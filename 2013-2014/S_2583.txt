Public Law 113-197
113th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To promote the non-exclusive use of electronic labeling for devices 
  licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. <<NOTE: Nov. 26, 
                          2014 -  [S. 2583]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Enhance 
Labeling, Accessing, and Branding of Electronic Licenses Act of 2014.>> 
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 47 USC 609 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhance Labeling, Accessing, and 
Branding of Electronic Licenses Act of 2014'' or the ``E-LABEL Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 47 USC 622 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Communications Commission (referred to in 
        this section as the ``Commission'') first standardized physical 
        labels for licensed products such as computers, phones, and 
        other electronic devices in 1973, and the Commission has 
        continually refined physical label requirements over time.
            (2) As devices become smaller, compliance with physical 
        label requirements can become more difficult and costly.
            (3) Many manufacturers and consumers of licensed devices in 
        the United States would prefer to have the option to provide or 
        receive important Commission labeling information digitally on 
        the screen of the device, at the discretion of the user.
            (4) An electronic labeling option would give flexibility to 
        manufacturers in meeting labeling requirements.
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION TO 
                    ALLOW ELECTRONIC LABELING.

    Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
``SEC. 720. <<NOTE: 47 USC 621.>>  OPTIONAL ELECTRONIC LABELING OF 
                        COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section--
            ``(1) the term `electronic labeling' means displaying 
        required labeling and regulatory information electronically; and
            ``(2) the term `radiofrequency device with display' means 
        any equipment or device that--
                    ``(A) is required under regulations of the 
                Commission to be authorized by the Commission before the 
                equipment or device may be marketed or sold within the 
                United States; and
                    ``(B) has the capability to digitally display 
                required labeling and regulatory information.

[[Page 128 STAT. 2056]]

    ``(b) <<NOTE: 47 USC 622.>>  Requirement To Promulgate Regulations 
for Electronic Labeling. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> --Not later than 9 months 
after the date of enactment of the Enhance Labeling, Accessing, and 
Branding of Electronic Licenses Act of 2014, the Commission shall 
promulgate regulations or take other appropriate action, as necessary, 
to allow manufacturers of radiofrequency devices with display the option 
to use electronic labeling for the equipment in place of affixing 
physical labels to the equipment.''.
SEC. 4. <<NOTE: 47 USC 622 note.>>  SAVINGS CLAUSE.

    The amendment made by section 3 shall not be construed to affect the 
authority of the Federal Communications Commission under section 302 of 
the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 302a) to provide for 
electronic labeling of devices.

    Approved November 26, 2014.
