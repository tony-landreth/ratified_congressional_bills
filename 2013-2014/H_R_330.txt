                                 An Act


 
To designate a Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial at the March 
      Field Air Museum in Riverside, California. <<NOTE: July 25, 
                          2014 -  [H.R. 330]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Distinguished 
Flying Cross National Memorial Act. 16 USC 431 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Distinguished Flying Cross National 
Memorial Act''.
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS NATIONAL 
                    MEMORIAL IN RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The most reliable statistics regarding the number of 
        members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross indicate that 126,318 members of the 
        Armed Forces received the medal during World War II, 
        approximately 21,000 members received the medal during the 
        Korean conflict, and 21,647 members received the medal during 
        the Vietnam War. Since the end of the Vietnam War, more than 203 
        Armed Forces members have received the medal in times of 
        conflict.
            (2) The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, 
        Missouri, burned down in 1973, and thus many more recipients of 
        the Distinguished Flying Cross may be undocumented. Currently, 
        the Department of Defense continues to locate and identify 
        members of the Armed Forces who have received the medal and are 
        undocumented.
            (3) The United States currently lacks a national memorial 
        dedicated to the bravery and sacrifice of those members of the 
        Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
        performed in aerial flight.
            (4) An appropriate memorial to current and former members of 
        the Armed Forces is under construction at March Field Air Museum 
        in Riverside, California.
            (5) This memorial will honor all those members of the Armed 
        Forces who have distinguished themselves in aerial flight, 
        whether documentation of such members who earned the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross exists or not.

    (b) Designation.--The memorial to members of the Armed Forces who 
have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, located at March Field 
Air Museum in Riverside, California, is hereby designated as the 
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial.

[[Page 128 STAT. 1728]]

    (c) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial designated by this 
section is not a unit of the National Park System, and the designation 
of the national memorial shall not be construed to require or permit 
Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the national 
memorial.

    Approved July 25, 2014.
