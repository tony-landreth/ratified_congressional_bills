Public Law 114-222
114th Congress

                                 An Act


 
     To deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: Sep. 28, 2016 -  [S. 2040]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Justice Against 
Sponsors of Terrorism Act.>> 
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 18 USC 1 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism 
Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 18 USC 2333 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) International terrorism is a serious and deadly problem 
        that threatens the vital interests of the United States.
            (2) International terrorism affects the interstate and 
        foreign commerce of the United States by harming international 
        trade and market stability, and limiting international travel by 
        United States citizens as well as foreign visitors to the United 
        States.
            (3) Some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through 
        affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds 
        outside of the United States for conduct directed and targeted 
        at the United States.
            (4) It is necessary to recognize the substantive causes of 
        action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under 
        chapter 113B of title 18, United States Code.
            (5) The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for 
        the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 
        (D.C. Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the 
        leading case regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and 
        conspiracy liability, including by the Supreme Court of the 
        United States, provides the proper legal framework for how such 
        liability should function in the context of chapter 113B of 
        title 18, United States Code.
            (6) Persons, entities, or countries that knowingly or 
        recklessly contribute material support or resources, directly or 
        indirectly, to persons or organizations that pose a significant 
        risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten the security 
        of nationals of the United States or the national security, 
        foreign policy, or economy of the United States, necessarily 
        direct their conduct at the United States, and should reasonably 
        anticipate being brought to court in the United States to answer 
        for such activities.
            (7) The United States has a vital interest in providing 
        persons and entities injured as a result of terrorist attacks 
        committed within the United States with full access to the

[[Page 130 STAT. 853]]

        court system in order to pursue civil claims against persons, 
        entities, or countries that have knowingly or recklessly 
        provided material support or resources, directly or indirectly, 
        to the persons or organizations responsible for their injuries.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants 
with the broadest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution of 
the United States, to seek relief against persons, entities, and foreign 
countries, wherever acting and wherever they may be found, that have 
provided material support, directly or indirectly, to foreign 
organizations or persons that engage in terrorist activities against the 
United States.
