    (a) Grants.--The Director of the National Science Foundation, 
through the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, shall 
continue to award competitive, merit-reviewed grants to support--
            (1) research and development of innovative out-of-school 
        STEM learning and emerging STEM learning environments in order 
        to improve STEM learning outcomes and engagement in STEM; and
            (2) research that advances the field of informal STEM 
        education.

    (b) Uses of Funds.--Activities supported by grants under this 
section may encompass a single STEM discipline, multiple STEM

        STEM; and
            (2) design and testing of innovative STEM learning models, 
        programs, and other resources for informal learning environments 
        to improve STEM learning outcomes and increase engagement for K-
        12 students, K-12 teachers, and the general public, including 
        design and testing of the scalability of models, programs, and 
        other resources.
