SEC. 314. REPORT ON CONTROL OF THE BROWN TREE SNAKE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), an invasive 
        species, is found in significant numbers on military 
        installations and in other areas on Guam, and constitutes a 
        serious threat to the ecology of Guam.
            (2) If introduced into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the 
        Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States, the 
        brown tree snake would pose an immediate and serious economic 
        and ecological threat.
            (3) The most probable vector for the introduction of the 
        brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, or the continental United States is the 
        movement from Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and cargo, 
        including the household goods of military personnel and other 
        military assets.
            (4) It is probable that the movement of military aircraft, 
        personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of military 
        personnel, from Guam to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, or the continental United States will increase 
        significantly coincident with the increase in the number of 
        military units and personnel stationed on Guam.
            (5) Current policies, programs, procedures, and dedicated 
        resources of the Department of Defense and of other departments 
        and agencies of the United States may not be sufficient to 
        adequately address the management, control, and eradication of 
        the brown tree snake on Guam and the increasing threat of the 
        introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, the 
        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,

[[Page 122 STAT. 56]]

        the continental United States, or other non-native environments.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the following:
            (1) The actions currently being taken (including the 
        resources being made available) by the Department of Defense to 
        control, and to develop new or existing techniques to control, 
        the brown tree snake on Guam and to prevent the introduction of 
        the brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the 
        Northern Mariana Island, the continental United States, or any 
        other non-native environment as a result of the movement from 
        Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and cargo, including the 
        household goods of military personnel and other military assets. 
        Such actions shall include any actions taken by the Department 
        of Defense to implement the recommendations of the Brown Tree 
        Snake Review Panel commissioned by the Department of the 
        Interior, as contained in the Review Panel's final report 
        entitled ``Review of Brown Tree Snake Problems and Control 
        Programs'' published in March 2005.
            (2) Current plans for enhanced future actions, policies, and 
        procedures and increased levels of resources in order to ensure 
        that the projected increase of military personnel stationed on 
        Guam does not increase the threat of introduction of the brown 
        tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the 
        Northern Mariana Islands, the continental United States, or 
        other non-native environments.
            (3) The results of management, control, and eradication 
        carried out by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with 
        the Secretary of the Interior, before the date on which the 
        report is submitted with respect to brown tree snakes through 
        the integrated natural resource management plans prepared for 
        military installations in Guam under the pilot program 
        authorized by section 101(g) of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 
        670a(g)).

                drinking water contamination described in this section 
                are necessary due to the potential negative health 
                impacts of these contaminants.
                    (B) The Secretary of the Navy will not be able to 
                identify or contact all former residents and former 
                employees due to the condition, non-existence, or 
                accessibility of records.
                    (C) It is the intent of Congress that the Secretary 
                of the Navy contact as many former residents and former 
                employees as quickly as possible.
            (2) ATSDR health survey.--
                    (A) Development.--
                          (i) In general.--Not later than 120 days after 
                      the date of the enactment of this Act, the ATSDR, 
                      in consultation with a well-qualified contractor 
                      selected by the ATSDR, shall develop a health 
                      survey that would voluntarily request of 
                      individuals described in subsections (a), (b), and 
                      (c) personal health information that may lead to 
                      scientifically useful health information 
                      associated with exposure to trichloroethylene 
                      (TCE), PCE, vinyl chloride, and the other 
                      contaminants identified in the ATSDR studies that 
                      may provide a basis for further reliable 
                      scientific studies of potentially adverse health 
                      impacts of exposure to contaminated water at Camp

            FAMILIES OF MEMBERS OF REGULAR AND RESERVE COMPONENTS 
            UNDERGOING DEPLOYMENT.

    (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study 
to determine the most effective means to enhance and improve family 
support programs for families of deployed members of the regular and 
reserve components of the Armed Forces before, during, and after 
deployment. The study shall also take into account the potential to 
utilize non-governmental and local private sector entities and other 
Federal agencies having expertise in health and well-being of families, 
including family members who are children, infants, or toddlers.
    (b) Elements.--The study shall include at a minimum the following:
            (1) The assessment of the types of information on health 
        care and mental health benefits and services and other community 
        resources that should be made available to members of the 
        regular and reserve components and their families, including--
                    (A) crisis services;
                    (B) marriage and family counseling; and
                    (C) financial counseling.
            (2) An assessment of means to improve support to the parents 
        and caretakers of military dependent children in order to 
        mitigate any adverse effects of the deployment of members on 
        such children, including consideration of the following:
                    (A) The need to develop materials for parents and 
                other caretakers of children to assist in responding to 
                the effects of such deployment on children, including 
                extended and multiple deployments and reunion (and the 
                death or injury of members during such deployment), and 
                the role that parents and caretakers can play in 
                addressing or mitigating such effects.
                    (B) The potential best practices that are identified 
                which build psychological and emotional resiliency in 
                children in coping with deployment.

[[Page 122 STAT. 127]]

                practices for outreach, training, and building 
                psychological and emotional resiliency in children.
                    (D) The effectiveness of training materials for 
                education, mental health, health, and family support

                    (E) The requirement to develop programs and 
                activities to increase awareness throughout the military 
                and civilian communities of the effects of deployment of 
                a military spouse or guardians for such children and 
                their families and to increase collaboration within such 
                communities to address and mitigate such effects.
                    (F) The development of training for early child care 
                and education, mental health, health care, and family 
                support professionals to enhance the awareness of such 
                professionals of their role in assisting families in 
                addressing and mitigating the adverse implications of 
                such deployment.
                    (G) The conduct of research on best practices for 
                building psychological and emotional resiliency in such 
                children in coping with the deployment of such members.

                such families;
                    (C) in reducing adverse outcomes for children of 
                such families, including poor academic performance, 
                behavioral problems, stress, and anxiety;
                    (D) in improving family readiness and post-
                deployment transition for such families; and
                    (E) in utilizing spouses of members of the Armed 
                Forces as counselors for families of deployed members, 
                in order to assist such families in coping before, 
                during, and after the deployment, and the best practices 
                for training spouses of members of the Armed Forces to 
                act as counselors for families of deployed members.

                within the local communities to ease transition.
            (5) An assessment of the impact of multiple overseas 
        deployments of members on their families, particularly in the 
        case of members serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
        Enduring Freedom, including financial impacts and emotional 
        impacts.
            (6) An assessment of the most effective timing of providing 
        information and support to the families of deployed members

                whether there were civilian medical and dental care 
                providers available in such area adequate to fill the 
                civilian positions created by the conversion of military 
                medical and dental positions to civilian positions in 
                such area.
                    (C) An analysis, by affected area, showing the 
                extent to which access to health care and cost of health 
                care was affected in both the direct care and purchased 
                care systems, including an assessment of the effect of

                costs

[[Page 122 STAT. 199]]

                or dental positions converted were in excess of the 
                military medical and dental positions needed to meet

            CENTER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Secretary of Defense proposed to disestablish all 
        elements of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, except the 
        National Medical Museum and the Tissue Repository, as part of 
        the recommendations of the Secretary for the closure of Walter 
        Reed Army Medical Center in the 2005 round of defense base 
        closure and realignment.
            (2) The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
        altered, but did not reject, the proposal of the Secretary of 
        Defense to disestablish the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
            (3) The Commission's recommendation that the Armed Forces 
        Institute of Pathology's ``capabilities not specified in this 
        recommendation will be absorbed into other DOD, Federal, or 
        civilian facilities'' provides the flexibility to retain a Joint 
        Pathology Center as a Department of Defense or Federal entity.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Armed 
Forces Institute of Pathology has provided important medical benefits to 
the Armed Forces and to the United States and that the Federal 
Government should retain a Joint Pathology Center.
    (c) <<NOTE: President.>>  Establishment.--
            (1) Establishment required.--The President shall establish 
        and maintain a Joint Pathology Center that shall function as the

        paragraph (3), the Joint Pathology Center shall be established 
        in the Department of Defense, consistent with the final 
        recommendations of the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        Commission, as approved by the President.
            (3) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Establishment in another 
        department.--If the President makes a determination, within 180 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, that the Joint 
        Pathology Center cannot be established in the Department of 
        Defense, the Joint Pathology Center shall be established as an 
        element of a Federal agency other than the Department of 
        Defense. The President shall incorporate the selection of such 
        agency into the determination made under this paragraph.

    (d) Services.--The Joint Pathology Center shall provide, at a 
minimum, the following:
            (1) Diagnostic pathology consultation services in medicine, 
        dentistry, and veterinary sciences.
            (2) Pathology education, to include graduate medical 
        education, including residency and fellowship programs, and 
        continuing medical education.

        October 1, 2010, the Department of Defense may not award a new 
        contract for lead systems integrator functions in the 
        acquisition of a major system to any entity that was not 
        performing lead systems integrator functions in the acquisition 
        of the major system prior to the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
            (2) Prohibition on lead systems integrators beyond low-rate 
        initial production.--Effective on the date of the enactment of 
        this Act, the Department of Defense may award a new contract for 
        lead systems integrator functions in the acquisition of a major 
        system only if--
                    (A) the major system has not yet proceeded beyond 
                low-rate initial production; or
                    (B) the Secretary of Defense determines in writing 
                that it would not be practicable to carry out the 
                acquisition without continuing to use a contractor to 
                perform lead systems integrator functions and that doing 
                so is in the best interest of the Department.
            (3) Requirements relating to determinations.--A 
        determination under paragraph (2)(B)--
                    (A) shall specify the reasons why it would not be

                continuing to use a contractor to perform lead systems 
                integrator functions (including a discussion of 
                alternatives, such as the use of the Department of 
                Defense workforce, or a system engineering and technical 
                assistance contractor);
                    (B) shall include a plan for phasing out the use of 
                contracted lead systems integrator functions over the 
                shortest period of time consistent with the interest of 
                the national defense;

                Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives 
                at least 45 days before the award of a contract pursuant 
                to the determination.

    (b) Acquisition Workforce.--
            (1) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that

                minimize and eventually eliminate the use of contractors 
                to perform lead systems integrator functions.
            (2) Report.--The Secretary shall include an update on the 
        progress made in complying with paragraph (1) in the annual

    (c) Exception for Contracts for Other Management Services.--The

            (1) The contract prohibits the contractor from performing 
        inherently governmental functions.
            (2) The Department of Defense organization responsible for 
        the development or production of the major system ensures that 
        Federal employees are responsible for--
                    (A) determining courses of action to be taken in the 
                best interest of the government; and
                    (B) determining best technical performance for the 
                warfighter.

        contract may not advise or recommend the award of a contract or 
        subcontract for the development or production of the major 
        system to an entity owned in whole or in part by the prime 
        contractor.

SEC. 922. <<NOTE: 50 USC 1521 note.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMPLETION 
            OF DESTRUCTION OF UNITED STATES CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCKPILE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
        Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
        Destruction, done at Paris on January 13, 1993 (commonly 
        referred to as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention''), requires 
        that destruction of the entire United States chemical weapons 
        stockpile be completed by not later than April 29, 2007.
            (2) In 2006, under the terms of the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention, the United States requested and received a one-time, 
        5-year extension of its chemical weapons destruction deadline to 
        April 29, 2012.
            (3) On April 10, 2006, the Secretary of Defense notified 
        Congress that the United States would not meet even the extended 
        deadline under the Chemical Weapons Convention for destruction 
        of the United States chemical weapons stockpile, but would 
        ``continue working diligently to minimize the time to complete 
        destruction without sacrificing safety and security'' and would 
        also ``continue requesting resources needed to complete 
        destruction as close to April 2012 as practicable''.

[[Page 122 STAT. 283]]

            (4) The United States chemical demilitarization program has 
        met its one percent, 20 percent, and extended 45 percent 
        destruction deadlines under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
            (5) Destroying the remaining stockpile of United States 
        chemical weapons is imperative for public safety and homeland 
        security, and doing so by April 2012, in accordance with the 
        current destruction deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention, is required by United States law.
            (6) The elimination of chemical weapons anywhere they exist 
        in the world, and the prevention of their proliferation, is of 
        utmost importance to the national security of the United States.
            (7) Section 921(b)(3) of the John Warner National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364; 120 
        Stat. 2359) contained a sense of Congress urging the Secretary 
        of Defense to ensure the elimination of the United States 
        chemical weapons stockpile in the shortest time possible, 
        consistent with the requirement to protect public health, 
        safety, and the environment.
            (8) Section 921(b)(4) of that Act contained a sense of 
        Congress urging the Secretary of Defense to propose a credible 
        treatment and disposal process with the support of affected 
        communities. In this regard, any such process should provide for 
        sufficient communication and consultation between 
        representatives of the Department of Defense and representatives 
        of affected States and communities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States is, and must remain, committed to 
        making every effort to safely dispose of its entire chemical 
        weapons stockpile by April 2012, the current destruction 
        deadline provided under the Chemical Weapons Convention, or as 
        soon thereafter as possible, and must carry out all of its other 
        obligations under the Convention; and
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should make every effort to 
        plan for, and to request in the annual budget of the President 
        submitted to Congress adequate funding to complete, the 
        elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in 
        accordance with United States obligations under the Chemical 
        Weapons Convention and in a manner that will protect public 
        health, safety, and the environment, as required by law.

    (c) Reports Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than March 15, 2008, and every 
        180 days thereafter until the year in which the United States

        weapons under the terms of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall submit to the members and committees 
        of Congress referred to in paragraph (3) a report on the

                for accelerating the completion of chemical weapons 
                destruction at each such facility, particularly in time 
                to meet the destruction deadline of April 29, 2012, 
                currently provided by the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
                and by December 31, 2017.
                    (C) A description of the funding required to achieve 
                each of the options for destruction described under

                estimate for each of the affected facilities included in 
                each such funding profile.
                    (D) A description of all actions being taken by the 
                United States to accelerate the destruction of its 
                entire stockpile of chemical weapons, agents, and 
                materiel in order to meet the current destruction 
                deadline under the Chemical Weapons Convention of April 
                29, 2012, or as soon thereafter as possible.
            (3) Members and committees of congress.--The members and

                                Avionics Modernization Program and the 
                                Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining 
                                Program, with partial completion of 
                                either such program being considered the 
                                point at which the continued execution 
                                of each program is no longer supported 
                                by the cost-effectiveness analysis.
                          (iii) At what specific fleet inventory for 
                      each organic aircraft, to include air refueling 
                      aircraft used in the airlift role, would it impede 
                      the ability of Civil Reserve Air Fleet 
                      participants to remain a viable augmentation 
                      option.
                    (D) An analysis and assessment of the lessons that 
                may be learned from the experience of the Air Force in 
                restarting the production line for the C-5 aircraft 
                after having closed the line for several years, and 
                recommendations for the actions that the Department of 
                Defense should take to ensure that the production line 
                for the C-17 aircraft could be restarted if necessary, 
                including--
                          (i) an analysis of the methods that were used 
                      and costs that were incurred in closing and re-
                      opening the production line for the C-5 aircraft;
                          (ii) an assessment of the methods and actions 
                      that should be employed and the expected costs and 
                      risks of closing and re-opening the production 
                      line for the C-17 aircraft in view of that 
                      experience.
                Such analysis and assessment should deal with issues 
                such as production work force, production facilities, 
                tooling, industrial base suppliers, contractor logistics 
                support versus organic maintenance, and diminished 
                manufacturing sources.
                    (E) Assessing the military capability, operational 
                availability, usefulness, service life and optimal mix 
                of intra-theater airlift aircraft, to include--
                          (i) the cost-effectiveness of procuring the 
                      Joint Cargo Aircraft versus procuring additional

        the Middle East and United States interests in the region; and

        failed state in Iraq or to contain the negative effects of a 
        failed state in Iraq.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) policies supported by the United States in the pursuit 
        of a political settlement in Iraq should be consistent with the 
        wishes of the Iraqi people and should not violate the 
        sovereignty of the nation of Iraq;
            (2) if the Iraqi people support a political settlement in 
        Iraq based on the final provisions of the Constitution of Iraq 
        that create a federal system of government and allow for the 
        creation of federal regions, consistent with the wishes of the 
        Iraqi people and their elected leaders, the United States should 
        actively support such a political settlement in Iraq;
            (3) the active support referred to in paragraph (2) should 
        include--
                    (A) calling on the international community, 
                including countries with troops in Iraq, the permanent 5 
                members of the United Nations Security Council, members 
                of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Iraq's neighbors--
                          (i) to support an Iraqi political settlement 
                      based on federalism;
                          (ii) to acknowledge the sovereignty and 
                      territorial integrity of Iraq; and
                          (iii) to fulfill commitments for the urgent 
                      delivery of significant assistance and debt relief 
                      to Iraq, especially those made by the member 
                      states of the Gulf Cooperation Council; and
                    (B) convening a conference for Iraqis to reach an 
                agreement on a comprehensive political settlement based 
                on the federalism law approved by the Iraqi Parliament 
                on October 11, 2006;
            (4) the United States should urge the Government of Iraq to 
        quickly agree upon and implement a law providing for the 
        equitable distribution of oil revenues, which is a critical 
        component of a comprehensive political settlement in Iraq, 
        including a potential settlement based upon federalism;

[[Page 122 STAT. 377]]

            (5) the steps described in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) 
        could lead to an Iraq that is stable, not a haven for 
        terrorists, and not a threat to its neighbors;
            (6) in pursuit of a political settlement in Iraq, whether 
        based on federalism or not, the United States should call on 
        Iraq's neighbors to pledge not to militarily intervene in or 
        destabilize Iraq; and
            (7) nothing in this Act should be construed in any way to 
        infringe on the sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq or to 
        imply that the United States wishes to impose a political 
        settlement in Iraq based on federalism if such a political 
        settlement is contrary to the wishes of the Iraqi people.

            IN THE REHABILITATION AND REINTEGRATION OF VETERANS WITH 
            TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.

    It is the sense of Congress that--

[[Page 122 STAT. 486]]

            (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs is a leader in the 
        field of traumatic brain injury care and coordination of such 
        care;
            (2) the Department of Veterans Affairs should have the 
        capacity and expertise to provide veterans who have a traumatic 
        brain injury with patient-centered health care, rehabilitation, 
        and community integration services that are comparable to or 
        exceed similar care and services available to persons with such 
        injuries in the academic and private sector;
            (3) rehabilitation for veterans who have a traumatic brain 
        injury should be individualized, comprehensive, and 
        interdisciplinary with the goals of optimizing the independence 
        of such veterans and reintegrating them into their communities;
            (4) family support is integral to the rehabilitation and 
        community reintegration of veterans who have sustained a 
        traumatic brain injury, and the Department should provide the 
        families of such veterans with education and support;
            (5) the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs have made efforts to provide a smooth transition of 
        medical care and rehabilitative services to individuals as they 
        transition from the health care system of the Department of 
        Defense to that of the Department of Veterans Affairs, but more 
        can be done to assist veterans and their families in the 
        continuum of the rehabilitation, recovery, and reintegration of 
        wounded or injured veterans into their communities;
            (6) in planning for rehabilitation and community 
        reintegration of veterans who have a traumatic brain injury, it 
        is necessary for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a 
        system for life-long case management for such veterans; and
            (7) in such system for life-long case management, it is 
        necessary to conduct outreach and to tailor specialized 
        traumatic brain injury case management and outreach to the 
        unique needs of veterans with traumatic brain injury who reside 
        in urban and non-urban settings.

SEC. 2828. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACTIONS TO PROTECT 
            INSTALLATIONS, RANGES, AND MILITARY AIRSPACE FROM 
            ENCROACHMENT.

    (a) Findings.--In light of the initial report of the Department of 
Defense submitted pursuant to section 2684a(g) of title 10, United 
States Code, and of the RAND Corporation report entitled ``The Thin 
Green Line: An Assessment of DoD's Readiness and Environmental 
Protection Initiative to Buffer Installation Encroachment'', Congress 
makes the following findings:
            (1) Development and loss of habitat in the vicinity of, or 
        in areas ecologically related to, military installations, 
        ranges, and airspace pose a continuing and significant threat to 
        the readiness of the Armed Forces.
            (2) The Range Sustainability Program (RSP) of the Department 
        of Defense, and in particular the Readiness and Environmental 
        Protection Initiative (REPI) involving agreements pursuant to 
        section 2684a of title 10, United States Code, have been 
        effective in addressing this threat to readiness with regard to 
        a number of important installations, ranges, and airspace.
            (3) The opportunities to take effective action to protect 
        installations, ranges, and airspace from encroachment is in many 
        cases transient, and delay in taking action will result in 
        either higher costs or permanent loss of the opportunity 
        effectively to address encroachment.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense should--

        Emergency Management Agency organizes its efforts.
            (3) Despite the obvious need for experienced and routinely 
        exercised operational headquarters skilled in disaster response, 
        no such headquarters have been established.
            (4) Such a headquarters would be appropriately located on 
        available Federal property in Region VI of the Federal Emergency 
        Management Agency, which includes Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,

        and Rita or a natural or man-made disaster of similar scope, 
        including adequate beds, food stores, and decontamination 
        stations to triage radiation or other chemical or biological 
        agent contamination victims.

        Western roots.
            (4) Representative Hefley's efforts on the Committee on

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The maritime loan guarantee program was established by 
        the Congress through the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to encourage 
        domestic shipbuilding by making available federally backed loan 
        guarantees for new construction to ship owners and operators.
            (2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and 
        successful history of ship construction with a low historical 
        default rate.
            (3) The current process for review of applications for 
        maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has 
        effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the 
        Congress.
            (4) The President has requested no funding for the loan 
        guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster 
        the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant 
        marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.
            (5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a 
        competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by 
        government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.

        modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise 
        trade and restore a competitive position in the world 
        shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.
            (7) The maritime loan guarantee program is a useful tool to 
        encourage domestic shipbuilding, preserving a vital industrial 
        capacity critical to the security of the United States.
