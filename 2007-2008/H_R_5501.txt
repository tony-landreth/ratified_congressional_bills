SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Section 2 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7601) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
            ``(29) On May 27, 2003, the President signed this Act into 
        law, launching the largest international public health program 
        of its kind ever created.
            ``(30) Between 2003 and 2008, the United States, through the 
        President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in 
        conjunction with other bilateral programs and the multilateral 
        Global Fund has helped to--
                    ``(A) provide antiretroviral therapy for over 
                1,900,000 people;
                    ``(B) ensure that over 150,000 infants, most of whom 
                would have likely been infected with HIV during 
                pregnancy or childbirth, were not infected; and
                    ``(C) provide palliative care and HIV prevention 
                assistance to millions of other people.
            ``(31) While United States leadership in the battles against 
        HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria has had an enormous impact, 
        these diseases continue to take a terrible toll on the human 
        race.
            ``(32) According to the 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update of the 
        Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)--
                    ``(A) an estimated 2,100,000 people died of AIDS-
                related causes in 2007; and
                    ``(B) an estimated 2,500,000 people were newly 
                infected with HIV during that year.
            ``(33) According to the World Health Organization, malaria 
        kills more than 1,000,000 people per year, 70 percent of whom 
        are children under 5 years of age.
            ``(34) According to the World Health Organization, \1/3\ of 
        the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis 
        bacterium, and tuberculosis is 1 of the greatest infectious 
        causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 1,600,000 people 
        per year.
            ``(35) Efforts to promote abstinence, fidelity, the correct 
        and consistent use of condoms, the delay of sexual debut, and 
        the reduction of concurrent sexual partners represent important 
        elements of strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS.
            ``(36) According to UNAIDS--
                    ``(A) women and girls make up nearly 60 percent of 
                persons in sub-Saharan Africa who are HIV positive;
                    ``(B) women and girls are more biologically, 
                economically, and socially vulnerable to HIV infection; 
                and
                    ``(C) gender issues are critical components in the 
                effort to prevent HIV/AIDS and to care for those 
                affected by the disease.
            ``(37) Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are 
        otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live

[[Page 122 STAT. 2920]]

        in areas of high HIV prevalence may be vulnerable to the disease 
        or its socioeconomic effects.
            ``(38) Lack of health capacity, including insufficient 
        personnel and inadequate infrastructure, in sub-Saharan Africa 
        and other regions of the world is a critical barrier that limits 
        the effectiveness of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, 
        and malaria, and to achieve other global health goals.
            ``(39) On March 30, 2007, the Institute of Medicine of the 
        National Academies released a report entitled `PEPFAR 
        Implementation: Progress and Promise', which found that budget 
        allocations setting percentage levels for spending on 
        prevention, care, and treatment and for certain subsets of 
        activities within the prevention category--

                U.S. Global AIDS Initiative';

                balance of attention to activities within the 4 
                categories of prevention, treatment, care, and orphans 
                and vulnerable children';
                    ``(E) `have also limited PEPFAR's ability to tailor 
                its activities in each country to the local epidemic and 
                to coordinate with the level of activities in the 
                countries' national plans'; and
                    ``(F) should be removed by Congress and replaced

                      Country Teams to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator 
                      and to Congress'; and

                      linked to and commensurate with necessary efforts 
                      to achieve both country and overall performance 
                      targets for prevention, treatment, care, and 
                      orphans and vulnerable children'.
            ``(40) The United States Government has endorsed the 
        principles of harmonization in coordinating efforts to combat 
        HIV/AIDS commonly referred to as the `Three Ones', which 
        includes--
                    ``(A) 1 agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that
