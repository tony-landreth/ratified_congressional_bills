                        COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
                        INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND CONGRESSIONAL 
                        INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States (referred to in this section as the ``9/11 
        Commission'') conducted a lengthy review of the facts and 
        circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
        2001, including those relating to the intelligence community, 
        law enforcement agencies, and the role of congressional 
        oversight and resource allocation.
            (2) In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that--
                    (A) congressional oversight of the intelligence 
                activities of the United States is dysfunctional;
                    (B) under the rules of the Senate and the House of 
                Representatives in effect at the time the report was 
                completed, the committees of Congress charged with 
                oversight of the intelligence activities lacked the 
                power, influence, and sustained capability to meet the 
                daunting challenges faced by the intelligence community 
                of the United States;
                    (C) as long as such oversight is governed by such 
                rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives, 
                the people of the United States will not get the 
                security they want and need;
                    (D) a strong, stable, and capable congressional 
                committee structure is needed to give the intelligence 
                community of the United States appropriate oversight, 
                support, and leadership; and
                    (E) the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission 
                in its final report will not succeed if congressional 
                oversight of the intelligence community in the United 
                States is not changed.
            (3) The 9/11 Commission recommended structural changes to 
        Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence activities.
            (4) Congress has enacted some of the recommendations made by 
        the 9/11 Commission and is considering implementing additional 
        recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.

[[Page 121 STAT. 337]]

            (5) The Senate adopted Senate Resolution 445 in the 108th 
        Congress to address some of the intelligence oversight 
        recommendations of the 9/11 Commission by abolishing term limits 
        for the members of the Select Committee on Intelligence, 
        clarifying jurisdiction for intelligence-related nominations, 
        and streamlining procedures for the referral of intelligence-
        related legislation, but other aspects of the 9/11 Commission 
        recommendations regarding intelligence oversight have not been 
        implemented.

    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Select 
Committee on Intelligence of the Senate each, or jointly, should--
            (1) undertake a review of the recommendations made in the 
        final report of the 9/11 Commission with respect to intelligence 
        reform and congressional intelligence oversight reform;
            (2) review and consider any other suggestions, options, or 
        recommendations for improving intelligence oversight; and
            (3) not later than December 21, 2007, submit to the Senate a 
        report that includes the recommendations of the committees, if 
        any, for carrying out such reforms.

                 TITLE VIII--PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

SEC. 801. MODIFICATION OF AUTHORITIES RELATING TO PRIVACY AND 
                        CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD.

    (a) Modification of Authorities.--Section 1061 of the National 
Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) is amended 
to read as follows:
``SEC. 1061. PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES OVERSIGHT BOARD.

    ``(a) In General.--There is <<NOTE: Establishment.>> established as 
an independent agency within the executive branch a Privacy and Civil 
Liberties Oversight Board (referred to in this section as the `Board').

    ``(b) Findings.--Consistent with the report of the National 
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes 
the following findings:
            ``(1) In conducting the war on terrorism, the Government may 
        need additional powers and may need to enhance the use of its 
        existing powers.
            ``(2) This shift of power and authority to the Government 
        calls for an enhanced system of checks and balances to protect 
        the precious liberties that are vital to our way of life and to 
        ensure that the Government uses its powers for the purposes for 
        which the powers were given.
            ``(3) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States correctly concluded that `The choice between 
        security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more 
        likely to endanger America's liberties than the success of a 
        terrorist attack at home. Our history has shown us that 
        insecurity threatens liberty. Yet, if our liberties are 
        curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to 
        defend.'.

    ``(c) Purpose.--The Board shall--
            ``(1) analyze and review actions the executive branch takes 
        to protect the Nation from terrorism, ensuring that the need for 
        such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and 
        civil liberties; and
            ``(2) ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately 
        considered in the development and implementation of laws, 
        regulations, and policies related to efforts to protect the 
        Nation against terrorism.

    ``(d) Functions.--
            ``(1) Advice and counsel on policy development and 
        implementation.--The Board shall--

                terrorism, including the development and adoption of

                (f) of section 1016;
                    ``(B) review the implementation of new and existing

                requirements.

    (d) Deployment.--The Secretary shall--
            (1) use the additional explosives detection canine teams as 
        part of the Department's efforts to strengthen security across 
        the Nation's transportation network, and may use the canine 
        teams on a more limited basis to support other homeland security 
        missions, as determined appropriate by the Secretary;
            (2) make available explosives detection canine teams to all 
        modes of transportation, for high-risk areas or to address 
        specific threats, on an as-needed basis and as otherwise

subcontractor of such agency, or an officer or employee of such agency, 
shall not discharge, demote, suspend, reprimand, or in any other way

        exist; or
            (C) refusing to authorize the use of any safety- or 
        security-related equipment, track, or structures, if the

        the equipment, track, or structures are in a hazardous safety or 
        security condition, if the conditions described in paragraph (2) 
        of this subsection exist.

    (2) A refusal is protected under paragraph (1)(B) and (C) if--

                danger of death or serious injury; and
                    (ii) the urgency of the situation does not allow 
                sufficient time to eliminate the danger without such 
                refusal; and
            (C) the employee, where possible, has notified the public 
        transportation agency of the existence of the hazardous

    (c) Enforcement Action.--

[[Page 121 STAT. 416]]

            (1) Filing and notification.--A <<NOTE: Deadline.>> person 
        who believes that he or she has been discharged or otherwise 
        discriminated against by any person in violation of subsection 
        (a) or (b) may, not later than 180 days after the date on which 
        such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his or 
        her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging 
        such discharge or discrimination. Upon receipt of a complaint 
        filed under this paragraph, the Secretary of Labor shall notify, 
        in writing, the person named in the complaint and the person's 
        employer of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations 
        contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence 
        supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be 
        afforded to such person under paragraph (2).
            (2) Investigation; <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> preliminary order.--
                    (A) In general.--Not <<NOTE: Notification.>> later 
                than 60 days after the date of receipt of a complaint 
                filed under paragraph (1) and after affording the person 
                named in the complaint an opportunity to submit to the 
                Secretary of Labor a written response to the complaint 
                and an opportunity to meet with a representative of the 
                Secretary of Labor to present statements from witnesses, 
                the Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation 
                and determine whether there is reasonable cause to 
                believe that the complaint has merit and notify, in 
                writing, the complainant and the person alleged to have 
                committed a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of the 
                Secretary of Labor's findings. If the Secretary of Labor 
                concludes that there is a reasonable cause to believe 
                that a violation of subsection (a) or (b) has occurred, 
                the Secretary of Labor shall accompany the Secretary of 
                Labor's findings with a preliminary order providing the 
                relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 
                days after the date of notification of findings under 
                this paragraph, either the person alleged to have 
                committed the violation or the complainant may file 
                objections to the findings or preliminary order, or 
                both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of 
                such objections shall not operate to stay any 
                reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. 
                Such hearings shall be conducted expeditiously. If a 
                hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the 
                preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is 
                not subject to judicial review.
                    (B) Requirements.--
                          (i) Required showing by complainant.--The 
                      Secretary of Labor shall dismiss a complaint filed 
                      under this subsection and shall not conduct an 
                      investigation otherwise required under 
                      subparagraph (A) unless the complainant makes a 
                      prima facie showing that any behavior described in 
                      subsection (a) or (b) was a contributing factor in 
                      the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the 
                      complaint.
                          (ii) Showing by employer.--Notwithstanding a 
                      finding by the Secretary of Labor that the 
                      complainant has made the showing required under 
                      clause (i), no investigation otherwise required 
                      under paragraph (A) shall be conducted if the 
                      employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing 
                      evidence, that the employer would

[[Page 121 STAT. 417]]

                      have taken the same unfavorable personnel action 
                      in the absence of that behavior.
                          (iii) Criteria for determination by secretary 
                      of labor.--The Secretary of Labor may determine 
                      that a violation of subsection (a) or (b) has 
                      occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that 
                      any behavior described in subsection (a) or (b) 
                      was a contributing factor in the unfavorable 
                      personnel action alleged in the complaint.
                          (iv) Prohibition.--Relief may not be ordered 
                      under paragraph (A) if the employer demonstrates 
                      by clear and convincing evidence that the employer 
                      would have taken the same unfavorable personnel 
                      action in the absence of that behavior.
            (3) Final order.--
                    (A) Deadline for issuance; settlement agreements.--
                Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of 
                a hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Labor 
                shall issue a final order providing the relief 
                prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint. 
                At any time before issuance of a final order, a 
                proceeding under this subsection may be terminated on 
                the basis of a settlement agreement entered into by the 
                Secretary of Labor, the complainant, and the person 
                alleged to have committed the violation.
                    (B) Remedy.--If, in response to a complaint filed 
                under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor determines 
                that a violation of subsection (a) or (b) has occurred, 
                the Secretary of Labor shall order the person who 
                committed such violation to--
                          (i) take affirmative action to abate the 
                      violation; and
                          (ii) provide the remedies described in 
                      subsection (d).
                    (C) Order.--If an order is issued under subparagraph 
                (B), the Secretary of Labor, at the request of the 
                complainant, shall assess against the person against 
                whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate 
                amount of all costs and expenses (including attorney and 
                expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined 
                by the Secretary of Labor, by the complainant for, or in 
                connection with, bringing the complaint upon which the 
                order was issued.
                    (D) Frivolous complaints.--If the Secretary of Labor 
                finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous 
                or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary of Labor 
                may award to the prevailing employer reasonable attorney 
                fees not exceeding $1,000.
            (4) Review.--
                    (A) Appeal to court of appeals.--Any person 
                adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under 
                paragraph (3) may obtain review of the order in the 
                United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which 
                the violation, with respect to which the order was 
                issued, allegedly occurred or the circuit in which the 
                complainant resided on the date of such violation. 
                The <<NOTE: Deadline.>> petition for review must be 
                filed not later than 60 days after the date of the 
                issuance 


[[Page 121 STAT. 418]]

                of the final order of the Secretary of Labor. Review 
                shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States 
                Code. The commencement of proceedings under this 
                subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, 
                operate as a stay of the order.
                    (B) Limitation on collateral attack.--An order of 
                the Secretary of Labor with respect to which review 
                could have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall 
                not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or 
                other civil proceeding.
            (5) Enforcement of order by secretary of labor.--Whenever 
        any person has failed to comply with an order issued under 
        paragraph (3), the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in 
        the United States district court for the district in which the 
        violation was found to occur to enforce such order. In actions 
        brought under this paragraph, the district courts shall have 
        jurisdiction to grant all appropriate relief including, but not 
        limited to, injunctive relief and compensatory damages.
            (6) Enforcement of order by parties.--
                    (A) Commencement of action.--A person on whose 
                behalf an order was issued under paragraph (3) may 
                commence a civil action against the person to whom such 
                order was issued to require compliance with such order. 
                The appropriate United States district court shall have 
                jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in 
                controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to 
                enforce such order.
                    (B) Attorney fees.--The court, in issuing any final 
                order under this paragraph, may award costs of 
                litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert 
                witness fees) to any party whenever the court determines 
                such award is appropriate.
            (7) De novo review.--With respect to a complaint under 
        paragraph (1), if the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final 
        decision within 210 days after the filing of the complaint and 
        if the delay is not due to the bad faith of the employee, the 
        employee may bring an original action at law or equity for de 
        novo review in the appropriate district court of the United 
        States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action 
        without regard to the amount in controversy, and which action 
        shall, at the request of either party to such action, be tried 
        by the court with a jury. The action shall be governed by the 
        same legal burdens of proof specified in paragraph (2)(B) for 
        review by the Secretary of Labor.

    (d) Remedies.--
            (1) In general.--An employee prevailing in any action under

        the employee whole.

        (including an action described in (c)(7)) shall include--
                    (A) reinstatement with the same seniority status 
                that the employee would have had, but for the 
                discrimination;
                    (B) any backpay, with interest; and
                    (C) compensatory damages, including compensation for 
                any special damages sustained as a result of the 
                discrimination, including litigation costs, expert 
                witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees.

[[Page 121 STAT. 419]]

both this section and another provision of law for the same allegedly

suspension, threats, harassment, reprimand, retaliation, or any other 
manner of discrimination provided by Federal or State law.

        Homeland Security shall disclose to the Attorney General the 
        name of an employee described in paragraph (1) of this 
        subsection if the matter is referred to the Attorney General for

        request, has filed a complaint or begun a proceeding related to 
        a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety or security 
        regulation, standard, or order, or has testified or will testify 
        in such a proceeding; or
            ``(ii) the person perceives that the employee has filed or 
        is about to file a complaint or has begun or is about to begin a 
        proceeding related to a violation of a commercial motor vehicle 
        safety or security regulation, standard, or order;

SEC. 1801. <<NOTE: 50 USC 2901.>> FINDINGS.

    The 9/11 Commission has made the following recommendations:
            (1) Strengthen ``counter-proliferation'' efforts.--The 
        United States should work with the international community to 
        develop laws and an international legal regime with universal 
        jurisdiction to enable any state in the world to capture, 
        interdict, and prosecute smugglers of nuclear material.
            (2) Expand the proliferation security initiative.--In 
        carrying out the Proliferation Security Initiative, the United 
        States should--
                    (A) use intelligence and planning resources of the 
                North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance;
                    (B) make participation open to non-NATO countries; 
                and
                    (C) encourage Russia and the People's Republic of 
                China to participate.
            (3) Support the cooperative threat reduction program.--The 
        United States should expand, improve, increase resources for, 
        and otherwise fully support the Cooperative Threat Reduction 
        program.

 Subtitle A--Quality Educational Opportunities in Predominantly Muslim 
                               Countries.

SEC. 2011. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2228 note.>> FINDINGS; POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist 
        Attacks Upon the United States stated that ``[e]ducation that 
        teaches tolerance, the dignity and value of each individual, and 
        respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global 
        strategy to eliminate Islamist terrorism''.
            (2) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist 
        Attacks Upon the United States concluded that ensuring 
        educational opportunity is essential to the efforts of the 
        United States to defeat global terrorism and recommended that 
        the United States Government ``should offer to join with other 
        nations in generously supporting [spending funds] . . . directly 
        for building and operating primary and secondary schools in 
        those Muslim states that commit to sensibly investing their own 
        money in public education''.
            (3) While Congress endorsed such a program in the 
        Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public 
        Law 108-458), such a program has not been established.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to work toward the goal of dramatically increasing the 
        availability of modern basic education through public schools in 
        predominantly Muslim countries, which will reduce the influence 
        of radical madrassas and other institutions that promote 
        religious extremism;
            (2) to join with other countries in generously supporting 
        the International Muslim Youth Opportunity Fund authorized under 
        section 7114 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention 
        Act of 2004, as amended by section 2012 of this Act, with the 
        goal of building and supporting public primary and secondary 
        schools in predominantly Muslim countries that commit to 
        sensibly investing the resources of such countries in modern 
        public education;
            (3) to offer additional incentives to increase the 
        availability of modern basic education in predominantly Muslim 
        countries; and
            (4) to work to prevent financing of educational institutions 
        that support radical Islamic fundamentalism.

            (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 Commission'') 
        declared that the United States ``should work with friends to 
        develop mutually agreed-on principles for the detention and 
        humane treatment of captured international terrorists who are 
        not being held under a particular country's criminal laws'' and 
        recommended that the United States engage its allies

[[Page 121 STAT. 518]]

        ``to develop a common coalition approach toward the detention 
        and humane treatment of captured terrorists''.
            (2) A number of investigations remain ongoing by countries 
        that are close United States allies in the war on terrorism 
        regarding the conduct of officials, employees, and agents of the 
        United States and of other countries related to conduct 
        regarding detainees.
            (3) The Secretary of State has launched an initiative to try 
        to address the differences between the United States and many of 
        its allies regarding the treatment of detainees.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary, acting through the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, 
should continue to build on the Secretary's efforts to engage United 
States allies to develop a common coalition approach, in compliance with 
Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and other applicable legal 
principles, toward the detention and humane treatment of individuals 
detained during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, or 
in connection with United States counterterrorist operations.
    (c) Reporting to Congress.--
            (1) Briefings.--The Secretary of State shall keep the 
        appropriate congressional committees fully and currently 
        informed of the progress of any discussions between the United 
        States and its allies regarding the development of the common 
        coalition approach described in subsection (b).
            (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation 
        with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, shall 
        submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on 
        any progress towards developing the common coalition approach 
        described in subsection (b).

        Government of Afghanistan, with assistance from the United 
        States and the international community, has achieved some 
        notable successes, including--

                and criminal networks.
                    (B) Drug trafficking and corruption.
                    (C) Weak institutions of administration, security, 
                and justice, including pervasive lack of the rule of 
                law.
                    (D) Poverty, unemployment, and lack of provision of 
                basic services.
            (4) The United States and the international community must 
        significantly increase political, economic, and military support 
        to Afghanistan to ensure its long-term stability and prosperity, 
        and to deny violent extremist groups such as al Qaeda sanctuary 
        in Afghanistan.

    (b) Statements of Policy.--The following shall be the policies of 
the United States:
            (1) The United States shall vigorously support the people 
        and Government of Afghanistan as they continue to commit to the 
        path toward a government representing and protecting the rights 
        of all Afghans, and shall maintain its long-term commitment to 
        the people of Afghanistan by increased assistance and the 
        continued deployment of United States troops in Afghanistan as 
        long as the Government of Afghanistan supports such United 
        States involvement.
            (2) In order to reduce the ability of the Taliban and al 
        Qaeda to finance their operations through the opium trade, the 
        President shall engage aggressively with the Government of 
        Afghanistan, countries in the region or otherwise influenced by 
        the trade and transit of narcotics, as well as North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) partners of the United States, and in 
        consultation with Congress, to assess the success of the current 
        Afghan counter-narcotics strategy and to explore additional 
        options for addressing the narcotics crisis in Afghanistan, 
        including possible changes in rules of engagement for NATO and 
        Coalition forces for participation in actions against narcotics 
        trafficking and kingpins, and the provision of comprehensive 
        assistance to farmers who rely on opium for their livelihood, 
        including through the promotion of alternative crops and 
        livelihoods.
            (3) The United States shall continue to work with and 
        provide assistance to the Government of Afghanistan to 
        strengthen local and national government institutions and the 
        rule of law, including the training of judges and prosecutors, 
        and to train and equip the Afghan National Security Forces.
            (4) The United States shall continue to call on NATO members 
        participating in operations in Afghanistan to meet their 
        commitments to provide forces and equipment, and to lift 
        restrictions on how such forces can be deployed.
            (5) The United States shall continue to foster greater 
        understanding and cooperation between the Governments of 
        Afghanistan and Pakistan by taking the following actions:

[[Page 121 STAT. 520]]

                    (A) Facilitating greater communication, including 
                through official mechanisms such as the Tripartite 
                Commission and the Joint Intelligence Operations Center, 
                and by promoting other forms of exchange between the 
                parliaments and civil society of the two countries.
                    (B) Urging the Government of Afghanistan to enter 
                into a political dialogue with Pakistan with respect to 
                all issues relating to the border between the two 
                countries, with the aim of establishing a mutually-
                recognized and monitored border, open to human and 
                economic exchange, and with both countries fully 
                responsible for border security.

    (c) Statement of Congress.--Congress strongly urges that the 
Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) be 
reauthorized and updated to take into account new developments in 
Afghanistan and in the region so as to demonstrate the continued support 
by the United States for the people and Government of Afghanistan.
    (d) Emergency Increase in Effective Police Training and Policing 
Operations.--
            (1) Congressional finding.--Congress finds that police 
        training programs in Afghanistan have achieved far less return 
        on substantial investment to date and require a substantive 
        review and justification of the means and purposes of such 
        assistance, consequent to any provision of additional resources.
            (2) Assistance authorized.--The President shall make 
        increased efforts, on an urgent basis, to--
                    (A) dramatically improve the capability and 
                effectiveness of United States and international police 
                trainers, mentors, and police personnel for police 
                training programs in Afghanistan, as well as develop a 
                pretraining screening program;
                    (B) increase the numbers of such trainers, mentors, 
                and personnel only if such increase is determined to 
                improve the performance and capabilities of the 
                Afghanistan civil security forces; and
                    (C) assist the Government of Afghanistan, in 
                conjunction with the Afghanistan civil security forces 
                and their leadership, in addressing the corruption 
                crisis that is threatening to undermine Afghanistan's 
                future.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter until 
        September 30, 2010, the President shall transmit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report on United States 
        efforts to fulfill the requirements of this subsection. The 
        report required by this paragraph may be transmitted 
        concurrently with any similar report required by the Afghanistan 
        Freedom Support Act of 2002.
SEC. 2042. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2375 note.>> PAKISTAN.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) A democratic, stable, and prosperous Pakistan that is a 
        full and reliable partner in the struggle against the Taliban, 
        al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups, and is a responsible 
        steward of its nuclear weapons and technology, is vital to the 
        national security of the United States.

[[Page 121 STAT. 521]]

            (2) Since September 11, 2001, the Government of Pakistan has 
        been a critical ally and an important partner in removing the 
        Taliban regime in Afghanistan and combating al Qaeda.
            (3) Pakistan has made great sacrifices in the shared 
        struggle against al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist groups, engaging 
        in military operations that have led to the deaths of hundreds 
        of Pakistani security personnel and enduring acts of terrorism 
        that have killed hundreds of Pakistani civilians.
            (4) Publicly-stated goals of the Government of Pakistan and 
        the national interests of the United States are in close 
        agreement in many areas, including--
                    (A) curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
                technology;
                    (B) combating poverty and corruption;
                    (C) enabling effective government institutions, 
                including public education;
                    (D) promoting democracy and the rule of law, 
                particularly at the national level;
                    (E) addressing the continued presence of Taliban and 
                other violent extremist forces throughout the country;
                    (F) maintaining the authority of the Government of 
                Pakistan in all parts of its national territory;
                    (G) securing the borders of Pakistan to prevent the 
                movement of militants and terrorists into other 
                countries and territories; and
                    (H) effectively dealing with violent extremism.
            (5) The opportunity exists for shared effort in helping to 
        achieve correlative goals with the Government of Pakistan, 
        particularly--
                    (A) increased United States assistance to Pakistan, 
                as appropriate, to achieve progress in meeting the goals 
                of subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (4);
                    (B) increased commitment on the part of the 
                Government of Pakistan to achieve the goals of paragraph 
                (4)(D), particularly given continued concerns, based on 
                the conduct of previous elections, regarding whether 
                parliamentary elections scheduled for 2007 will be free, 
                fair, and inclusive of all political parties and carried 
                out in full accordance with internationally-recognized 
                democratic norms; and
                    (C) increased commitment on the part of the 
                Government of Pakistan to take actions described in 
                paragraph (4)(E), particularly given--
                          (i) the continued operation of the Taliban's 
                      Quetta shura, as noted by then-North Atlantic 
                      Treaty Organization Supreme Allied Commander 
                      General James Jones in testimony before the Senate 
                      Foreign Relations Committee on September 21, 2006; 
                      and
                          (ii) the continued operation of al Qaeda 
                      affiliates Lashkar-e Taiba and Jaish-e Muhammad, 
                      sometimes under different names, as demonstrated 
                      by the lack of meaningful action taken against 
                      Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, Maulana Masood Azhar, and 
                      other known leaders and members of such terrorist 
                      organizations; and
                    (D) increased commitment on the part of the 
                Government of the United States in regard to working 
                with all elements of Pakistan society in helping to 
                achieve the

[[Page 121 STAT. 522]]

                correlative goals described in subparagraphs (A) through 
                (H) of paragraph (4).

    (b) Statements of Policy.--The following shall be the policy of the 
United States:
            (1) To maintain and deepen its friendship and long-term 
        strategic relationship with Pakistan.
            (2) To work with the Government of Pakistan to combat 
        international terrorism, especially in the frontier provinces of 
        Pakistan, and to end the use of Pakistan as a safe haven for 
        terrorist groups, including those associated with al Qaeda or 
        the Taliban.
            (3) To support robust funding for programs of the United 
        States Agency for International Development and the Department 
        of State that assist the Government of Pakistan in working 
        toward the goals described in subsection (a)(4), as the 
        Government of Pakistan demonstrates a clear commitment to 
        building a moderate, democratic state.
            (4) To work with the international community to secure 
        additional financial and political support to effectively 
        implement the policies set forth in this subsection.
            (5) To facilitate a just resolution of the dispute over the 
        territory of Kashmir, to the extent that such facilitation is 
        invited and welcomed by the Governments of Pakistan and India 
        and by the people of Kashmir.
            (6) To facilitate greater communication and cooperation 
        between the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan for the 
        improvement of bilateral relations and cooperation in combating 
        terrorism in both countries.
            (7) To work with the Government of Pakistan to dismantle 
        existing proliferation networks and prevent the proliferation of 
        nuclear technology.

    (c) Strategy Relating to Pakistan.--
            (1) Requirement for report on strategy.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President 
        shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        report that describes the long-term strategy of the United 
        States to engage with the Government of Pakistan to achieve the 
        goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (H) of subsection 
        (a)(4) and to carry out the policies described in subsection 
        (b).
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        transmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex, if necessary.

    (d) Limitation on United States Security Assistance to Pakistan.--
            (1) Limitation.--For fiscal year 2008, United States 
        assistance under chapter 2 of part II of the Foreign Assistance 
        Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2311 et seq.) or section 23 of the Arms 
        Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) may not be provided to, and 
        a license for any item controlled under the Arms Export Control 
        Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) may not be approved for, Pakistan 
        until the President transmits to the appropriate congressional 
        committees a report that contains a determination of the 
        President that the Government of Pakistan--
                    (A) is committed to eliminating from Pakistani 
                territory any organization such as the Taliban, al 
                Qaeda, or

[[Page 121 STAT. 523]]

                any successor, engaged in military, insurgent, or 
                terrorist activities in Afghanistan;
                    (B) is undertaking a comprehensive military, legal, 
                economic, and political campaign to achieving the goal 
                described in subparagraph (A); and
                    (C) is currently making demonstrated, significant, 
                and sustained progress toward eliminating support or 
                safe haven for terrorists.
            (2) Memorandum of justification.--The President shall 
        include in the report required by paragraph (1) a memorandum of

        annex, if necessary.

    (e) Nuclear Proliferation.--
            (1) Congressional finding.--Congress finds that the 
        maintenance by any country of a procurement or supply network 
        for the illicit proliferation of nuclear and missile 
        technologies would be inconsistent with that country being 
        considered an ally of the United States.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        national security interest of the United States will best be 
        served if the United States develops and implements a long-term 
        strategy to improve the United States relationship with Pakistan 
        and works with the Government of Pakistan to stop nuclear 
        proliferation.

    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--
            (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to 
        the President such sums as may be necessary to provide 
        assistance described in subsection (d)(1) for Pakistan for 
        fiscal year 2008 in accordance with the requirements of 
        subsection (d)(1).
            (2) Other funds.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated 
        under this subsection are in addition to amounts otherwise 
        available for such purposes.
            (3) Declaration of policy.--Congress declares that the 
        amount of funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of 
        appropriations under paragraph (1) and for subsequent fiscal 
        years shall be determined by the extent to which the Government 
        of Pakistan displays demonstrable progress in--
                    (A) preventing al Qaeda and other terrorist 
                organizations from operating in the territory of 
                Pakistan, including eliminating terrorist training camps 
                or facilities, arresting members and leaders of 
                terrorist organizations, and countering recruitment 
                efforts;
                    (B) preventing the Taliban from using the territory 
                of Pakistan as a sanctuary from which to launch attacks 
                within Afghanistan, including by arresting Taliban 
                leaders, stopping cross-border incursions, and 
                countering recruitment efforts; and
                    (C) implementing democratic reforms, including 
                allowing free, fair, and inclusive elections at all 
                levels of government in accordance with internationally-
                recognized democratic norms, and respecting the 
                independence of the press and judiciary.

[[Page 121 STAT. 524]]

            (4) Biannual reports to congress.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of State shall submit 
                to the appropriate congressional committees a biannual 
                report describing in detail the extent to which the 
                Government of Pakistan has displayed demonstrable 
                progress in meeting the goals described in subparagraphs

        President to exercise waivers of foreign assistance restrictions 
        with respect to Pakistan through September 30, 2003, and for

        115 Stat. 403), is amended--
                    (A) in section 1(b)--
                          (i) in the heading, to read as follows:

                          (ii) in paragraph (1), by striking ``any 
                      provision'' and all that follows through ``that

        subsection (f)(3).
SEC. 2043. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2656 note.>> SAUDI ARABIA.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has 
        ``been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism. At the 
        level of high policy, Saudi Arabia's leaders cooperated with 
        American diplomatic initiatives aimed at the Taliban or

[[Page 121 STAT. 525]]

        Pakistan before 9/11. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's society 
        was a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from 
        individuals and through charities. It was the society that 
        produced 15 of the 19 hijackers.''.
            (2) Saudi Arabia has an uneven record in the fight against 
        terrorism, especially with respect to terrorist financing, 
        support for radical madrassas, a lack of political outlets for 
        its citizens, and restrictions on religious pluralism, that 
        poses a threat to the security of the United States, the 
        international community, and Saudi Arabia itself.
            (3) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States concluded that the ``problems in the U.S.-Saudi 
        relationship must be confronted, openly''. It recommended that 
        the two countries build a relationship that includes a ``shared 
        commitment to political and economic reform . . . and a shared 
        interest in greater tolerance and cultural respect, translating 
        into a commitment to fight the violent extremists who foment 
        hatred''.
            (4) The United States has a national security interest in 
        working with the Government of Saudi Arabia to combat 
        international terrorists that operate within that country or 
        that operate outside Saudi Arabia with the support of citizens 
        of Saudi Arabia.
            (5) The United States and Saudi Arabia established a 
        Strategic Dialogue in 2005, which provides a framework for the 
        two countries to discuss a range of bilateral issues at high 
        levels, including counterterrorism policy and political and 
        economic reforms.
            (6) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to support the Government of Saudi Arabia in undertaking 
        a number of political and economic reforms, including increasing 
        anti-terrorism operations conducted by law enforcement agencies, 
        providing more political and religious rights to its citizens, 
        increasing the rights of women, engaging in comprehensive 
        educational reform, enhancing monitoring of charitable 
        organizations, and promulgating and enforcing domestic laws and 
        regulation on terrorist financing.

    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to engage with the Government of Saudi Arabia to openly 
        confront the issue of terrorism, as well as other problematic 
        issues such as the lack of political freedoms;
            (2) to enhance counterterrorism cooperation with the 
        Government of Saudi Arabia; and
            (3) to support the efforts of the Government of Saudi Arabia 
        to make political, economic, and social reforms, including 
        greater religious freedom, throughout the country.

    (c) Progress in Counterterrorism and Other Cooperation.--
            (1) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report that--
                    (A) describes the long-term strategy of the United 
                States--
                          (i) to engage with the Government of Saudi 
                      Arabia to facilitate political, economic, and 
                      social reforms, including greater religious 
                      freedom, that will enhance

[[Page 121 STAT. 526]]

                      the ability of the Government of Saudi Arabia to 
                      combat international terrorism; and
                          (ii) to work with the Government of Saudi 
                      Arabia to combat terrorism, including through 
                      effective measures to prevent and prohibit the 
                      financing of terrorists by Saudi institutions and 
                      citizens; and
                    (B) provides an assessment of the progress made by 
                Saudi Arabia since 2001 on the matters described in 
                subparagraph (A), including--
                          (i) whether Saudi Arabia has become a party to 
                      the International Convention for the Suppression 
                      of the Financing of Terrorism; and
                          (ii) the activities and authority of the Saudi 
                      Nongovernmental National Commission for Relief and 
                      Charity Work Abroad.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        transmitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex, if necessary.

    TITLE XXI--ADVANCING <<NOTE: Advance Democratic Values, Address 
Nondemocratic Countries, and Enhance Democracy Act of 2007.>> DEMOCRATIC 
VALUES
SEC. 2101. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Advance Democratic Values, Address 
Nondemocratic Countries, and Enhance Democracy Act of 2007'' or the 
``ADVANCE Democracy Act of 2007''.
SEC. 2102. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8201 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Declaration of Independence, the 
        United States Constitution, and the United Nations Universal 
        Declaration of Human Rights declare that all human beings are 
        created equal and possess certain rights and freedoms, including 
        the fundamental right to participate in the political life and 
        government of their respective countries.
            (2) The development of democracy constitutes a long-term 
        challenge that goes through unique phases and paces in 
        individual countries as such countries develop democratic 
        institutions such as a thriving civil society, a free media, and 
        an independent judiciary, and must be led from within such 
        countries, including by nongovernmental and governmental 
        reformers.
            (3) Individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and 
        movements that support democratic principles, practices, and 
        values are under increasing pressure from some governments of 
        nondemocratic countries (as well as, in some cases, from 
        governments of democratic transition countries), including by 
        using administrative and regulatory mechanisms to undermine the 
        activities of such individuals, organizations, and movements.
            (4) Democratic countries have a number of instruments 
        available for supporting democratic reformers who are committed 
        to promoting effective, nonviolent change in nondemocratic 
        countries and who are committed to keeping their countries on 
        the path to democracy.
            (5) United States efforts to promote democracy and protect 
        human rights can be strengthened to improve assistance for

[[Page 121 STAT. 527]]

        such reformers, including through an enhanced role for United 
        States diplomats when properly trained and given the right 
        incentives.
            (6) The promotion of democracy requires a broad-based effort 
        with cooperation between all democratic countries, including 
        through the Community of Democracies.
SEC. 2103. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8202.>> STATEMENT OF POLICY.

        strong legislatures, a thriving civil society, transparent and 
        professional independent governmental auditing agencies, 
        civilian control of the military, and institutions that promote 
        the rights of minorities and women;
            (5) to use instruments of United States influence to 
        support, promote, and strengthen democratic principles, 
        practices, and values, including the right to free, fair, and

                nondemocratic countries that aspire to live in freedom 
                and establish full democracy in such countries; and
                    (B) providing political, economic, and other support 
                to foreign countries and individuals, nongovernmental 
                organizations, and movements that are willingly 
                undertaking a transition to democracy; and
            (6) to strengthen cooperation with other democratic

    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections in section 1(b) of 
such Act is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 706

``Sec. 707. Quadrennial Homeland Security Review.''.

SEC. 2402. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE PREVENTION OF 
                          RADICALIZATION LEADING TO IDEOLOGICALLY-
                          BASED VIOLENCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States is engaged in a struggle against a 
        transnational terrorist movement of radical extremists that 
        plans, prepares for, and engages in acts of ideologically-based 
        violence worldwide.
            (2) The threat of radicalization that leads to 
        ideologically-based violence transcends borders and has been 
        identified as a potential threat within the United States.
            (3) Radicalization has been identified as a precursor to 
        terrorism caused by ideologically-based groups.
            (4) Countering the threat of violent extremists 
        domestically, as well as internationally, is a critical element 
        of the plan of the United States for success in the fight 
        against terrorism.
            (5) United States law enforcement agencies have identified 
        radicalization that leads to ideologically-based violence as an 
        emerging threat and have in recent years identified cases of 
        extremists operating inside the United States, known as 
        ``homegrown'' extremists, with the intent to provide support 
        for, or directly commit, terrorist attacks.
            (6) Alienation of Muslim populations in the Western world 
        has been identified as a factor in the spread of radicalization 
        that could lead to ideologically-based violence.
            (7) Many other factors have been identified as contributing 
        to the spread of radicalization and resulting acts of 
        ideologically-based violence. Among these is the appeal of left-
        wing and right-wing hate groups, and other hate groups, 
        including

[[Page 121 STAT. 547]]

        groups operating in prisons. Other such factors must be examined 
        and countered as well in order to protect the homeland from 
        violent extremists of every kind.
            (8) Radicalization leading to ideologically-based violence 
        cannot be prevented solely through law enforcement and 
        intelligence measures.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other relevant 
Federal agencies, should make a priority of countering domestic 
radicalization that leads to ideologically-based violence by--
            (1) using intelligence analysts and other experts to better 
        understand the process of radicalization from sympathizer to 
        activist to terrorist;
            (2) recruiting employees with diverse worldviews, skills, 
        languages, and cultural backgrounds, and expertise;
            (3) consulting with experts to ensure that the lexicon used 
        within public statements is precise and appropriate and does not 
        aid extremists by offending religious, ethnic, and minority 
        communities;
            (4) addressing prisoner radicalization and post-sentence 
        reintegration, in concert with the Attorney General and State 
        and local corrections officials;
            (5) pursuing broader avenues of dialogue with minority 
        communities, including the American Muslim community, to foster 
        mutual respect, understanding, and trust; and
            (6) working directly with State, local, and community 
        leaders to--
                    (A) educate such leaders about the threat of 
                radicalization that leads to ideologically-based 
                violence and the necessity of taking preventative action 
                at the local level; and
                    (B) facilitate the sharing of best practices from 
                other countries and communities to encourage outreach to 
                minority communities, including the American Muslim 
                community, and develop partnerships among and between 
                all religious faiths and ethnic groups.
