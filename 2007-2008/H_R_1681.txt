    This Act may be cited as the ``The American National Red Cross 
Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 36 USC 300101 note.>> FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The 
        American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.
            (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The American 
        National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') commissioned an 
        independent review and analysis of the Board of Governors' role, 
        composition, size, relationship with management, governance 
        relationship with chartered units of The American National Red 
        Cross, and whistle blower and audit functions.
            (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, 
        entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st Century'' 
        (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors recommended 
        changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and other 
        governing documents of The American National Red Cross to 
        modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of 
        Governors and governance structure of The American National Red 
        Cross.
            (4) It is in the national interest to create a more 
        efficient governance structure of The American National Red 
        Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to support 
        the critical mission of The American National Red Cross in the 
        21st century.
            (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of 
        the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic oversight 
        board and for The American National Red Cross to amend its 
        bylaws, consistent with the recommendations described in the 
        Governance Report, to clarify the role of the Board of Governors 
        and to outline the areas of its responsibility, including--

[[Page 121 STAT. 104]]

                    (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement 
                for The American National Red Cross;
                    (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's 
                strategic plan and maintaining strategic oversight of 
                operational matters;
                    (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level 
                of compensation of the corporation's chief executive 
                officer;
                    (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the 
                compensation of the senior leadership team and providing 
                for management succession;
                    (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit 
                process, internal controls, and legal compliance;
                    (F) holding management accountable for performance;
                    (G) providing oversight of the financial stability 
                of the corporation;
                    (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the 
                corporation;
                    (I) ensuring the chapters of the corporation are 
                geographically and regionally diverse;
                    (J) providing oversight of the protection of the 
                brand of the corporation; and
                    (K) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the 
                corporation.
            (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors is 
        a critical component of effective governance for The American 
        National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the national interest 
        that The American National Red Cross amend its bylaws to provide 
        a method of selection consistent with that described in the 
        Governance Report.
            (B) The new method of selection should replace the current 
        process by which--
                    (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board 
                of Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which 
                includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other 
                individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;
                    (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors 
                are nominated by a Board committee and elected by the 
                Board of Governors; and
                    (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are 
                appointed by the President of the United States.
            (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance 
        Report reflects the single category of members of the Board of 
        Governors that will result from the implementation of this Act:
                    (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of 
                the Board of Governors) would be nominated by a single 
                committee of the Board of Governors taking into account 
                the criteria outlined in the Governance Report to assure 
                the expertise, skills, and experience of a governing 
                board.
                    (ii) The nominated members would be considered for 
                approval by the full Board of Governors and then 
                submitted to The American National Red Cross annual 
                meeting of delegates for election, in keeping with the 
                standard corporate practice whereby shareholders of a 
                corporation elect members of a board of directors at its 
                annual meeting.
            (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American 
        National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United

[[Page 121 STAT. 105]]

        States, and it is in the national interest that the 
        Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any changes 
        to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights and 
        obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry out its 
        purposes.
            (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in 
        carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and meeting 
        its various obligations, the effectiveness of The American 
        National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation of an 
        organizational ombudsman who--
                    (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute 
                resolution practitioner whose major function will be to 
                provide confidential and informal assistance to the many 
                internal and external stakeholders of The American 
                National Red Cross;
                    (B) will report to the chief executive officer and 
                the audit committee of the Board of Governors; and
                    (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in 
                The American National Red Cross.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of 
        American society, but these organizations can only fulfill their 
        important roles by maintaining the trust of the American public;
            (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and 
        transparency, which are the principal goals of the 
        recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance 
        Report and this Act;
            (3) Federal and State action play an important role in 
        ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting 
        standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public;
            (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will remain 
        a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United States, and 
        it has the rights and obligations consistent with that status, 
        The American National Red Cross nevertheless should maintain 
        appropriate communications with State regulators of charitable 
        organizations and should cooperate with them as appropriate in 
        specific matters as they arise from time to time; and
            (5) while The American National Red Cross is and will remain 
        a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United States, and 
        it has the rights and obligations consistent with that status, 
        The American National Red Cross nevertheless should maintain 
        appropriate communications and collaborations with local, 
        community, and faith-based non-profit organizations, including 
        those organizations that work within minority communities.
