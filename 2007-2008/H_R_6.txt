SEC. 245. STUDY OF THE ADEQUACY OF TRANSPORTATION OF DOMESTICALLY-
            PRODUCED RENEWABLE FUEL BY RAILROADS AND OTHER MODES OF 
            TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of Transportation, shall jointly conduct a study of 
        the adequacy of transportation of domestically-produced 
        renewable fuels by railroad and other modes of transportation as 
        designated by the Secretaries.
            (2) Components.--In conducting the study under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretaries shall--
                    (A) consider the adequacy of existing railroad and 
                other transportation and distribution infrastructure, 
                equipment, service and capacity to move the necessary 
                quantities of domestically-produced renewable fuel 
                within the timeframes;
                    (B)(i) consider the projected costs of moving the 
                domestically-produced renewable fuel by railroad and 
                other modes of transportation; and
                    (ii) consider the impact of the projected costs on 
                the marketability of the domestically-produced renewable 
                fuel;
                    (C) identify current and potential impediments to 
                the reliable transportation and distribution of adequate 
                supplies of domestically-produced renewable fuel at 
                reasonable prices, including practices currently 
                utilized by domestic producers, shippers, and receivers 
                of renewable fuels;
                    (D) consider whether adequate competition exists 
                within and between modes of transportation for the 
                transportation and distribution of domestically-produced 
                renewable fuel and, whether inadequate competition leads 
                to an unfair price for the transportation and 
                distribution of domestically-produced renewable fuel or 
                unacceptable service for transportation of domestically-
                produced renewable fuel;
                    (E) consider whether Federal agencies have adequate 
                legal authority to address instances of inadequate 
                competition when inadequate competition is found to 
                prevent domestic producers for renewable fuels from 
                obtaining a fair and reasonable transportation price or 
                acceptable service for the transportation and 
                distribution of domestically-produced renewable fuels;

[[Page 121 STAT. 1547]]

                    (F) consider whether Federal agencies have adequate 
                legal authority to address railroad and transportation 
                service problems that may be resulting in inadequate 
                supplies of domestically-produced renewable fuel in any 
                area of the United States;
                    (G) consider what transportation infrastructure 
                capital expenditures may be necessary to ensure the 
                reliable transportation of adequate supplies of 
                domestically-produced renewable fuel at reasonable 
                prices within the United States and which public and 
                private entities should be responsible for making such 
                expenditures; and
                    (H) provide recommendations on ways to facilitate 
                the reliable transportation of adequate supplies of 
                domestically-produced renewable fuel at reasonable 
                prices.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has a quantity of renewable energy 
        resources that is sufficient to supply a significant portion of 
        the energy needs of the United States;
            (2) the agricultural, forestry, and working land of the 
        United States can help ensure a sustainable domestic energy 
        system;
            (3) accelerated development and use of renewable energy 
        technologies provide numerous benefits to the United States, 
        including improved national security, improved balance of 
        payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental 
        quality, and abundant, reliable, and affordable energy for all 
        citizens of the United States;
            (4) the production of transportation fuels from renewable 
        energy would help the United States meet rapidly growing 
        domestic and global energy demands, reduce the dependence of the 
        United States on energy imported from volatile regions of the 
        world that are politically unstable, stabilize the cost and 
        availability of energy, and safeguard the economy and security 
        of the United States;
            (5) increased energy production from domestic renewable 
        resources would attract substantial new investments in energy 
        infrastructure, create economic growth, develop new jobs for the 
        citizens of the United States, and increase the income for farm, 
        ranch, and forestry jobs in the rural regions of the United 
        States;
            (6) increased use of renewable energy is practical and can 
        be cost effective with the implementation of supportive policies 
        and proper incentives to stimulate markets and infrastructure; 
        and

[[Page 121 STAT. 1723]]

            (7) public policies aimed at enhancing renewable energy 
        production and accelerating technological improvements will 
        further reduce energy costs over time and increase market 
        demand.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it is the 
goal of the United States that, not later than January 1, 2025, the 
agricultural, forestry, and working land of the United States should--
            (1) provide from renewable resources not less than 25 
        percent of the total energy consumed in the United States; and
            (2) continue to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food, 
        feed, and fiber.

SEC. 934. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17373.>>  CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY 
            COMPENSATION FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.

    (a) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
                U.S.C. 2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson 
                Act'')--
                          (i) provides a predictable legal framework 
                      necessary for nuclear projects; and
                          (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation 
                      in the event of a nuclear incident in the United 
                      States;
                    (B) the Price-Anderson Act, in effect, provides 
                operators of nuclear powerplants with insurance for 
                damage arising out of a nuclear incident and funds the 
                insurance primarily through the assessment of a 
                retrospective premium from each operator after the 
                occurrence of a nuclear incident;
                    (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
                Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, 
                will establish a global system--
                          (i) to provide a predictable legal framework 
                      necessary for nuclear energy projects; and
                          (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable 
                      compensation in the event of a nuclear incident;
                    (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear 
                suppliers that face potentially unlimited liability for 
                nuclear incidents that are not covered by the Price-
                Anderson Act by replacing a potentially open-ended 
                liability with a predictable liability regime that, in 
                effect, provides nuclear suppliers with insurance for 
                damage arising out of such an incident;
                    (E) the Convention also benefits United States 
                nuclear facility operators that may be publicly liable 
                for a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional 
                early source of funds to compensate damage arising out 
                of the Price-Anderson incident;
                    (F) the combined operation of the Convention, the 
                Price-Anderson Act, and this section will augment the 
                quantity of assured funds available for victims in a 
                wider variety of nuclear incidents while reducing the 
                potential liability of United States suppliers without 
                increasing potential costs to United States operators;

[[Page 121 STAT. 1742]]

                    (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of 
                the United States to contribute to the supplementary 
                compensation fund established by the Convention;
                    (H) any such contribution should be funded in a 
                manner that does not--
                          (i) upset settled expectations based on the 
                      liability regime established under the Price-
                      Anderson Act; or
                          (ii) shift to Federal taxpayers liability 
                      risks for nuclear incidents at foreign 
                      installations;
                    (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds 
                already available under the Price-Anderson Act should be 
                used; and
                    (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the 
                United States not covered by the Price-Anderson Act, a 
                retrospective premium should be prorated among nuclear 
                suppliers relieved from potential liability for which 
                insurance is not available.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to allocate the 
        contingent costs associated with participation by the United 
        States in the international nuclear liability compensation 
        system established by the Convention on Supplementary 
        Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 
        1997--
                    (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by 
                using funds made available under section 170 of the 
                Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the 
                contingent costs in a manner that neither increases the 
                burdens nor decreases the benefits under section 170 of 
                that Act; and
                    (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the 
                United States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by 
                allocating the contingent costs equitably, on the basis 
                of risk, among the class of nuclear suppliers relieved 
                by the Convention from the risk of potential liability 
                resulting from any covered incident outside the United 
                States.

note.>>  XIV--POOL AND SPA SAFETY

SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa 
Safety Act''.

SEC. 1402. <<NOTE: 15 USC 8001.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Of injury-related deaths, drowning is the second leading 
        cause of death in children aged 1 to 14 in the United States.
            (2) In 2004, 761 children aged 14 and under died as a result 
        of unintentional drowning.
            (3) Adult supervision at all aquatic venues is a critical 
        safety factor in preventing children from drowning.
            (4) Research studies show that the installation and proper 
        use of barriers or fencing, as well as additional layers of 
        protection, could substantially reduce the number of childhood 
        residential swimming pool drownings and near drownings.

                          (i) the enclosure of all outdoor residential 
                      pools and spas by barriers to entry that will 
                      effectively prevent small children from gaining 
                      unsupervised and unfettered access to the pool or 
                      spa;
                          (ii) that all pools and spas be equipped with

                      by pool or spa drains;

[[Page 121 STAT. 1798]]

                          (iii) that pools and spas built more than 1 
                      year after the date of the enactment of such 
                      statute have--
                                    (I) more than 1 drain;
