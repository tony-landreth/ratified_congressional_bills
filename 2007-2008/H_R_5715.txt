        sections 428, 428B, or 428H, whether as a result of inadequate 
        liquidity for such loans or for other reasons, the Secretary, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is authorized 
        to purchase, or enter into forward commitments to purchase, from

SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is a sense of Congress that, at a time when our economy is 
fragile and higher education and retraining opportunities are more 
important than ever--
            (1) the Federal financial institutions, such as the Federal 
        Financing Bank and Federal Reserve, and federally chartered 
        private entities such as the Federal Home Loan Banks and others, 
        should consider, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury 
        and the Secretary of Education, using available authorities in a 
        timely manner, if needed, to assist in ensuring that students 
        and families can access Federal student loans for academic year 
        2008-2009, and if needed in the subsequent academic year, in a 
        manner that results in no increased costs to taxpayers; and
            (2) any action taken as a result of such consideration 
        should in no way limit or delay the Secretary of Education's 
        authority to operate the lender-of-last-resort provisions of 
        section 428(j) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended 
        by this Act), nor the authority to purchase Federal Family 
        Education Loan Program loans, as authorized by section 459A of 
        such Act (as added by this Act).

Act of 2005 with respect to the impact on--
            (1) tuition, fees, and room and board at institutions of 
        higher education; and
            (2) private loan borrowing by students and parents for 
        attendance at institutions of higher education.

    (b) Study Components.--The study required under subsection (a) shall 
be conducted for each major sector of institutions of higher education 
over a 5-year time period. The report shall specifically analyze the 
following:
            (1) Whether, on average, tuition, fees, and room and board 
        increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in each such sector 
        after the increases in Federal loan limits take effect.
            (2) Whether the amount of private educational loans taken 
        out by students (and their parents) at institutions in each such 
        sector to pay tuition, fees, and room and board increase, 
        decrease, or remain unchanged.

    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General shall provide an interim report to the 
Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate 
including the initial results of the study conducted under this section. 
The Comptroller General shall follow up with such Committees after the 
third year and the fifth year after such date of enactment.
