SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Duncan Hunter 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Representative Duncan Hunter was elected to serve 
        northern and eastern San Diego in 1980 and served in the House 
        of Representatives until the end of the 110th Congress in 2009, 
        representing the people of California's 52d Congressional 
        district.
            (2) Previous to his service in Congress, Representative 
        Hunter served in the Army's 173rd Airborne and 75th Ranger 
        Regiment from 1969 to 1971.
            (3) During the Vietnam conflict, Representative Hunter's 
        distinguished service was recognized by the award of the Bronze 
        Star and Air Medal, as well as the National Defense Service 
        Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal.
            (4) Representative Hunter served on the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the House of Representatives for 28 years, including 
        service as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Research and 
        Development from 2001 through 2002 and the Subcommittee on 
        Military Procurement from 1995 through 2000, the Chairman of the 
        full committee from 2003 through 2006, and the ranking member of 
        the full committee from 2007 through 2008.
            (5) Representative Hunter has persistently advocated for a 
        more efficient military organization on behalf of the American 
        people, to ensure maximum war-fighting capability and troop 
        safety.
            (6) Representative Hunter is known by his colleagues to put 
        the security of the Nation above all else and to provide for the 
        men and women in uniform who valiantly dedicate and sacrifice 
        themselves for the protection of the Nation.
            (7) Representative Hunter has demonstrated this devotion to 
        the troops by working to authorize and ensure quick deployment 
        of add-on vehicle armor and improvised explosive device jammers, 
        which have been invaluable in protecting the troops from attack 
        in Iraq.

[[Page 122 STAT. 4357]]

            (8) Representative Hunter worked to increase the size of the 
        U.S. Armed Forces, which resulted in significant increases in 
        the size of the Army and Marine Corps.
            (9) Representative Hunter has been a leader in ensuring 
        sufficient force structure and end-strength, including through 
        the 2006 Committee Defense Review, to meet any challenges to the 
        Nation. His efforts to increase the size of the Army and Marine 
        Corps contributed to the enactment by the Congress and the 
        subsequent implementation by the Administration of the larger 
        forces.
            (10) Representative Hunter is a leading advocate for 
        securing America's borders.
            (11) Representative Hunter led efforts to strengthen the 
        United States Industrial Base by working to enact legislation 
        that ensures that the national industrial base will be able to 
        design and manufacture those products critical to America's 
        national security.

    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Honorable Duncan Hunter, Representative from California, has discharged

                        FUNCTION AND CRITERIA FOR CRITICAL 
                        FUNCTIONS.

    (a) Development and Implementation.--The Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, in consultation with appropriate representatives

States Code, shall--
            (1) review the definitions of the term ``inherently 
        governmental function'' described in subsection (b) to determine 
        whether such definitions are sufficiently focused to ensure that 
        only officers or employees of the Federal Government or members 
        of the Armed Forces perform inherently governmental functions or 
        other critical functions necessary for the mission of a Federal 
        department or agency;

        that would--
                    (A) address any deficiencies in the existing 
                definitions, as determined pursuant to paragraph (1);
                    (B) reasonably apply to all Federal departments and 
                agencies; and

                agency is able to identify each position within that 
                department or agency that exercises an inherently 
                governmental function and should only be performed by 
                officers or employees of the Federal Government or 
                members of the Armed Forces;
            (3) develop criteria to be used by the head of each such 
        department or agency to--
                    (A) identify critical functions with respect to the 
                unique missions and structure of that department or 
                agency; and
                    (B) identify each position within that department or 
                agency that, while the position may not exercise an 
                inherently governmental function, nevertheless should 
                only be performed by officers or employees of the 
                Federal Government or members of the Armed Forces to 
                ensure the department or agency maintains control of its 
                mission and operations;
            (4) in addition to the actions described under paragraphs 
        (1), (2), and (3), provide criteria that would identify 
        positions within Federal departments and agencies that are to be 
        performed by officers or employees of the Federal Government or 
        members of the Armed Forces to ensure that the head of each 
        Federal department or agency--
                    (A) develops and maintains sufficient organic 
                expertise and technical capability;
                    (B) develops guidance to implement the definition of 
                inherently governmental as described in paragraph (2) 
                and the criteria for critical functions as described in 
                paragraph (3) in a manner that is consistent with agency 
                missions and operational goals; and

                members of the Armed Forces are filling critical 
                management roles by identifying--
                          (i) functions, activities, or positions, or

                units of the reserve components), under the jurisdiction

                Armed Forces (including members of the regular 
                components and members of the reserve components) who

                time during the period beginning on October 1, 2001, and 
                ending on September 30, 2008, due to failure to meet 
                applicable medical or dental standards, and an 
                assessment of whether the unreadiness of such members 
                for deployment could reasonably have been mitigated by 
                actions of the members concerned to maintain individual 
                medical or dental readiness.
                    (D) A description of any actual or perceived

                including barriers associated with the following:
                          (i) Quality or cost of, or access to, medical 
                      and dental care.
                          (ii) Availability of programs and incentives

                    (E) Such recommendations for legislative or 
                administrative action as the Secretary considers 
                appropriate to ensure the medical and dental readiness

                the Armed Forces, including recommendations regarding 
                the following:
                          (i) The advisability of requiring that fitness 
                      reports of members of the Armed Forces include--

                                member meets such standards and the 
                                anticipated schedule for meeting such 
                                standards.
                          (ii) The advisability of establishing a 
                      mandatory promotion standard relating to

    (a) Assessment Required.--The <<NOTE: Study. Reports.>> Secretary of 
Defense shall commission a study and report by an independent commission 
or a federally funded research and development center to assess the 
effectiveness of the processes used by the Department of Defense for the 
generation of urgent operational need requirements, and the acquisition 
processes used to fulfill such requirements. Such assessment shall 
include the following:
            (1) A description and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
        procedures used to generate, validate, and fulfill warfighting 
        requirements through the urgent operational need and joint 
        urgent operational need processes, including--
                    (A) the extent to which joint and urgent operational 
                need statements are used to document required capability 
                gaps or are used to request specific acquisition 
                outcomes, such as specific systems or equipment;
                    (B) the effectiveness of the processes used by each 
                of the military departments and the various elements of 
                the Department of Defense to prioritize and fulfill

                organization and the joint rapid acquisition cell; and
                    (C) the timeliness and responsiveness of the 
                processes used by the military departments and the

                and validate urgent operational needs statements and 
                joint urgent operational needs statements.

[[Page 122 STAT. 4518]]

            (2) An evaluation of the extent to which joint urgent 
        operational need statements are used to avoid using service-
        specific urgent operational need and acquisition processes or to 
        document non-urgent capability gaps.
            (3) An evaluation of the extent to which joint acquisition 
        entities maintain oversight, once a military department or 
        defense agency has been designated as responsible for execution 
        and fielding of a capability in response to a joint urgent 
        operational need statement, including oversight of--
                    (A) the responsiveness of the military department or 
                agency in execution;

                delivered in response to the joint urgent operational 
                need statement; and
                    (C) the concurrent development of a long term 
                acquisition and sustainment strategy.
            (8) Recommendations regarding--
                    (A) best practices and process improvements to 
                ensure that urgent operational needs statements and 
                joint urgent operational needs statements are presented 
                to appropriate authorities for review and validation not 
                later than 60 days after the documents are submitted;
                    (B) common definitions and standards for urgent 
                operational needs statements and joint urgent 
                operational need statements;
                    (C) best practices and process improvements for the 
                creation, evaluation, prioritization, and fulfillment of 
                urgent operational need statements and joint urgent 
                operational need statements; and

                should be consolidated or expanded.

    ``(a) Authority To Designate Major Subprograms as Subject to 
Acquisition Reporting Requirements.--(1) If the Secretary of Defense 
determines that a major defense acquisition program requires the 
delivery of two or more categories of end items which differ 
significantly from each other in form and function, the Secretary may 
designate each such category of end items as a major subprogram for the 
purposes of acquisition reporting under this chapter.
    ``(2) <<NOTE: Notification. Deadline.>> The Secretary shall notify 
the congressional defense committees in writing of any proposed 
designation pursuant to paragraph (1) not less than 30 days before the 
date such designation takes effect.

    ``(b) Reporting Requirements.--If the Secretary designates a major 
subprogram of a major defense acquisition program in accordance with 
subsection (a), Selected Acquisition Reports, unit cost reports, and 
program baselines under this chapter shall reflect cost, schedule, and 
performance information--
            ``(1) for the major defense acquisition program as a whole; 
        and
            ``(2) for each major subprogram of the major defense 
        acquisition program so designated.

    ``(c) Requirement to Cover Entire Major Defense Acquisition 
Program.--If a subprogram of a major defense acquisition program is 
designated as a major subprogram under subsection

[[Page 122 STAT. 4521]]

(a), all other elements of the major defense acquisition program shall 
be appropriately organized into one or more subprograms under the major

    ``(d) Definitions.--Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
section 2432(a) of this title, in the case of a major defense 
acquisition program for which the Secretary has designated one or more 
major subprograms under this section for the purposes of this chapter--
            ``(1) the term `program acquisition unit cost' applies at 
        the level of the subprogram and means the total cost for the 
        development and procurement of, and specific military 
        construction for, the major defense acquisition program that is 
        reasonably allocable to each such major subprogram, divided by 
        the relevant number of fully-configured end items to be produced 
        under such major subprogram;
            ``(2) the term `procurement unit cost' applies at the level 
        of the subprogram and means the total of all funds programmed to 
        be available for obligation for procurement for each such major 
        subprogram, divided by the number of fully-configured end items 
        to be procured under such major subprogram;
            ``(3) the term `major contract', with respect to a 
        designated major subprogram, means each of the six largest 
        prime, associate, or Government furnished equipment contracts 
        under the subprogram that is in excess of $40,000,000 and that 
        is not a firm-fixed price contract; and
            ``(4) the term `life cycle cost', with respect to a 
        designated major subprogram, means all costs of development, 
        procurement, military construction, and operations and support,

                a regular basis;
            (9) include performance measures to evaluate the

shall include, at a minimum, an examination of the following matters:
            (1) The variety and complexity of acquisitions conducted by 
        each Federal agency covered by the plan, and the workforce 
        needed to effectively carry out such acquisitions.
            (2) The development of a sustainable funding model to 
        support efforts to hire, retain, and train an acquisition 
        workforce of appropriate size and skill to effectively carry out 
        the acquisition programs of the Federal agencies covered by the 
        plan, including an examination of interagency funding methods 
        and a discussion of how the model of the Defense Acquisition 
        Workforce Development Fund could be applied to civilian 
        agencies.

        retain, and train an acquisition workforce of appropriate size 
        and skill at each Federal agency covered by the plan.

        can use to project future acquisition workforce personnel hiring 
        requirements, including an appropriate distribution of such 
        personnel across each category of positions designated

[[Page 122 STAT. 4554]]

        as acquisition workforce personnel under section 37(j) of the 
        Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 433(j)).

        agencies covered by the plan below 25 percent over the next 5 
        years, an examination of each of the matters specified in 
        paragraphs (1) through (5) in the context of a 5-year plan that 
        increases the size of such acquisition workforce by not less 
        than 25 percent, or an explanation why such a level of growth 
        would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government.

SEC. 1035. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS MANAGEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The unauthorized transfer of nuclear weapons from Minot 
        Air Force Base, North Dakota, to Barksdale Air Force Base, 
        Louisiana, in August 2007 was an extraordinary breach of the 
        command and control and security of nuclear weapons.
            (2) The reviews conducted following that unauthorized 
        transfer found that the ability of the Department of Defense to 
        provide oversight of nuclear weapons matters had degenerated and 
        that senior level attention to nuclear weapons management is 
        minimal at best.
            (3) The lack of attention to nuclear weapons and related 
        equipment by the Department of Defense was demonstrated again 
        when it was discovered in March 2008 that classified equipment 
        from Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles was 
        inadvertently shipped to Taiwan in 2006.
            (4) The Department of Defense has insufficient capability 
        and staffing in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Policy to provide the necessary oversight of the nuclear weapons 
        functions of the Department.
            (5) The key senior position responsible for nuclear weapons 
        matters in the Department of Defense, the Assistant to the 
        Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological 
        Defense Programs, a position filled by appointment by and with 
        the advice and consent of the Senate, was vacant for more than 
        18 months before being filled in July 2008.
            (6) The inability to provide consistent senior level 
        emphasis on nuclear weapons policy has contributed to an erosion 
        in the level of attention paid to nuclear weapons matters across 
        the Department of Defense.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should maintain clear and unambiguous 
        command and control of its nuclear weapons;
            (2) the safety and security of nuclear weapons and related 
        equipment should be a high priority as long as the United States 
        maintains a stockpile of nuclear weapons;
            (3) these objectives will be more successfully attained if 
        greater attention is paid to nuclear weapons matters within the 
        Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the Under 
        Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Office of the Under 
        Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics;
            (4) the Secretary of Defense should consider establishing 
        and filling a senior position, at the level of Assistant 
        Secretary of Defense or Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, 
        within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy 
        to hold

[[Page 122 STAT. 4596]]

        primary responsibility for the strategic and nuclear weapons 
        policy of the Department of Defense; and
            (5) the Secretary of Defense should clarify the lines of 
        responsibility and accountability for nuclear weapons matters 
        within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to place greater 
        emphasis on strategic and nuclear weapons policy and management.
SEC. 1036. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON JOINT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-
                          FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 
                          EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON CONFLICT AND 
                          DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) of the Department of 
        Defense, like the Predator and the Global Hawk, have become a 
        critical component of military operations. Unmanned aerial 
        systems are indispensable in the conflict against terrorism and 
        the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
            (2) Unmanned aerial systems of the Department of Defense 
        must operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) for training, 
        operational support to the combatant commands, and support to 
        domestic authorities in emergencies and national disasters.
            (3) The Department of Defense has been lax in developing 
        certifications of airworthiness for unmanned aerial systems, 
        qualifications for operators of unmanned aerial systems, 
        databases on safety matters relating to unmanned aerial systems, 
        and standards, technology, and procedures that are necessary for 
        routine access of unmanned aerial systems to the National 
        Airspace System.
            (4) As recognized in a Memorandum of Agreement for Operation 
        of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the National Airspace System 
        signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Administrator 
        of the Federal Aviation Administration in September 2007, it is 
        vital for the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation 
        Administration to collaborate closely to achieve progress in 
        gaining access for unmanned aerial systems to the National 
        Airspace System to support military requirements.
            (5) The Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation 
        Administration have jointly and separately taken significant 
        actions to improve the access of unmanned aerial systems of the 
        Department of Defense to the National Airspace System, but 
        overall, the pace of progress in access of such systems to the 
        National Airspace System has been insufficient and poses a 
        threat to national security.
            (6) Techniques and procedures can be rapidly acquired or 
        developed to temporarily permit safe operations of unmanned 
        aerial systems in the National Airspace System until permanent 
        safe operations of such systems in the National Airspace System 
        can be achieved.
            (7) Identifying, developing, approving, implementing, and 
        monitoring the adequacy of these techniques and procedures may 
        require the establishment of a joint Department of Defense-
        Federal Aviation Administration executive committee reporting to 
        the highest levels of the Department of Defense and the Federal 
        Aviation Administration on matters relating

[[Page 122 STAT. 4597]]

        to the access of unmanned aerial systems of the Department of 
        Defense to the National Airspace System.
            (8) Joint management attention at the highest levels of the 
        Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration 
        may also be required on other important issues, such as type 
        ratings for aerial refueling aircraft.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should seek an agreement with the Administrator of 
the Federal Aviation Administration to jointly establish within the 
Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration a joint 
Department of Defense-Federal Aviation Administration executive 
committee on conflict and dispute resolution which would--
            (1) act as a focal point for the resolution of disputes on 
        matters of policy and procedures between the Department of 
        Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration with respect 
        to--
                    (A) airspace, aircraft certifications, and aircrew 
                training; and
                    (B) other issues brought before the joint executive 
                committee by the Department of Defense or the Department 
                of Transportation;
            (2) identify solutions to the range of technical, 
        procedural, and policy concerns arising in the disputes 
        described in paragraph (1); and
            (3) identify solutions to the range of technical, 
        procedural, and policy concerns arising in the integration of 
        Department of Defense unmanned aerial systems into the National 
        Airspace System in order to achieve the increasing, and 
        ultimately routine, access of such systems into the National 
        Airspace System.
SEC. 1037. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SALE OF NEW OUTSIZE CARGO, 
                          STRATEGIC AIRLIFT AIRCRAFT FOR CIVILIAN 
                          USE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and the 2005 
        Mobility Capability Study determined that the United States 
        Transportation Command requires a force of 292 to 383 organic 
        strategic airlift aircraft, augmented by procurement of airlift 
        service from commercial air carriers participating in the Civil 
        Reserve Air Fleet, to meet the demands of the National Military 
        Strategy. Congress has authorized and appropriated funds for 316 
        strategic airlift aircraft.
            (2) The commander of the United States Transportation 
        Command has testified to Congress that it is essential to 
        safeguard the capabilities and capacity of the Civil Reserve Air 
        Fleet to meet wartime surge demands in connection with major 
        combat operations and that procurement by the Air Force of 
        excess organic strategic airlift aircraft could be harmful to 
        the health of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.
            (3) The C-17 aircraft is used extensively by the Air 
        Mobility Command in the Global War on Terror. Production of the 
        C-17 aircraft is scheduled to cease in August, 2010.
            (4) The Federal Aviation Administration has informed 
        Congress that no fewer than six commercial operators have 
        expressed interest in operating a commercial variant of the C-17 
        aircraft. Commercial sale of the new C-17 aircraft would require 
        that the Department of Defense determine that it is

[[Page 122 STAT. 4598]]

        in the national interest for the Federal Aviation Administration 
        to proceed with the issuance of a type certificate for C-17 
        aircraft in accordance with section 21.27 of title 14, Code of 
        Federal Regulations.
            (5) New C-17 aircraft sold for commercial use could be made 
        available to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, thus strengthening the 
        capabilities and capacity of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Transportation, should--
            (1) review the benefits and feasibility of pursuing a new 
        production commercial cargo capability with new C-17 commercial 
        variant aircraft and determine whether such capability is in the 
        national interest; and
            (2) if the Secretary of Defense determines that such a 
        capability is in the national interest, take appropriate actions 
        to coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration to 
        achieve the type certification for a commercial variant of the 
        C-17 required by section 21.27 of title 14, Code of Federal 
        Regulations.

SEC. 1043. STUDY ON ROTORCRAFT SURVIVABILITY.

    (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall carry out a study on Department of 
Defense rotorcraft survivability. The study shall--
            (1) with respect to actual losses of rotorcraft in combat--
                    (A) identify the rates of such losses from 1965 
                through 2008, measured in total annual losses by type of 
                aircraft and by cause, with rates for loss per flight 
                hour and loss per sortie provided;
                    (B) identify by category of hostile action (such as 
                small arms, Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, and so 
                on), the causal factors for the losses; and
                    (C) propose candidate solutions for survivability 
                (such as training, tactics, speed, countermeasures, 
                maneuverability, lethality, technology, and so on), in a 
                prioritized list with explanations, to mitigate each 
                such causal factor, along with recommended funding 
                adequate to achieve rates at least equal to the 
                experience in the Vietnam conflict;
            (2) with respect to actual losses of rotorcraft in combat 
        theater not related to hostile action--
                    (A) identify the causal factors of loss in a ranked 
                list; and
                    (B) propose candidate solutions for survivability 
                (such as training, tactics, speed, countermeasures, 
                maneuverability, lethality, technology, and so on), in a 
                prioritized list, to mitigate each such causal factor, 
                along with recommended funding adequate to achieve the 
                Secretary's Mishap Reduction Initiative goal of not more 
                than 0.5 mishaps per 100,000 flight hours;
            (3) with respect to losses of rotorcraft in training or 
        other non-combat operations during peacetime or interwar years--
                    (A) identify by category (such as inadvertent 
                instrument meteorological conditions, wire strike, and 
                so on) the causal factors of loss in a ranked list; and
                    (B) identify candidate solutions for survivability 
                and performance (such as candidate solutions referred to 
                in paragraph (2)(B) as well as maintenance, logistics, 
                systems development, and so on) in a prioritized list, 
                to mitigate each such causal factor, along with 
                recommended funding adequate to achieve the goal of 
                rotorcraft loss rates to non-combat causes being reduced 
                to 1.0;

[[Page 122 STAT. 4600]]

            (4) identify the key technical factors (causes of mishaps 
        that are not related to human factors) negatively impacting the 
        rotorcraft mishap rates and survivability trends, to include 
        reliability, availability, maintainability, and other logistical 
        considerations; and
            (5) identify what TACAIR is and has done differently to have 
        such a decrease in losses per sortie when compared to 
        rotorcraft, to include--
                    (A) examination of aircraft, aircraft maintenance, 
                logistics, operations, and pilot and operator training;
                    (B) an emphasis on the development of common service 
                requirements that TACAIR has implemented already which 
                are minimizing losses within TACAIR; and
                    (C) candidate solutions, in a prioritized list, to 
                mitigate each causal factor with recommended funding 
                adequate to achieve the goal of rotorcraft loss rates 
                stated above.

    (b) Report.--Not later than August 1, 2009, the Secretary and the 
Chairman shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report 
on the results of the study.
SEC. 1044. REPORT ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) numerous nuclear weapons are held in the arsenals of 
        various countries around the world;
            (2) some of these weapons make attractive targets for theft 
        and for use by terrorist organizations;
            (3) the United States should identify, track, and monitor 
        these weapons as a matter of national security;
            (4) the United States should assess the security risks 
        associated with existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons and 
        should assess the risks of nuclear weapons being developed, 
        acquired, or utilized by other countries, particularly rogue 
        states, and by terrorists and other non-state actors; and
            (5) the United States should work cooperatively with other 
        countries to improve the security of nuclear weapons and to 
        promote multilateral reductions in the numbers of nuclear 
        weapons.

    (b) Review.--The <<NOTE: President.>> President, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Energy, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a 
review of nuclear weapons world-wide that includes--
            (1) an inventory of the nuclear arsenals of all countries 
        that possess, or are believed to possess, nuclear weapons, which 
        indicates, as accurately as possible, the nuclear weapons that 
        are known, or are believed, to exist according to nationality, 
        type, yield, and form of delivery, and an assessment of the 
        methods that are currently employed to identify, track, and 
        monitor nuclear weapons and their component materials;
            (2) an assessment of the risks associated with the 
        deployment, transfer, and storage of nuclear weapons deemed to 
        be attractive to terrorists, rogue states, and other state or 
        non-state actors on account of their size or portability, or on 
        account of their accessibility due to the manner of their 
        deployment or storage; and
            (3) recommendations for--
                    (A) mechanisms and procedures to improve security 
                and safeguards for the nuclear weapons deemed to be

[[Page 122 STAT. 4601]]

                attractive to terrorists, rogue states, and other state 
                or non-state actors;
                    (B) mechanisms and procedures to improve the ability

[[Page 122 STAT. 4653]]

SEC. 1602. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2368 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In June 2004, the Office of the Coordinator for 
        Reconstruction and Stabilization (referred to as the 
        ``Coordinator'') was established in the Department of State with 
        the mandate to lead, coordinate, and institutionalize United 
        States Government civilian capacity to prevent or prepare for 
        post-conflict situations and help reconstruct and stabilize a 
        country or region that is at risk of, in, or is in transition 
        from, conflict or civil strife.
            (2) In December 2005, the Coordinator's mandate was 
        reaffirmed by the National Security Presidential Directive 44, 
        which instructed the Secretary of State, and at the Secretary's 
        direction, the Coordinator, to coordinate and lead integrated 
        United States Government efforts, involving all United States 
        departments and agencies with relevant capabilities, to prepare, 
        plan for, and conduct reconstruction and stabilization 
        operations.
            (3) National Security Presidential Directive 44 assigns to 
        the Secretary, with the Coordinator's assistance, the lead role 
        to develop reconstruction and stabilization strategies, ensure 
        civilian interagency program and policy coordination, coordinate 
        interagency processes to identify countries at risk of 
        instability, provide decision-makers with detailed options for 
        an integrated United States Government response in connection 
        with reconstruction and stabilization operations, and carry out 
        a wide range of other actions, including the development of a 
        civilian surge capacity to meet reconstruction and stabilization 
        emergencies. The Secretary and the Coordinator are also charged 
        with coordinating with the Department of Defense on 
        reconstruction and stabilization responses, and integrating 
        planning and implementing procedures.
            (4) The Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.05, 
        which establishes that stability operations are a core United 
        States military mission that the Department of Defense must be 
        prepared to conduct and support, provides guidance on stability 
        operations that will evolve over time, and assigns 
        responsibilities within the Department of Defense for planning, 
        training, and preparing to conduct and support stability 
        operations.
            (5) The President's Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request to 
        Congress includes $248.6 million for a Civilian Stabilization 
        Initiative that would vastly improve civilian partnership with 
        United States Armed Forces in post-conflict stabilization 
        situations, including by establishing a Active Response Corps of 
        250 persons, a Standby Response Corps of 2,000 persons, and a 
        Civilian Response Corps of 2,000 persons.

            (1) Military personnel and their families, as well as 
        veterans and retired military personnel living in the National 
        Capital region, deserve to be treated in world class medical 
        facilities.
            (2) World class medical facilities are defined as 
        incorporating the best practices of the premier private health 
        facilities in the country as well as the collaborative input of 
        military health care professionals into a design that supports 
        the unique needs of military personnel and their families.
            (3) The closure of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 
        Washington, D.C., and the resulting construction of the National 
        Military Medical Center at the National Naval Medical Center, 
        Bethesda, Maryland, and a new military hospital at Fort Belvoir, 
        Virginia, offer the Department of Defense the opportunity to 
        provide state-of-the-art and world-class medical facilities 
        offering the highest quality of joint service care for members 
        of the Armed Forces and their families.
            (4) Congress has supported a Department of Defense request 
        to expedite the construction of the new facilities at Bethesda 
        and Fort Belvoir in order to provide care in better facilities 
        as quickly as possible.
            (5) The Department of Defense has a responsibility to ensure 
        that the expedited design and construction of such facilities do 
        not result in degradation of the quality standards required for 
        world class facilities.

    (b) Independent Design Review.--
            (1) Establishment of design review panel.--The Secretary of 
        Defense shall establish a panel consisting of medical facility 
        design experts, military healthcare professionals, 
        representatives of premier health care facilities in the United 
        States, and patient representatives--
                    (A) to review design plans for the National Military 
                Medical Center and the new military hospital at Fort 
                Belvoir; and

[[Page 122 STAT. 4717]]

                    (B) to advise the Secretary regarding whether the 
                design, in the view of the panel, will achieve the goal 
                of providing world-class medical facilities; and
            (2) Recommendations for changes to design plan.--If the 
        panel determines that the design plans will not meet such goal, 
        the panel shall make recommendations for changes to those plans 
        to ensure the construction of world-class medical facilities.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the panel shall submit to the Secretary 
        of Defense a report on the findings and recommendations of the 
        panel to address any deficiencies in the conceptual design 
        plans.
            (4) Assessment of recommendations.--
        Not <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>>  later than 30 days after 
        submission of the report under paragraph (3), the Secretary of 
        Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a

                    (B) the plans of the Secretary for addressing such 
                findings and recommendations.

    (c) Cost Estimate.--
            (1) Preparation.--The Department of Defense shall prepare a 
        cost estimate of the total cost to be incurred by the United 
        States to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center, design and 
        construct replacement facilities at the National Naval Medical
