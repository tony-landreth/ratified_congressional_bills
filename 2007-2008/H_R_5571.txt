    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) Federal programs waiving the 2-year foreign residence 
        requirement under section 212(e) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(e)) for physicians are generally 
        designed to promote the delivery of critically needed medical 
        services to people in the United States lacking adequate access 
        to physician care; and
            (2) when determining the qualification of a location for 
        designation as a health professional shortage area, the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services should consider the needs 
        of vulnerable populations in low-income and impoverished 
        communities, communities with high infant mortality rates,

        and communities exhibiting other signs of a lack of necessary 
        physician services.

    Approved October 8, 2008.
