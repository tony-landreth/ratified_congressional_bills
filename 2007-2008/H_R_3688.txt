                apparel good containing elastomeric yarns in the 
                component of the good that determines the tariff 
                classification of the good shall be considered to be an 
                originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in 
                the territory of Peru, the United States, or both.
                    (C) Yarn, fabric, or fiber.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, in the case of a good that is a yarn, fabric,

                material is an originating good may base the claim 
                either on the physical segregation of the fungible good 
                or fungible material or by using an inventory management 
                method with respect to the fungible good or fungible 
                material.
                    (B) Inventory management method.--In this

                                States); or
                                    (II) otherwise accepted by that 
                                country.
            (2) Election of inventory method.--A person selecting an 
        inventory management method under paragraph (1) for a particular 
        fungible good or fungible material shall continue to use that

                nonoriginating materials used in the production of the 
                good undergo the applicable change in tariff 
                classification set forth in Annex 4.1 of the Agreement.
            (2) Conditions.--Paragraph (1) shall apply only if--
                    (A) the accessories, spare parts, or tools are 
                classified with and not invoiced separately from the 
                good, regardless of whether such accessories, spare 
                parts, or tools are specified or are separately 
                identified in the invoice for the good; and
                    (B) the quantities and value of the accessories,

            (3) Regional value-content.--If the good is subject to a 
        regional value-content requirement, the value of the 
        accessories, spare parts, or tools shall be taken into account 
        as originating or nonoriginating materials, as the case may be, 
        in calculating the regional value-content of the good.

    (i) Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale.--Packaging 
materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale, if 
classified with the good, shall be disregarded in determining whether 
all the nonoriginating materials used in the production of the good 
undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set forth in 
Annex 3-A or Annex 4.1 of the Agreement, and, if the good is subject to 
a regional value-content requirement, the value of such packaging 
materials and containers shall be taken into account as originating or 
nonoriginating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the 
regional value-content of the good.

        outside the territory of Peru or the United States, other than

    (a) Determination.--
            (1) In general.--If a positive determination is made under 
        section 321(b), the President shall determine whether, as a 
        result of the elimination of a duty under the Agreement, a 
        Peruvian textile or apparel article is being imported into the 
        United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or 
        relative to the domestic market for that article, and under such 
        conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, 
        to a domestic industry producing an article that is like, or 
        directly competitive with, the imported article.
            (2) Serious damage.--In making a determination under 
        paragraph (1), the President--
                    (A) shall examine the effect of increased imports on 
                the domestic industry, as reflected in changes in such 
                relevant economic factors as output, productivity, 
                utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, 
                exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and 
                losses, and investment, no one of which is necessarily 
                decisive; and
                    (B) shall not consider changes in consumer 
                preference or changes in technology in the United States 
                as factors supporting a determination of serious damage 
                or actual threat thereof.

    (b) Provision of Relief.--
            (1) In general.--If a determination under subsection (a) is 
        affirmative, the President may provide relief from imports of 
        the article that is the subject of such determination, as 
        provided in paragraph (2), to the extent that the President 
        determines necessary to remedy or prevent the serious damage and 
        to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry.
            (2) Nature of relief.--The relief that the President is 
        authorized to provide under this subsection with respect to 
        imports of an article is an increase in the rate of duty imposed 
        on the article to a level that does not exceed the lesser of--
                    (A) the column 1 general rate of duty imposed under 
                the HTS on like articles at the time the import relief 
                is provided; or

        President determines that--
                    (A) the import relief continues to be necessary to 
                remedy or prevent serious damage and to facilitate 
                adjustment by the domestic industry to import 
                competition; and
                    (B) there is evidence that the industry is making a 
                positive adjustment to import competition.
            (2) Limitation.--Any relief provided under this subtitle,
