Public Law 110-325
110th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To restore the intent and protections of the Americans with Disabilities 
           Act of 1990. <<NOTE: Sept. 25, 2008 -  [S. 3406]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: ADA Amendments Act of 
2008. 42 USC 12101 note.>> assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``ADA Amendments Act of 2008''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 12101 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
        (ADA), Congress intended that the Act ``provide a clear and 
        comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of 
        discrimination against individuals with disabilities'' and 
        provide broad coverage;
            (2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that physical 
        and mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right to 
        fully participate in all aspects of society, but that people 
        with physical or mental disabilities are frequently precluded 
        from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the 
        failure to remove societal and institutional barriers;
            (3) while Congress expected that the definition of 
        disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently with 
        how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped 
        individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that 
        expectation has not been fulfilled;
            (4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United 
        Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases 
        have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be 
        afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many 
        individuals whom Congress intended to protect;
            (5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor 
        Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) 
        further narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be 
        afforded by the ADA;
            (6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts 
        have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a 
        range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with 
        disabilities;
            (7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota 
        Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 
        (2002), interpreted the term ``substantially limits'' to require 
        a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress; 
        and

[[Page 122 STAT. 3554]]

            (8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment 
        Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term 
        ``substantially limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' are 
        inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a 
        standard.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing ``a clear 
        and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of 
        discrimination'' and ``clear, strong, consistent, enforceable 
        standards addressing discrimination'' by reinstating a broad 
        scope of protection to be available under the ADA;
            (2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme 
        Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) 
        and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially 
        limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference 
        to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures;
            (3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. 
        United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to 
        coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability 
        and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School 
        Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set 
        forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of 
        handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;
            (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court 
        in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 
        U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms ``substantially'' and ``major'' 
        in the definition of disability under the ADA ``need to be 
        interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for 
        qualifying as disabled,'' and that to be substantially limited 
        in performing a major life activity under the ADA ``an 
        individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely 
        restricts the individual from doing activities that are of 
        central importance to most people's daily lives'';
            (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created 
        by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, 
        Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for 
        ``substantially limits'', and applied by lower courts in 
        numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of 
        limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey 
        that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of 
        attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether 
        entities covered under the ADA have complied with their 
        obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an 
        individual's impairment is a disability under the ADA should not 
        demand extensive analysis; and
            (6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal 
        Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of 
        its current regulations that defines the term ``substantially 
        limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' to be consistent with 
        this Act, including the amendments made by this Act.
SEC. 3. CODIFIED FINDINGS.

    Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. 12101) is amended--
            (1) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:
            ``(1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a 
        person's right to fully participate in all aspects of society,

[[Page 122 STAT. 3555]]

        yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been 
        precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who 
        have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a 
        disability also have been subjected to discrimination;'';
            (2) by striking paragraph (7); and
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (8) and (9) as paragraphs 
        (7) and (8), respectively.
SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

    (a) Definition of Disability.--Section 3 of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to read as 
follows:
``SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF DISABILITY.

                substantially limits one or more major life activities 
                of such individual;
                    ``(B) a record of such an impairment; or
                    ``(C) being regarded as having such an impairment 
                (as described in paragraph (3)).
            ``(2) Major life activities.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1),

                    ``(B) Major bodily functions.--For purposes of 
                paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the 
                operation of a major bodily function, including but not 
                limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell 
                growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, 
                respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive 
                functions.
            ``(3) Regarded as having such an impairment.--For purposes 
        of paragraph (1)(C):
                    ``(A) An individual meets the requirement of `being 
                regarded as having such an impairment' if the individual 
                establishes that he or she has been subjected to an 
                action prohibited under this Act because of an actual or 
                perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not 
                the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major 
                life activity.
                    ``(B) Paragraph (1)(C) shall not apply to 
                impairments that are transitory and minor. A transitory 
                impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected 
                duration of 6 months or less.
            ``(4) Rules of construction regarding the definition of 
        disability.--The definition of `disability' in paragraph (1) 
        shall be construed in accordance with the following:
                    ``(A) The definition of disability in this Act shall 
                be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals 
                under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the 
                terms of this Act.
                    ``(B) The term `substantially limits' shall be 
                interpreted consistently with the findings and purposes 
                of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.

                    ``(C) An impairment that substantially limits one 
                major life activity need not limit other major life 
                activities in order to be considered a disability.
                    ``(D) An impairment that is episodic or in remission 
                is a disability if it would substantially limit a major 
                life activity when active.

                substantially limits a major life activity shall be made
