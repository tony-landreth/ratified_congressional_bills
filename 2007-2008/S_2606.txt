      UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008

[[Page 122 STAT. 4056]]

Public Law 110-376
110th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To reauthorize the United States Fire Administration, and for other 
             purposes. <<NOTE: Oct. 8, 2008 -  [S. 2606]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: United States 
Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008.>> assembled,
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``United States Fire 
Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2201 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has 
        dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United 
        States. However, the United States still has one of the highest 
        fire death rates in the industrialized world. In 2006, the 
        National Fire Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian 
        fire deaths, 16,400 civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 
        in direct losses due to fire.
            (2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line 
        of duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue 
        its leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce 
        these fatalities.
            (3) The Federal Government should continue to work with 
        State and local governments and the fire service community to 
        further the promotion of national voluntary consensus standards 
        that increase firefighter safety.
            (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial 
        support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States 
        through training, emergency incident data collection, fire 
        awareness and education, and support of research and development 
        activities for fire prevention, control, and suppression 
        technologies.
            (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency 
        incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency 
        responders to identify and develop responses to emerging 
        hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities of the 
        United States Fire Administration is essential for accurately 
        tracking and responding to the magnitude and nature of the fire 
        problems of the United States.
            (6) The research and development performed by the National 
        Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire 
        Administration, other government agencies, and nongovernmental 
        organizations on fire technologies, techniques, and tools 
        advance the capabilities of the fire service of the United 
        States to suppress and prevent fires.

[[Page 122 STAT. 4057]]

            (7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire 
        Administration and the fire service community in preparing for 
        and responding to national and man-made disasters, the United 
        States Fire Administration should have a prominent place within 
        the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of 
        Homeland Security.
