            (5) GAO study on volunteer enhancement.--
                    (A) In general.--
                Not <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>> later than 6 months 
                after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller 
                General of the United States shall conduct a study, and 
                submit a report to Congress, concerning the implications 
                of extending Federal Tort Claims Act (chapter 171 of 
                title

[[Page 122 STAT. 3992]]

                28, United States Code) coverage to health care 
                professionals who volunteer to furnish care to patients 
                of health centers.
                    (B) Content.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United 
                States shall analyze--
                          (i) the potential financial implications for 
                      the Federal Government of such an extension, 
                      including any increased funding needed for current 
                      health center Federal Tort Claims Act coverage;
                          (ii) an estimate of the increase in the number 
                      of health care professionals at health centers, 
                      and what types of such professionals would most 
                      likely volunteer given the extension of Federal 
                      Tort Claims Act coverage;
                          (iii) the increase in services provided by 
                      health centers as a result of such an increase in 
                      health care professionals, and in particular the 
                      effect of such action on the ability of health 
                      centers to secure specialty and diagnostic 
                      services needed by their uninsured and other 
                      patients;
                          (iv) the volume of patient workload at health 
                      centers and how volunteer health care 
                      professionals may help address the patient volume;
                          (v) the most appropriate manner of extending 
                      such coverage to volunteer health care 
                      professionals at health centers, including any 
                      potential difference from the mechanism currently 
                      used for health care professional volunteers at 
                      free clinics;
                          (vi) State laws that have been shown to 
                      encourage physicians and other health care 
                      providers to provide charity care as an agent of 
                      the State; and
                          (vii) other policies, including legislative or 
                      regulatory changes, that have the potential to 
                      increase the number of volunteer health care staff 
                      at health centers and the financial implications 
                      of such policies, including the cost savings 
                      associated with the ability to provide more 
                      services in health centers rather than more 
                      expensive sites of care.

    (c) Recognition of High Poverty.--
            (1) In general.--Section 330(c) of the Public Health Service 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(c)) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following new paragraph:
            ``(3) Recognition of high poverty.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In making grants under this 
                subsection, the Secretary may recognize the unique needs 
                of high poverty areas.
                    ``(B) High poverty area defined.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), the term `high poverty area' means a 
                catchment area which is established in a manner that is 
                consistent with the factors in subsection (k)(3)(J), and 
                the poverty rate of which is greater than the national 
                average poverty rate as determined by the Bureau of the 
                Census.''.
            (2) Effective <<NOTE: 42 USC 254b note.>> date.--The 
        amendment made by paragraph (1) shall apply to grants made on or 
        after January 1, 2009.
