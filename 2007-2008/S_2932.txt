Public Law 110-377
110th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize the poison center 
national toll-free number, national media campaign, and grant program to 
provide assistance for poison prevention, sustain the funding of poison 
     centers, and enhance the public health of people of the United 
              States. <<NOTE: Oct. 8, 2008 -  [S. 2932]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Poison Center Support, 
Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008.>> assembled,
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Center Support, Enhancement, 
and Awareness Act of 2008''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 300d-71 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Poison control centers are the primary defense of the 
        United States against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-
        four hours a day, the general public as well as health care 
        practitioners contact their local poison control centers for 
        help in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In 2007, 
        more than 4,000,000 calls were managed by poison control centers 
        providing ready and direct access for all people of the United 
        States, including many underserved populations in the United 
        States, with vital emergency public health information and 
        response.
            (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of 
        unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, 
        there will be between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 poison exposures. 
        Sixty percent of these exposures will involve children under the 
        age of 6 who are exposed to toxins in their home. Poisoning 
        accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute 
        hospital care, and more than 26,000 fatalities in 2005.
            (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center 
        reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown 
        circumstances more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, the 
        last year for which data are available, 26,858 people died from 
        accidental or unknown poisonings. This represents an increase of 
        20,000 since 1990 and an increase of 2,400 between 2004 and 
        2005. Fatalities from poisoning are increasing in the United 
        States in near epidemic proportions. The funding of programs to 
        reverse this trend is needed now more than ever.
            (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine of the National 
        Academy of Sciences recommended that ``Congress should amend the 
        current Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act 
        Amendments of 2003 to provide sufficient

[[Page 122 STAT. 4064]]

        funding to support the proposed Poison Prevention and Control 
        System with its national network of poison centers. Support for 
        the core activities at the current level of service is estimated 
        to require more than $100 million annually.''.
            (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing 
        accessibility to poison control centers will promote the 
        utilization of poison control centers and reduce the 
        inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more 
        costly health care services. The 2004 Institute of Medicine 
        Report to Congress determined that for every $1 invested in the 
        Nation's poison control centers $7 of health care costs are 
        saved. In 2005, direct Federal health care program savings 
        totaled in excess of $525,000,000 as the result of poison 
        control center public health services.
            (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial 
        benefits of the Nation's network of poison control centers are 
        realized annually by Federal health care programs (estimated to 
        be more than $1,000,000,000), yet Federal funding support (as 
        demonstrated by the annual authorization of $30,100,000 in 
        Public Law 108-194) comprises less than 11 percent of the annual 
        network expenditures of poison centers.
            (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified 
        poison control centers can be an important source of information 
        for the detection, monitoring, and response for contamination of 
        the air, water, pharmaceutical, or food supply.
            (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison control 
        centers will be relied upon as a critical source for accurate 
        medical information and public health emergency response 
        concerning the treatment of patients who have had an exposure to 
        a chemical, radiological, or biological agent.
