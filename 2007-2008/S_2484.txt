    (a) Findings.--Congress <<NOTE: 42 USC 285g note.>> makes the 
following findings:
            (1) Since it was established by Congress in 1962 at the 
        request of President John F. Kennedy, the National Institute of 
        Child Health and Human Development has achieved an outstanding 
        record of achievement in catalyzing a concentrated attack on the 
        unsolved health problems of children and of mother-infant 
        relationships by fulfilling its mission to--
                    (A) ensure that every individual is born healthy and 
                wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from 
                reproductive processes, and that all children have the 
                chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and 
                productive lives, free from disease or disability; and
                    (B) ensure the health, productivity, independence, 
                and well-being of all individuals through optimal 
                rehabilitation.
            (2) The National Institute of Child Health and Human 
        Development has made unparalleled contributions to the 
        advancement of child health and human development, including 
        significant efforts to--
                    (A) reduce dramatically the rates of Sudden Infant 
                Death Syndrome, infant mortality, and maternal HIV 
                transmission;
                    (B) develop the Haemophilus Influenza B (Hib) 
                vaccine, credited with nearly eliminating the incidence 
                of mental retardation; and
                    (C) conduct intramural research, support extramural 
                research, and train thousands of child health and human 
                development researchers who have contributed greatly to 
                dramatic gains in child health throughout the world.
            (3) The vision, drive, and tenacity of one woman, Eunice 
        Kennedy Shriver, was instrumental in proposing, passing, and 
        enacting legislation to establish the National Institute of 
        Child Health and Human Development (Public Law 87-838) on 
        October 17, 1962.
            (4) It is befitting and appropriate to recognize the 
        substantial achievements of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a tireless 
        advocate for children with special needs, whose foresight in 
        creating
