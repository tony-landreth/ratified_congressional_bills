    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Navy SEALs are the most elite fighting 
        force in the world and bravely serve in combat operations around 
        the World.
            (2) The Navy SEALs trace their roots from the Navy Frogmen 
        of World War II.
            (3) The location recognized as the birthplace of the Navy 
        Frogmen, where thousands of brave volunteers were trained as 
        members of Naval Combat Demolition Units and Underwater 
        Demolition Teams during World War II, is now home to the Navy 
        UDT-SEAL Museum.
            (4) The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum is the only museum dedicated 
        solely to preserving the history of the Navy SEALs and its 
        predecessors, including the Underwater Demolition Teams, Naval 
        Combat Demolition Units, Office of Strategic Services Maritime 
        Units, and Amphibious Scouts and Raiders.
            (5) The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum preserves the legacy of the 
        honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifices of those Navy SEALs 
        and their predecessors who offered their services and who gave 
        their lives in defense of liberty.
            (6) The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum finances, operations, and 
        collections are managed by UDT-SEAL Museum Association, Inc., a 
        nonprofit organization governed by current and former SEALs and 
        UDTs.
            (7) The Navy UDT-SEAL Museum seeks to educate a diverse 
        group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of 
        historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the 
        participants on the battlefield and the home front and the 
        impact of Navy SEALs and their predecessors, then and now.
            (8) Since 1985, when the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum first opened, 
        it has become home to artifacts and photos telling the history 
        of Naval Special Warfare from the beginnings of Underwater 
        Demolition training in Ft. Pierce, Florida, through the exploits 
        of Navy Frogmen in the Atlantic and Pacific war theaters of 
        World War II, through the role of Navy SEALs in fighting in the 
        War on Terror and in Iraq.
