  To ensure the fair treatment of a member of the Armed Forces who is

 result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in 
action status, or is permanently disabled, to amend the Internal Revenue

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    (a) Effect of Sole Survivorship Discharge.--Section 303a(e) of title 
37, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``A member'' and inserting 
        ``(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a member'';
            (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as subparagraph (B) of 
        paragraph (1); and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1), as so amended, the 
        following new paragraph (2):

    ``(2)(A) If a member of the uniformed services receives a sole 
survivorship discharge, the Secretary concerned--

[[Page 121 STAT. 3527]]

            ``(i) shall not require repayment by the member of the 
        unearned portion of any bonus, incentive pay, or similar benefit 
        previously paid to the member; and
            ``(ii) may grant an exception to the requirement to 
        terminate the payment of any unpaid amounts of a bonus, 
        incentive pay, or similar benefit if the Secretary concerned 
        determines that termination of the payment of the unpaid amounts 
        would be contrary to a personnel policy or management objective, 
        would be against equity and good conscience, or would be 
        contrary to the best interests of the United States.

    ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `sole survivorship discharge' 
means the separation of a member from the Armed Forces, at the request 
of the member, pursuant to the Department of Defense policy permitting 
the early separation of a member who is the only surviving child in a 
family in which--
            ``(i) the father or mother or one or more siblings--
                    ``(I) served in the Armed Forces; and
                    ``(II) was killed, died as a result of wounds, 
                accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in 
                action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or 
                hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed 
                gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization); 
                and
            ``(ii) the death, status, or disability did not result from 
        the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or 
        sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized 
        absence.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the extraordinary discretion 
granted to the Secretary of a military department by statute and policy 
to continue to pay the unpaid amounts of a bonus, incentive pay, or 
similar benefit otherwise due to a member of the Armed Forces under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary who receives a sole survivorship 
discharge, it is the sense of Congress that the Secretaries of the 
military departments should aggressively use such discretion to the 
benefit of members receiving a sole survivorship discharge.

                    FORCES WITH LESS THAN SIX YEARS OF ACTIVE

                accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in
