Public Law 110-78
110th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To waive application of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act to a specific parcel of real property transferred by the 
 United States to 2 Indian tribes in the State of Oregon, and for other 
             purposes. <<NOTE: Aug. 13, 2007 -  [S. 375]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    With respect to the parcel of real property in Marion County, 
Oregon, deeded by the United States to the Confederated Tribes of Siletz 
Indians of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde 
Community of Oregon by quitclaim deed dated June 18, 2002, and recorded 
in the public records of Marion County on June 19, 2002, Congress finds 
that--
            (1) the parcel of land described in the quitclaim deed, 
        comprising approximately 19.86 acres of land originally used as 
        part of the Chemawa Indian School, was transferred by the United 
        States in 1973 and 1974 to the State of Oregon for use for 
        highway and associated road projects;
            (2) Interstate Route 5 and the Salem Parkway were completed, 
        and in 1988 the Oregon Department of Transportation deeded the 
        remaining acreage of the parcel back to the United States;
            (3) the United States could no longer use the returned 
        acreage for the administration of Indian affairs, and determined 
        it would be most appropriate to transfer the property to the 
        Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the 
        Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon;
            (4) on request of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians 
        of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde 
        Community of Oregon, the United States transferred the parcel 
        jointly to the Tribes for economic development and other 
        purposes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.);
            (5) the transfer of the parcel was memorialized by the 
        United States in 2 documents, including--
                    (A) an agreement titled ``Agreement for Transfer of 
                Federally Owned Buildings, Improvements, Facilities and/
                or Land from the United States of America the [sic] 
                Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of 
                Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Tribe [sic] 
                of Oregon'', dated June 21, 2001; and
                    (B) a quitclaim deed dated June 18, 2002, and 
                recorded in the public records of Marion County, Oregon, 
                on June 19, 2002 (reel 1959, page 84);

[[Page 121 STAT. 728]]

            (6) use of the parcel by Tribes for economic development 
        purposes is consistent with the intent and language of the 
        Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 
        U.S.C. 450 et seq.) and other Federal Indian law--
                    (A) to encourage tribal economic development; and
                    (B) to promote economic self-sufficiency for Indian 
                tribes;
            (7) the United States does not desire the return of the 
        parcel and does not intend under any circumstances to take 
        action under the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) or any other legal 
        authority to seek the return of the parcel; and
            (8) in reliance on this intent, the Tribes have committed 
        over $2,500,000 to infrastructure improvements to the parcel, 
        including roads and sewer and water systems, and have approved 
        plans to further develop the parcel for economic purposes, the 
        realization of which is dependent on the ability of the Tribes 
        to secure conventional financing.
SEC. 2. WAIVER OF APPLICATION OF INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION AND 
                    EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT.

    (a) Nonapplication of Law.--Notwithstanding any other provision of

the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Oregon and the Confederated

June 18, 2002, and recorded in the public records of Marion County on 
June 19, 2002.
    (b) New Deed.--The Secretary of the Interior shall issue a new deed 
to the Tribes to the parcel described in subsection (a) that shall not

        seq.).
