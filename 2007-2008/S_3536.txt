SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Air Carriage of International Mail 
Act''.

SEC. 2. AIR CARRIAGE OF INTERNATIONAL MAIL.

    (a) Contracting Authority.--Section 5402 of title 39, United States 
Code, is amended by striking subsections (b) and (c) and inserting the 
following:
    ``(b) International Mail.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Except as otherwise provided in this 
                subsection, the Postal Service may contract for the 
                transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the 
                points in foreign air transportation only with 
                certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to 
                a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air 
                between any of the points in foreign air transportation 
                that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the 
                carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share 
                relationship with one or more foreign air carriers.
                    ``(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or 
                proposals from certificated air carriers to transport 
                mail in foreign air transportation between points, or 
                pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, 
                and has not received offers or proposals that meet 
                Postal Service requirements at a fair and reasonable 
                price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal Service 
                may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. 
                Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the 
                Postal Service's requirements is unavailable at a fair 
                and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air 
                carriers, either directly or through a code-share 
                relationship with one or more foreign air carriers, the 
                Postal Service may contract with foreign air carriers to 
                provide the service sought if, when the Postal Service 
                seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it 
                also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service 
                from any certificated air carrier providing service 
                between those points, or pairs of points within a 
                geographic region or regions,

[[Page 122 STAT. 4288]]

                on the same terms and conditions that are being sought 
                from foreign air carriers.
                    ``(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal 
                Service shall use a methodology for determining fair and 
                reasonable prices for the Postal Service designated 
                region or regions developed in consultation with, and 
                with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers 
                representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles 
                in the markets of interest.
                    ``(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling 
                prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under 
                subparagraph (C) shall be presumed to be fair and 
                reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices 
                derived from--
                          ``(i) a weighted average based on market rate 
                      data furnished by the International Air Transport 
                      Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or
                          ``(ii) if such data are not available from 
                      those sources, such other neutral, regularly 
                      updated set of weighted average market rates as 
                      the Postal Service, with the concurrence of 
                      certificated air carriers representing at least 51 
                      percent of available ton miles in the markets of 
                      interest, may designate.
                    ``(E) If, for purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), 
                concurrence cannot be attained, then the most recently 
                available market rate data described in this 
                subparagraph shall continue to apply for the relevant 
                market or markets.
            ``(2) Contract process.--The Postal Service shall contract 
        for foreign air transportation as set forth in paragraph (1) 
        through an open procurement process that will provide--
                    ``(A) potential offerors with timely notice of 
                business opportunities in sufficient detail to allow 
                them to make a proposal;

                and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and
                    ``(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to 
                receive prompt feedback upon request.
            ``(3) Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift 
        space.--The Postal Service may enter into contracts to transport 
        mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated 
        air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the 
        requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) if--
                    ``(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist 
                that make it impractical for the Postal Service to 
                comply with such requirements; or

                available to it under existing contracts and--
                          ``(i) there is insufficient time available to 
                      seek additional lift using procedures that comply 
                      with those requirements without compromising the 
                      Postal Service's service commitments to its own 
                      customers; and
                          ``(ii) the Postal Service first offers any 
                      certificated air carrier holding a contract to 
                      carry mail between the relevant points the 
                      opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the 
                      terms of its existing contract.

    ``(c) Good Faith Effort Required.--The Postal Service and potential 
offerors shall put a good-faith effort into resolving disputes 
concerning the award of contracts made under subsection (b).''.
