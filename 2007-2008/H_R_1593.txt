SEC. 3. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17501.>> PURPOSES; FINDINGS.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of the Act are--
            (1) to break the cycle of criminal recidivism, increase 
        public safety, and help States, local units of government, and 
        Indian Tribes, better address the growing population of criminal 
        offenders who return to their communities and commit new crimes;
            (2) to rebuild ties between offenders and their families, 
        while the offenders are incarcerated and after reentry into the 
        community, to promote stable families and communities;
            (3) to encourage the development and support of, and to 
        expand the availability of, evidence-based programs that enhance 
        public safety and reduce recidivism, such as substance abuse 
        treatment, alternatives to incarceration, and comprehensive 
        reentry services;
            (4) to protect the public and promote law-abiding conduct by 
        providing necessary services to offenders, while the offenders 
        are incarcerated and after reentry into the community, in a 
        manner that does not confer luxuries or privileges upon such 
        offenders;
            (5) to assist offenders reentering the community from 
        incarceration to establish a self-sustaining and law-abiding 
        life by providing sufficient transitional services for as short 
        of a period as practicable, not to exceed one year, unless a 
        longer period is specifically determined to be necessary by a 
        medical or other appropriate treatment professional; and
            (6) to provide offenders in prisons, jails or juvenile 
        facilities with educational, literacy, vocational, and job 
        placement services to facilitate re-entry into the community.

    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2002, over 7,000,000 people were incarcerated in 
        Federal or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000 
        people are released from Federal and State incarceration into 
        communities nationwide each year.
            (2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United States, 
        the vast majority of which are operated by county governments. 
        Each year, these jails will release more than 10,000,000 people 
        back into the community.

[[Page 122 STAT. 659]]

            (3) Recent studies indicate that over \2/3\ of released 
        State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a felony or 
        serious misdemeanor within 3 years after release.
            (4) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 
        expenditures on corrections alone increased from $9,000,000,000 
        in 1982, to $59,600,000,000 in 2002. These figures do not 
        include the cost of arrest and prosecution, nor do they take 
        into account the cost to victims.
            (5) The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative 
        (SVORI) provided $139,000,000 in funding for State governments 
        to develop and implement education, job training, mental health 
        treatment, and substance abuse treatment for serious and violent 
        offenders. This Act seeks to build upon the innovative and 
        successful State reentry programs developed under the SVORI, 
        which terminated after fiscal year 2005.
            (6) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a 
        parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by 
        more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to 
        approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons, 
        there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected to 
        their children and families are more likely to avoid negative 
        incidents and have reduced sentences.
            (7) Released prisoners cite family support as the most 
        important factor in helping them stay out of prison. Research 
        suggests that families are an often underutilized resource in 
        the reentry process.
            (8) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 years and 
        under) leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison, or 
        Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from secure 
        confinement still have their likely prime crime years ahead of 
        them. Juveniles released from secure confinement have a 
        recidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances that 
        young people will successfully transition into society improve 
        with effective reentry and aftercare programs.
            (9) Studies have shown that between 15 percent and 27 
        percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon 
        release from prison.
            (10) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State 
        inmates used drugs regularly before going to prison, and the 
        Bureau of Justice statistics report titled ``Trends in State 
        Parole, 1990-2000'' estimates the use of drugs or alcohol around 
        the time of the offense that resulted in the incarceration of 
        the inmate at as high as 84 percent.
            (11) Family-based treatment programs have proven results for 
        serving the special populations of female offenders and 
        substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the Substance 
        Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of family-based 
        treatment for substance-abusing mothers and children found that 
        6 months after such treatment, 60 percent of the mothers 
        remained alcohol and drug free, and drug-related offenses 
        declined from 28 percent to 7 percent. Additionally, a 2003 
        evaluation of residential family-based treatment programs 
        revealed that 60 percent of mothers remained clean and sober 6 
        months after treatment, criminal arrests declined by 43 percent, 
        and 88 percent of the children treated in the program with their 
        mothers remained stabilized.

[[Page 122 STAT. 660]]

            (12) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that 
        only 33 percent of Federal inmates and 36 percent of State 
        inmates had participated in residential in-patient treatment 
        programs for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their 
        release. Further, over one-third of all jail inmates have some 
        physical or mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates 
        have been treated at some time for a mental or emotional 
        problem.
            (13) State Substance Abuse Agency Directors, also known as 
        Single State Authorities, manage the publicly funded substance 
        abuse prevention and treatment system of the Nation. Single 
        State Authorities are responsible for planning and implementing 
        statewide systems of care that provide clinically appropriate 
        substance abuse services. Given the high rate of substance use 
        disorders among offenders reentering our communities, successful 
        reentry programs require close interaction and collaboration 
        with each Single State Authority as the program is planned, 
        implemented, and evaluated.
            (14) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70 
        percent of all prisoners function at the lowest literacy levels.
            (15) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a 
        high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared to 
        82 percent of the general population.
            (16) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11 
        years or less of school were not working before entry into 
        prison.
            (17) The percentage of State prisoners participating in 
        educational programs decreased by more than 8 percent between 
        1991 and 1997, despite growing evidence of how educational 
        programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.
            (18) The National Institute of Justice has found that 1 year 
        after release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are not 
        employed.
            (19) Transitional jobs programs have proven to help people 
        with criminal records to successfully return to the workplace 
        and to the community, and therefore can reduce recidivism.

              CHAPTER 1--IMPROVING FEDERAL OFFENDER REENTRY

SEC. 231. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17541.>>  FEDERAL PRISONER REENTRY 
                        INITIATIVE.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General, in coordination with the 
Director of the Bureau of Prisons, shall, subject to the availability of 
appropriations, conduct the following activities to establish a Federal 
prisoner reentry initiative:
            (1) The establishment of a Federal prisoner reentry strategy 
        to help prepare prisoners for release and successful 
        reintegration into the community, including, at a minimum, that 
        the Bureau of Prisons--

[[Page 122 STAT. 684]]

                    (A) assess each prisoner's skill level (including 
                academic, vocational, health, cognitive, interpersonal, 
                daily living, and related reentry skills) at the 
                beginning of the term of imprisonment of that prisoner 
                to identify any areas in need of improvement prior to 
                reentry;
                    (B) generate a skills development plan for each 
                prisoner to monitor skills enhancement and reentry 
                readiness throughout incarceration;
                    (C) determine program assignments for prisoners 
                based on the areas of need identified through the 
                assessment described in subparagraph (A);
                    (D) ensure that priority is given to the reentry 
                needs of high-risk populations, such as sex offenders, 
                career criminals, and prisoners with mental health 
                problems;
                    (E) coordinate and collaborate with other Federal 
                agencies and with State, Tribal, and local criminal 
                justice agencies, community-based organizations, and 
                faith-based organizations to help effectuate a seamless 
                reintegration of prisoners into communities;
                    (F) collect information about a prisoner's family 
                relationships, parental responsibilities, and contacts 
                with children to help prisoners maintain important 
                familial relationships and support systems during 
                incarceration and after release from custody; and
                    (G) provide incentives for prisoner participation in 
                skills development programs.
            (2) Incentives for a prisoner who participates in reentry 
        and skills development programs which may, at the discretion of 
        the Director, include--
                    (A) the maximum allowable period in a community 
                confinement facility; and
                    (B) such other incentives as the Director considers 
                appropriate (not including a reduction of the term of 
                imprisonment).

    (b) Identification and Release Assistance for Federal Prisoners.--
            (1) Obtaining identification.--The Director shall assist 
        prisoners in obtaining identification (including a social 
        security card, driver's license or other official photo 
        identification, or birth certificate) prior to release.
            (2) Assistance developing release plan.--At the request of a 
        direct-release prisoner, a representative of the United States 
        Probation System shall, prior to the release of that prisoner, 
        help that prisoner develop a release plan.
            (3) Direct-release prisoner defined.--In this section, the 
        term ``direct-release prisoner'' means a prisoner who is 
        scheduled for release and will not be placed in prerelease 
        custody.

    (c) Improved Reentry Procedures for Federal Prisoners.--The Attorney 
General shall take such steps as are necessary to modify the procedures 
and policies of the Department of Justice with respect to the transition 
of offenders from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to the 
community--
            (1) to enhance case planning and implementation of reentry 
        programs, policies, and guidelines;

[[Page 122 STAT. 685]]

            (2) to improve such transition to the community, including 
        placement of such individuals in community corrections 
        facilities; and
            (3) to foster the development of collaborative partnerships 
        with stakeholders at the national, State, and local levels to 
        facilitate the exchange of information and the development of 
        resources to enhance opportunities for successful offender 
        reentry.

                      report containing statistics demonstrating the 
                      relative reduction in recidivism for inmates 
                      released by the Bureau of Prisons within that 
                      fiscal year and the 2 prior fiscal years, 
                      comparing inmates who participated in major inmate 
                      programs (including residential drug treatment, 
                      vocational training, and prison industries) with 
                      inmates who did not participate in such programs. 
                      Such statistics shall be compiled separately for

                with the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 
                select a measure for recidivism (such as rearrest, 
                reincarceration, or any other valid, evidence-based 
                measure) that the Director considers appropriate and 
                that is consistent with the research undertaken by the 
                Bureau of Justice Statistics under section 241(b)(6).
                    (C) Goals.--
                          (i) In general.--After the Director submits

                                rate of recidivism by 2 percent; and
                                    (II) a 10-year goal to increase, at

        System shall take this information into account when developing 
        supervision plans in an effort to address the medical care and 
        mental health care needs of such individuals. The Bureau of 
        Prisons shall provide inmates with a sufficient amount of all
