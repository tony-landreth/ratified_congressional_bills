United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. PROJECT DEFINED.

    In this Act, the term ``project'' means only the portion of St.

Enhancements, & Community, & Economic Development'', dated June 1, 2006, 
on file with the St. Louis County department of highways and traffic.
SEC. 2. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN FEDERAL LAW.

    The St. Louis County arterial road 1151, known as the ``Lemay 
Connector Road'' in St. Louis City and County, Missouri, may be 
constructed, operated, and maintained over the deed-restricted property 
described in section 1, notwithstanding section 404(b)(2) of the Robert 
T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.

    The Federal Government shall not be liable for future flood damage 
that is caused by the project. St. Louis County, Missouri, or its 
assignee shall be liable for any future flood damage that is caused by 
the project.
