SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17701.>> FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds, on this, the 50th anniversary of the 
establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
following:
            (1) NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a 
        balanced and robust set of core missions in science, 
        aeronautics, and human space flight and exploration.
            (2) Investment in NASA's programs will promote innovation 
        through research and development, and will improve the 
        competitiveness of the United States.
            (3) Investment in NASA's programs, like investments in other 
        Federal science and technology activities, is an investment in 
        our future.
            (4) Properly structured, NASA's activities can contribute to 
        an improved quality of life, economic vitality, United States 
        leadership in peaceful cooperation with other nations on 
        challenging undertakings in science and technology, national 
        security, and the advancement of knowledge.
            (5) NASA should assume a leadership role in a cooperative 
        international Earth observations and research effort to address 
        key research issues associated with climate change and its 
        impacts on the Earth system.
            (6) NASA should undertake a program of aeronautical 
        research, development, and where appropriate demonstration 
        activities with the overarching goals of--
                    (A) ensuring that the Nation's future air 
                transportation system can handle up to 3 times the 
                current travel demand and incorporate new vehicle types 
                with no degradation in safety or adverse environmental 
                impact on local communities;
                    (B) protecting the environment;
                    (C) promoting the security of the Nation; and
                    (D) retaining the leadership of the United States in 
                global aviation.
            (7) Human and robotic exploration of the solar system will 
        be a significant long-term undertaking of humanity in the 21st 
        century and beyond, and it is in the national interest that the 
        United States should assume a leadership role in a cooperative 
        international exploration initiative.
            (8) Developing United States human space flight capabilities 
        to allow independent American access to the International Space 
        Station, and to explore beyond low Earth orbit, is a 
        strategically important national imperative, and all prudent 
        steps should thus be taken to bring the Orion Crew Exploration

[[Page 122 STAT. 4782]]

        Vehicle and Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle to full operational 
        capability as soon as possible and to ensure the effective 
        development of a United States heavy lift launch capability for 
        missions beyond low Earth orbit.
            (9) NASA's scientific research activities have contributed 
        much to the advancement of knowledge, provided societal 
        benefits, and helped train the next generation of scientists and 
        engineers, and those activities should continue to be an 
        important priority.
            (10) NASA should make a sustained commitment to a robust 
        long-term technology development activity. Such investments 
        represent the critically important ``seed corn'' on which NASA's 
        ability to carry out challenging and productive missions in the 
        future will depend.
            (11) NASA, through its pursuit of challenging and relevant 
        activities, can provide an important stimulus to the next 
        generation to pursue careers in science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics.
            (12) Commercial activities have substantially contributed to 
        the strength of both the United States space program and the 
        national economy, and the development of a healthy and robust 
        United States commercial space sector should continue to be 
        encouraged.
            (13) It is in the national interest for the United States to 
        have an export control policy that protects the national 
        security while also enabling the United States aerospace 
        industry to compete effectively in the global market place and 
        the United States to undertake cooperative programs in science 
        and human space flight in an effective and efficient manner.

generation of engineers and scientists and should be supported. In that 
regard, programs such as EarthKAM, which brings NASA directly into 
American classrooms by enabling students to talk directly with 
astronauts aboard the International Space Station and to take 
photographs of Earth from space, and NASA involvement in robotics 
competitions for students of all levels, are particularly worthy 
undertakings and NASA should support them and look for additional 
opportunities to engage students through NASA's space and aeronautics 
activities.

SEC. 704. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17781.>> ENHANCEMENT OF EDUCATIONAL ROLE OF 
            NASA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
International Space Station offers a unique opportunity for Federal 
agencies to engage students in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics education. Congress encourages NASA to include other Federal 
agencies in its planning efforts to use the International Space Station

                     TITLE VIII--NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS

SEC. 801. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17791.>> REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.

    (a) Reaffirmation of Policy on Surveying Near-Earth Asteroids and 
Comets.--Congress reaffirms the policy set forth in section 102(g) of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451(g)) 
(relating to surveying near-Earth asteroids and comets).
    (b) Sense of Congress on Benefits of Near-Earth Object Program 
Activities.--It is the sense of Congress that the near-Earth object 
program activities of NASA will provide benefits to the scientific and 
exploration activities of NASA.

SEC. 802. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17792.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to 
        humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or 
        comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of 
        the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 
        years ago.
            (2) Several such near-Earth objects have only been 
        discovered within days of the objects' closest approach to Earth 
        and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many 
        large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.
            (3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most 
        costly natural disasters that can occur.
            (4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a 
        collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with 
        Earth is measured in decades.
            (5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets 
        can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United 
        States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision 
        disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety 
        structure.
            (6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy 
        decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive 
        program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the 
        serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially 
        hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.
            (7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of 
        such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as 
        well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well 
        before a collision threat becomes known.

SEC. 803. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17793.>> REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION.

    The Administrator shall issue requests for information on--

[[Page 122 STAT. 4804]]

            (1) a low-cost space mission with the purpose of 
        rendezvousing with, attaching a tracking device, and 
        characterizing the Apophis asteroid; and
            (2) a medium-sized space mission with the purpose of 
        detecting near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters 
        in diameter.

SEC. 804. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17794.>> ESTABLISHMENT OF POLICY WITH RESPECT 
            TO THREATS POSED BY NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS.

    Within 2 <<NOTE: Deadline.>> years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Director of the OSTP shall--
            (1) develop a policy for notifying Federal agencies and 
        relevant emergency response institutions of an impending near-
        Earth object threat, if near-term public safety is at risk; and
            (2) <<NOTE: Recommen- dations.>> recommend a Federal agency 
        or agencies to be responsible for--
                    (A) protecting the United States from a near-Earth 
                object that is expected to collide with Earth; and
                    (B) implementing a deflection campaign, in 
                consultation with international bodies, should one be 
                necessary.

SEC. 805. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17795.>> PLANETARY RADAR CAPABILITY.

    The Administrator shall maintain a planetary radar that is 
comparable to the capability provided through the Deep Space Network 
Goldstone facility of NASA.

SEC. 806. ARECIBO OBSERVATORY.

    Congress reiterates its support for the use of the Arecibo 
Observatory for NASA-funded near-Earth object-related activities. The 
Administrator, using funds authorized in section 101(a)(1)(B), shall 
ensure the availability of the Arecibo Observatory's planetary radar to 
support these activities until the National Academies' review of NASA's 
approach for the survey and deflection of near-Earth objects, including 
a determination of the role of Arecibo, that was directed to be 
undertaken by the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Act, is 
completed.

SEC. 807. INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES.

    It is the sense of Congress that, since an estimated 25,000 
asteroids of concern have yet to be discovered and monitored, the United 
States should seek to obtain commitments for cooperation from other 
nations with significant resources for contributing to a thorough and 
timely search for such objects and an identification of their 
characteristics.

                    TITLE IX--COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES

SEC. 901. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that a healthy and robust commercial 
sector can make significant contributions to the successful conduct of 
NASA's space exploration program. While some activities are inherently 
governmental in nature, there are many other activities, such as routine 
supply of water, fuel, and other consumables to low Earth orbit or to 
destinations beyond low Earth orbit, and provision of power or 
communications services to lunar outposts, that potentially could be 
carried out effectively and efficiently by

[[Page 122 STAT. 4805]]

the commercial sector at some point in the future. Congress encourages 
NASA to look for such service opportunities and, to the maximum extent 
practicable, make use of the commercial sector to provide those 
services. It is further the sense of Congress that United States 
entrepreneurial space companies have the potential to develop and 
deliver innovative technology solutions at affordable costs. NASA is 
encouraged to use United States entrepreneurial space companies to 
conduct appropriate research and development activities. NASA is further 
encouraged to seek ways to ensure that firms that rely on fixed-price 
proposals are not disadvantaged when NASA seeks to procure technology 
development.

SEC. 902. <<NOTE: 42 USC 17801.>> COMMERCIAL CREW INITIATIVE.

    (a) In General.--In order to stimulate commercial use of space, help 
maximize the utility and productivity of the International Space 
Station, and enable a commercial means of providing crew transfer and 
crew rescue services for the International Space Station, NASA shall--
            (1) make use of United States commercially provided 
        International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue 
        services to the maximum extent practicable, if those commercial 
        services have demonstrated the capability to meet NASA-specified 
        ascent, entry, and International Space Station proximity 
        operations safety requirements;
            (2) limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of the 
        Crew Exploration Vehicle to missions carrying astronauts beyond 
        low Earth orbit once commercial crew transfer and crew rescue 
        services that meet safety requirements become operational;
            (3) facilitate, to the maximum extent practicable, the 
        transfer of NASA-developed technologies to potential United 
        States commercial crew transfer and rescue service providers, 
        consistent with United States law; and
            (4) <<NOTE: Notice. Deadline. Contracts.>> issue a notice of 
        intent, not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, to enter into a funded, competitively awarded Space 
        Act Agreement with 2 or more commercial entities for a Phase 1 
        Commercial Orbital Transportation Services crewed vehicle 
        demonstration program.

    (b) Congressional Intent.--It is the intent of Congress that funding 
for the program described in subsection (a)(4) shall not come at the 
expense of full funding of the amounts authorized under section 
101(3)(A), and for future fiscal years, for Orion Crew Exploration 
Vehicle development, Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle development, or 
International Space Station cargo delivery.
    (c) Additional Technologies.--NASA shall make International Space 
Station-compatible docking adaptors and other relevant technologies 
available to the commercial crew providers selected to service the 
International Space Station.
    (d) Crew Transfer and Crew Rescue Services Contract.--If a 
commercial provider demonstrates the capability to provide International 
Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue services and to satisfy NASA 
ascent, entry, and International Space Station proximity operations 
safety requirements, NASA shall enter into an International Space 
Station crew transfer and crew rescue services contract with that 
commercial provider for a portion of NASA's anticipated International 
Space Station crew transfer and crew

[[Page 122 STAT. 4806]]

rescue requirements from the time the commercial provider commences 
operations under contract with NASA through calendar year 2016, with an 
option to extend the period of performance through calendar year 2020.
