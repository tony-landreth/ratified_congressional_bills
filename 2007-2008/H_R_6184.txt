                 TITLE I--NATIONAL SITE QUARTER DOLLARS

SEC. 101. <<NOTE: 31 USC 5112 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Yellowstone National Park was established by an Act 
        signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the 
        Nation's first national park.
            (2) The summer and autumn of 1890 saw the establishment of a 
        number of national sites:
                    (A) August 19: Chickamauga and Chattanooga 
                established as national military parks in Georgia and 
                Tennessee.
                    (B) August 30: Antietam established as a national 
                battlefield site in Maryland.
                    (C) September 25: Sequoia National Park established 
                in California.
                    (D) September 27: Rock Creek Park established in the 
                District of Columbia.
                    (E) October 1: General Grant National Park 
                established in California (and subsequently incorporated 
                in Kings Canyon National Park).
                    (F) October 1: Yosemite National Park established in 
                California.
            (3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and 
        is considered by many to be our ``Conservationist President''.
            (4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt 
        witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and 
        the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the 
        habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation 
        increasingly became one of his major concerns.

[[Page 122 STAT. 5039]]

            (5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this 
        interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird 
        Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.
            (6) He also established the United States Forest Service, 
        signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the 
        Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under 
        which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.
            (7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the 
        United States was placed under public protection by Theodore 
        Roosevelt.
            (8) Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing short of defending 
        this country in wartime ``compares in importance with the great 
        central task of leaving this land even a better land for our 
        descendants than it is for us''.
            (9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed 
        by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.
            (10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering 
        more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the 
        District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the 
        Virgin Islands.
            (11) The sites or areas within the National Park System vary 
        widely in size and type from vast natural wilderness to 
        birthplaces of Presidents to world heritage archaeology sites to 
        an African burial ground memorial in Manhattan and include 
        national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, 
        historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, 
        recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.
            (12) In addition to the sites within the National Park 
        System, the United States has placed numerous other types of 
        sites under various forms of conservancy, such as the national 
        forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and 
        on the National Register of Historic Places.

                        NATIONAL PARKS OR OTHER NATIONAL SITES IN

                      and the governor or other chief executive of each

                      are not under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of 
                      the Interior so that the national site chosen for 
                      each State shall be the most appropriate in terms 
                      of natural or historic significance.
