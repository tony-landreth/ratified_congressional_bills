    ``(a) No Automatic Removal of Numbers.--Telephone numbers registered 
on the national `do-not-call' registry of the Telemarketing Sales Rule 
(16 CFR 310.4(b)(1)(iii)) since the establishment of the registry and 
telephone numbers registered on such registry after the date of 
enactment of this Act, shall not be removed from such registry except as 
provided for in subsection (b) or upon the request of the individual to 
whom the telephone number is assigned.
    ``(b) Removal of Invalid, Disconnected, and Reassigned Telephone 
Numbers.--The Federal Trade Commission shall periodically check 
telephone numbers registered on the national `do-not-call' registry 
against national or other appropriate databases and shall remove from

reassigned.   Nothing in this section prohibits the Federal Trade 
Commission from removing invalid telephone numbers from the registry at 
any time.''.
