    (a) Report.-- <<NOTE: Study. Deadline.>> Not later than one year 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education and 
the Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study to determine the 
feasibility and benefits of developing a system through which a borrower 
who is repaying a loan through the income contingent repayment plan or 
the income-based repayment program may make payments on the loan using 
the income tax withholding system (referred to in this section as 
``direct IDEA loans''). The goal of this program would be to--

        pertaining to income contingent repayment and income-based 
        repayment to the Department of Education, institutions, and 
        applicants.

    (b) Evaluations.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), the 
Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
evaluate--
            (1) the feasibility of implementing direct IDEA loans by the 
        Department of Education and the Department of the Treasury;
            (2) any advantages or disadvantages of direct IDEA loans on 
        borrowers and taxpayers;

[[Page 122 STAT. 3501]]

            (3) the program structure necessary to administer direct 
        IDEA loans; and

        contingent and income-based repayment collected through revenue 
        services, such as programs in England, Australia, and New 
        Zealand, could be effective in collecting loan payments under 
        the income contingent and income-based repayment options in the 
        United States.

    (c) Recommendations.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Not later than one year 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education and 
the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide a report on the study 
conducted under subsection (a) to Congress. The report shall include 
recommendations based on the factors examined in subsection (b) for 
implementing direct IDEA loans, including the necessary statutory 
changes needed to implement such repayment option.

Congress about alternatives ways to measure and report degree or program 
completion rates for institutions of higher education receiving funds 
under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et 
seq.).

SEC. 1121. NURSING SCHOOL CAPACITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Researchers in the field of public health have 
        identified the need for a national study to identify constraints 
        encountered by schools of nursing in graduating the number of 
        nurses sufficient to meet the health care needs of the United 
        States.
            (2) The shortage of qualified registered nurses has 
        adversely affected the health care system of the United States.
            (3) Individual States have had varying degrees of success 
        with programs designed to increase the recruitment and retention 
        of nurses.
            (4) Schools of nursing have been unable to provide a 
        sufficient number of qualified graduates to meet the workforce 
        needs.
            (5) Many nurses are approaching the age of retirement, and 
        the problem worsens each year.
            (6) In 2004, an estimated 125,000 applications from 
        qualified applicants were rejected by schools of nursing, due to 
        a shortage of faculty and a lack of capacity for additional 
        students.

    (b) Study With Respect to Constraints With Respect to Schools of 
Nursing.--
            (1) In <<NOTE: Contracts.>> general.--The Secretary shall

                    (A) identifying constraints encountered by schools 
                of nursing in admitting and graduating the number of 
                registered nurses necessary to ensure patient safety and 
                meet the need for quality assurance in the provision of 
                health care; and
                    (B) developing recommendations to alleviate the 
                constraints on a short-term and long-term basis.
            (2) Certain components.--The Secretary shall ensure that the

                schools of nursing that are relevant to the purpose of 
                the study, including trends regarding applicants who are 
                accepted for enrollment and applicants who are not 
                accepted, particularly qualified applicants who are not 
                accepted.
                    (B) The number and demographic characteristics of 
                entry-level and graduate students currently enrolled in 
                schools of nursing, the retention rates at the schools, 
                and

[[Page 122 STAT. 3504]]

                the number of recent graduates from the schools, as 
                compared to previous years and to the projected need for 
                registered nurses based on two-year, five-year, and ten-
                year projections.
                    (C) The number and demographic characteristics of 
                nurses who pursue graduate education in nursing and non-
                nursing programs but do not pursue faculty positions in 
                schools of nursing, the reasons for not pursuing faculty 
                positions, including any regulatory barriers to choosing 
                to pursue such positions, and the effect of such 
                decisions on the ability of the schools to obtain 
                adequate numbers of faculty members.
                    (D) The extent to which--
                          (i) entry-level graduates of the schools of 
                      nursing are satisfied with their educational

                practice, respectively.
                    (F) The extent to which the current salary, benefit 
                structures, and characteristics of the workplace, 
                including the number of nurses who are presently serving 
                in faculty positions, influence the career path of 
                nurses who have pursued graduate education.
                    (G) The extent to which the use of innovative 
                technologies for didactic and clinical nursing education 
                might provide for an increase in the ability of schools
