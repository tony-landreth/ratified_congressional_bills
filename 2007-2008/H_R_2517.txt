``SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    ``The Congress finds that--
            ``(1) each year thousands of children are abducted or 
        removed from the control of a parent having legal custody 
        without such parent's consent, under circumstances which 
        immediately place the child in grave danger;
            ``(2) many missing children are at great risk of both 
        physical harm and sexual exploitation;
            ``(3) in many cases, parents and local law enforcement 
        officials have neither the resources nor the expertise to mount 
        expanded search efforts;
            ``(4) abducted children are frequently moved from one 
        locality to another, requiring the cooperation and coordination 
        of local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts;
            ``(5) growing numbers of children are the victims of child 
        sexual exploitation, increasingly involving the use of new 
        technology to access the Internet;
            ``(6) children may be separated from their parents or legal 
        guardians as a result of national disasters such as hurricanes 
        and floods;
            ``(7) sex offenders pose a threat to children;
            ``(8) the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
        Prevention administers programs under this Act through the Child 
        Protection Division, including programs which prevent or address 
        offenses committed against vulnerable children and which support 
        missing children's organizations; and
            ``(9) a key component of such programs is the National 
        Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which--
                    ``(A) serves as a national resource center and 
                clearinghouse;

[[Page 122 STAT. 1561]]

                    ``(B) works in partnership with the Department of 
                Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United 
                States Marshals Service, the Department of the Treasury, 
                the Department of State, the Bureau of Immigration and 
                Customs Enforcement, the United States Secret Service, 
                the United States Postal Inspection Service, and many 
                other agencies in the effort to find missing children 
                and prevent child victimization; and
                    ``(C) operates a national network, linking the 
                Center online with each of the missing children 
                clearinghouses operated by the 50 States, the District 
                of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as with 
                international organizations, including Scotland Yard in 
                the United Kingdom, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
                INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and others, which 
                enable the Center to transmit images and information 
                regarding missing and exploited children to law 
                enforcement across the United States and around the 
                world instantly.''.
