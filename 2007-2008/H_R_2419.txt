            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide for an 
        adjustment, as appropriate, in the base acres for covered 
        commodities for a farm whenever any of the following 
        circumstances occurs:
                    (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into 
                under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 
                U.S.C. 3831) with respect to the farm expires or is 
                voluntarily terminated, or was terminated or expired 
                during the period beginning on October 1, 2007, and 
                ending on the date of enactment of this Act.

                conservation reserve contract by the Secretary, or was 
                released during the period beginning on October 1, 2007, 
                and ending on the date of enactment of this Act.
                    (C) The producer has eligible pulse crop acreage, 
                which shall be determined in the same manner as eligible 
                oilseed acreage under section 1101(a)(2) of the Farm 
                Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C.

                    (D) The producer has eligible oilseed acreage as the 
                result of the Secretary designating additional oilseeds, 
                which shall be determined in the same manner as eligible 
                oilseed acreage under section 1101(a)(2) of the Farm 
                Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 
                7911(a)(2)).
            (2) Special conservation reserve acreage payment rules.--For 
        the crop year in which a base acres adjustment under 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is first made, the 
        owner of the farm shall elect to receive either direct payments 
        and counter-cyclical payments with respect to the acreage added 
        to the farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under 
        the conservation reserve contract, but not both.

    (b) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
            (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a 
        farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph

[[Page 122 STAT. 939]]

        (2) exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the 
        Secretary shall reduce the base acres for 1 or more covered 
        commodities for the farm or the base acres for peanuts for the 
        farm so that the sum of the base acres and acreage described in 
        paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland acreage of the 
        farm.
            (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall include the following:
                    (A) Any base acres for peanuts for the farm.
                    (B) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the

                    (C) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a 
                Federal conservation program for which payments are made 
                in exchange for not producing an agricultural commodity 
                on the acreage.
                    (D) Any eligible pulse crop acreage, which shall be 
                determined in the same manner as eligible oilseed 
                acreage under section 1101(a)(2) of the Farm Security 
                and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7911(a)(2)).
                    (E) If the Secretary designates additional oilseeds, 
                any eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be determined 
                in the same manner as eligible oilseed acreage under 
                section 1101(a)(2) of the Farm Security and Rural 
                Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7911(a)(2)).
            (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner 
        of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for a 
        covered commodity or the base acres for peanuts for the farm 
        against which the reduction required by paragraph (1) will be 
        made.
            (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the case 
        of double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.
            (5) Coordinated application of requirements.--The Secretary 
        shall take into account section 1302(b) when applying the 
        requirements of this subsection.

            (1) Reduction at option of owner.--
                    (A) In general.--The owner of a farm may reduce, at 
                any time, the base acres for any covered commodity for 
                the farm.
                    (B) Effect of reduction.--A reduction under 
                subparagraph (A) shall be permanent and made in a manner

                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall proportionately 
                reduce base acres on a farm for covered commodities for 
                land that has been subdivided and developed for multiple 
                residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size 
                of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such 
                that the land is unlikely to return to the previous 
                agricultural use, unless the producers on the farm 
                demonstrate that the land--
                          (i) remains devoted to commercial agricultural 
                      production; or

[[Page 122 STAT. 940]]

                          (ii) is likely to be returned to the previous 
                      agricultural use.
                    (B) Requirement.--
                The <<NOTE: Procedures.>> Secretary shall establish 
                procedures to identify land described in subparagraph 
                (A).
            (3) Review and report.--Each year, to ensure, to the maximum 
        extent practicable, that payments are received only by 
        producers, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that 
        describes the results of the actions taken under paragraph (2).

    (d) Treatment of Farms With Limited Base Acres.--
            (1) Prohibition on payments.--Except as provided in 
        paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        title, a producer on a farm may not receive direct payments, 
        counter-cyclical payments, or average crop revenue election 
        payments if the sum of the base acres of the farm is 10 acres or 
        less, as determined by the Secretary.
            (2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a farm 
        owned by--
                    (A) a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher (as 
                defined in section 355(e) of the Consolidated Farm and

                    (B) perform an evaluation on the supply and price of 
                fruits and vegetables based on the effects of suspension 
                of base acres under this section.
SEC. 1102. <<NOTE: 7 USC 8712.>> PAYMENT YIELDS.

    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making direct 
payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subtitle, the 
Secretary shall provide for the establishment of a yield for each farm 
for any designated oilseed or eligible pulse crop for which a payment 
yield was not established under section 1102 of the Farm Security and 
Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7912) in accordance with this 
section.
    (b) Payment Yields for Designated Oilseeds and Eligible Pulse 
Crops.--
            (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of 
        designated oilseeds and eligible pulse crops, the Secretary 
        shall determine the average yield per planted acre for the 
        designated oilseed or pulse crop on a farm for the 1998 through 
        2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the acreage 
        planted to the designated oilseed or pulse crop was zero.
            (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--
                    (A) In general.--The payment yield for a farm for a 
                designated oilseed or eligible pulse crop shall be equal 
                to the product of the following:
                          (i) The average yield for the designated 
                      oilseed or pulse crop determined under paragraph 
                      (1).
                          (ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the 
                      national average yield for the designated oilseed 
                      or pulse crop

[[Page 122 STAT. 941]]

                      for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the national 
                      average yield for the designated oilseed or pulse 
                      crop for the 1998 through 2001 crops.
                    (B) No national average yield information 
                available.--To the extent that national average yield 
                information for a designated oilseed or pulse crop is 
                not available, the Secretary shall use such information 
                as the Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to 
                establish a national average yield under this section.
            (3) Use of partial county average yield.--If the yield per 
        planted acre for a crop of a designated oilseed or pulse crop 
        for a farm for any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less 
        than 75 percent of the county yield for that designated oilseed 
        or pulse crop, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop 
        year equal to 75 percent of the county yield for the purpose of 
        determining the average under paragraph (1).
            (4) No historic yield data available.--In the case of 
        establishing yields for designated oilseeds and eligible pulse 
        crops, if historic yield data is not available, the Secretary 
        shall use the ratio for dry peas calculated under paragraph 
        (2)(A)(ii) in determining the yields for designated oilseeds and 
        eligible pulse crops, as determined to be fair and equitable by 
        the Secretary.

            (3) ACRE program guarantee price.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1)(A)(ii), the ACRE program guarantee price for a crop year for 
        a covered commodity or peanuts in a State shall be the simple 
        average of the national average market price received by 
        producers of the covered commodity or peanuts for the most 
        recent 2 crop years, as determined by the Secretary.
            (4) States with irrigated and nonirrigated land.--In the 
        case of a State in which at least 25 percent of the acreage 
        planted to a covered commodity or peanuts in the State is 
        irrigated and at least 25 percent of the acreage planted to the 
        covered commodity or peanuts in the State is not irrigated, the 
        Secretary shall calculate a separate ACRE program guarantee for 
        the irrigated and nonirrigated areas of the State for the 
        covered commodity or peanuts.

    (e) Actual Farm Revenue.--For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B)(i), 
the amount of the actual farm revenue for a crop year for a covered 
commodity or peanuts shall equal the amount determined by multiplying--

(b)(2)(B)(ii), the farm ACRE benchmark revenue for the crop year for a 
covered commodity or peanuts shall equal the sum obtained by adding--
            (1) the amount determined by multiplying--
                    (A) the average yield per planted acre for the 
                covered commodity or peanuts of the producers on the 
                farm for the most recent 5 crop years, excluding each of 
                the crop years with the highest and lowest yields; and
                    (B) the ACRE program guarantee price for the 
                applicable crop year for the covered commodity or 
                peanuts in a State determined under subsection (d)(3); 
                and
            (2) the amount of the per acre crop insurance premium 
        required to be paid by the producers on the farm for the 
        applicable crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts on the 
        farm.

    (g) Payment Amount.--If ACRE payments are required to be paid for 
any of the 2009 through 2012 crop years of a covered commodity or 
peanuts under this section, the amount of the ACRE payment to be paid to 
the producers on the farm for the crop

[[Page 122 STAT. 949]]

year under this section shall be equal to the product obtained by 
multiplying--
            (1) the lesser of--
                    (A) the difference between--
                          (i) the ACRE program guarantee for the crop 
                      year for the covered commodity or peanuts in the 
                      State determined under subsection (d); and
                          (ii) the actual State revenue from the crop 
                      year for the covered commodity or peanuts in the 
                      State determined under subsection (c); and
                    (B) 25 percent of the ACRE program guarantee for the 
                crop year for the covered commodity or peanuts in the 
                State determined under subsection (d);
            (2)(A) for each of the 2009 through 2011 crop years, 83.3 
        percent of the acreage planted or considered planted to the 
        covered commodity or peanuts for harvest on the farm in the crop 
        year; and
            (B) for the 2012 crop year, 85 percent of the acreage 
        planted or considered planted to the covered commodity or

                    (A) the average yield per planted acre for the 
                covered commodity or peanuts of the producers on the 
                farm for the most recent 5 crop years, excluding each of 
                the crop years with the highest and lowest yields; by
                    (B) the benchmark State yield for the crop year, as

determined in accordance with this subtitle and subtitles B through E.
    (c) Adjustment on County Basis.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may establish loan rates for 
        a crop for producers in individual counties in a manner that 
        results in the lowest loan rate being 95 percent of the national 
        average loan rate, if those loan rates do not result in an 
        increase in outlays.
            (2) Prohibition.--Adjustments under this subsection shall 
        not result in an increase in the national average loan rate for

                      and
                          (iv) a mechanism to ensure that no premium or 
                      discount is established that exceeds the premium 
                      or discount associated with a leaf grade that is 1 
                      better than the applicable color grade.
                    (C) Discretionary revisions.--Revisions under 
                subparagraph (A) may include--
                          (i) the use of non-spot market price data, in 
                      addition to spot market price data, that would 
                      enhance the accuracy of the price information used 
                      in determining quality adjustments under this 
                      subsection;
                          (ii) adjustments in the premiums or discounts 
                      associated with upland cotton with a staple length 
                      of 33 or above due to micronaire with the goal of 
                      eliminating any unnecessary artificial splits in 
                      the calculations of the premiums or discounts; and

                paragraph (2)(B); or
                    (B) revoking or revising any actions taken or

SEC. 8003. COMMUNITY FOREST AND OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION PROGRAM.

    (a) <<NOTE: 16 USC 2103d note.>>  Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Forest Service projects that, by calendar year 2030, 
        approximately 44,000,000 acres of privately-owned forest land 
        will be developed throughout the United States;
            (2) public access to parcels of privately-owned forest land 
        for outdoor recreational activities, including hunting, fishing, 
        and trapping, has declined and, as a result, participation in 
        those activities has also declined in cases in which public 
        access is not secured;
            (3) rising rates of obesity and other public health problems 
        relating to the inactivity of the citizens of the United States 
        have been shown to be ameliorated by improving public access to 
        safe and attractive areas for outdoor recreation;
            (4) in rapidly-growing communities of all sizes throughout 
        the United States, remaining parcels of forest land play an 
        essential role in protecting public water supplies;
            (5) forest parcels owned by local governmental entities and 
        nonprofit organizations are providing important demonstration 
        sites for private landowners to learn forest management 
        techniques;
            (6) throughout the United States, communities of diverse 
        types and sizes are deriving significant financial and community 
        benefits from managing forest land owned by local governmental 
        entities for timber and other forest products; and
            (7) there is an urgent need for local governmental entities 
        to be able to leverage financial resources in order to purchase 
        important parcels of privately-owned forest land as the parcels 
        are offered for sale.

    (b) Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program.--The 
Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended by inserting 
after section 7 (16 U.S.C. 2103c) the following new section:

    ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--If a taxpayer holds a qualified tax 
credit bond on one or more credit allowance dates of the bond during any 
taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed 
by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of the 
credits determined under subsection (b) with respect to such dates.

            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the credit determined under 
        this subsection with respect to any credit allowance date for a 
        qualified tax credit bond is 25 percent of the annual credit 
        determined with respect to such bond.
            ``(2) Annual credit.--The annual credit determined with 
        respect to any qualified tax credit bond is the product of--

                    ``(B) the outstanding face amount of the bond.

        (2), the applicable credit rate is the rate which the Secretary 
        estimates will permit the issuance of qualified tax credit bonds 
        with a specified maturity or redemption date without discount 
        and without interest cost to the qualified issuer. The 
        applicable

        of a bond which is issued during the 3-month period ending on a 
        credit allowance date, the amount of the credit determined under 
        this subsection with respect to such credit allowance date shall 
        be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise determined based on 
        the portion of the 3-month period during which the bond is 
        outstanding. <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  A similar rule shall 
        apply when the bond is redeemed or matures.

        under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation imposed by paragraph 
        (1) for such taxable year, such excess shall be carried to the 
        succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under
