SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 (49 
        U.S.C. 40101 note) establishes a Federal cause of action in the 
        United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
        York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out of the 
        hijacking and subsequent crash of American Airlines flights 11 
        and 77, and United Airlines flights 93 and 175, on September 11, 
        2001.
            (2) Rules 45(b)(2) and 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules 
        of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena to 
        any place within, or within 100 miles of, the district of the 
        court by which it is issued, unless a statute of the United 
        States expressly provides that the court, upon proper 
        application and cause shown, may authorize the service of a 
        subpoena at any other place.
            (3) Litigating a Federal cause of action under the September 
        11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 is likely to involve the 
        testimony and the production of other documents and tangible 
        things by a substantial number of witnesses, many of whom may 
        not reside, be employed, or regularly transact business in, or 
        within 100 miles of, the Southern District of New York.
SEC. 3. NATIONWIDE SUBPOENAS.

    Section 408(b) of the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 
(49 U.S.C. 40101 note) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Nationwide subpoenas.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A subpoena requiring the 
                attendance of a witness at trial or a hearing conducted 
                under this section may be served at any place in the 
                United States.
                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                subsection is intended to diminish the authority of a 
                court 


[[Page 121 STAT. 1040]]

                to quash or modify a subpoena for the reasons provided 
                in clause (i), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A) or 
                subparagraph (B) of rule 45(c)(3) of the Federal Rules 
                of Civil Procedure.''.

    Approved November 8, 2007.
