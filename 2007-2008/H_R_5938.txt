        commercial advantage or private financial benefit.
            (3) The potential and actual loss resulting from the offense

                protected computer, regardless of whether the owner was 
                deprived of use of the information; and
                    (B) where the information obtained constitutes a 
                trade secret or other proprietary information, the cost 
                the victim incurred developing or compiling the 
                information.
            (4) Whether the defendant acted with intent to cause either 
        physical or property harm in committing the offense.
            (5) The extent to which the offense violated the privacy 
        rights of individuals.

        United States Government, a State, or a local government in 
        furtherance of national defense, national security, or the 
        administration of justice.
            (8) Whether the offense was intended to, or had the effect 
        of, significantly interfering with or disrupting a critical 
        infrastructure.
            (9) Whether the offense was intended to, or had the effect 
        of, creating a threat to public health or safety, causing injury 
        to any person, or causing death.
            (10) Whether the defendant purposefully involved a juvenile 
        in the commission of the offense.
            (11) Whether the defendant's intent to cause damage or 
        intent to obtain personal information should be disaggregated 
        and considered separately from the other factors set forth in 
        USSG 2B1.1(b)(14).
            (12) Whether the term ``victim'' as used in USSG 2B1.1, 
        should include individuals whose privacy was violated as a 
        result of the offense in addition to individuals who suffered 
        monetary harm as a result of the offense.

[[Page 122 STAT. 3565]]

            (13) Whether the defendant disclosed personal information 
        obtained during the commission of the offense.

        applicable sentencing ranges;
            (3) make any conforming changes to the sentencing 
        guidelines; and
            (4) assure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes
