Public Law 110-175
110th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To promote accessibility, accountability, and openness in Government by 
   strengthening section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
     referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), and for other 
             purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 31, 2007 -  [S. 2488]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Openness 
Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007.>> 
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 5 USC 101 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes Effectiveness in 
our National Government Act of 2007'' or the ``OPEN Government Act of 
2007''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 5 USC 552 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on 
        July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--
                    (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of 
                self-government, and our commitment to popular 
                sovereignty depends upon the consent of the governed;
                    (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is 
                informed consent; and
                    (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion 
                in Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective 
                functioning of a free government like ours depends 
                largely on the force of an informed public opinion. This 
                calls for the widest possible understanding of the 
                quality of government service rendered by all elective 
                or appointed public officials or employees.'';
            (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of 
        government must itself be governed by a presumption of openness;
            (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong 
        presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United 
        States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. Ray 
        (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all 
        agencies governed by that Act;
            (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of 
        the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in 
        Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));
            (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not 
        always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and
            (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title 5, 
        United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of 
        Information Act), in order to determine whether further changes 
        and improvements are necessary to ensure that the

[[Page 121 STAT. 2525]]

        Government remains open and accessible to the American people 
        and is always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon the 
        fundamental ``right to know''.
SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.

    Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is amended 
by adding at the end the following:
    ``In this clause, the term `a representative of the news media' 
means any person or entity that gathers information of potential 
interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn 
the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an 
audience. In this clause, the term `news' means information that is 
about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. 
Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but 
only if such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make their 
products available for purchase by or subscription by or free 
distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-
inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, 
the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through 
telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered 
to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as 
working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or 
not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication 
contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the 
Government may also consider the past publication record of the 
requester in making such a determination.''.
SEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States 
Code, is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
                          ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a 
                      complainant has substantially prevailed if the 
                      complainant has obtained relief through either--
                    ``(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written 
                agreement or consent decree; or
                    ``(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position 
                by the agency, if the complainant's claim is not 
                insubstantial.''.

    (b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding <<NOTE: 5 USC 552 note.>> section 
1304 of title 31, United States Code, no amounts may be obligated or 
expended from the Claims and Judgment Fund of the United States Treasury 
to pay the costs resulting from fees assessed under section 552(a)(4)(E) 
of title 5, United States Code. Any such amounts shall be paid only from 
funds annually appropriated for any authorized purpose for the Federal 
agency against which a claim or judgment has been rendered.
SEC. 5. <<NOTE: Reports.>> DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ARBITRARY AND 
                    CAPRICIOUS REJECTIONS OF REQUESTS.

    Section 552(a)(4)(F) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(F)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(ii) The Attorney General shall--

[[Page 121 STAT. 2526]]

            ``(I) <<NOTE: Notification.>> notify the Special Counsel of 
        each civil action described under the first sentence of clause 
        (i); and
            ``(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number of 
        such civil actions in the preceding year.

    ``(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report to 
Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under clause 
(i).''.
SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR AGENCIES TO ACT ON REQUESTS.

    (a) Time Limits.--
            (1) In general.--Section 552(a)(6)(A) of title 5, United 
        States Code, is amended by inserting after clause (ii) the

        days after the request is first received by any component of the 
        agency that is designated in the agency's regulations under this 
        section to receive requests under this section. The 20-day 
        period shall not be tolled by the agency except--
                          ``(I) that the agency may make one request to 
                      the requester for information and toll the 20-day 
                      period while it is awaiting such information that 
                      it has reasonably requested from the requester 
                      under this section; or
                          ``(II) if necessary to clarify with the 
                      requester issues regarding fee assessment. In 
                      either case, the agency's receipt of the 
                      requester's response to the agency's request for 
                      information or clarification ends the tolling

                          ``(viii) An agency shall not assess search 
                      fees (or in the case of a requester described 
                      under clause (ii)(II), duplication fees) under 
                      this subparagraph if the agency fails to comply 
                      with any time limit under paragraph (6), if no 
                      unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those 
                      terms are defined for purposes of paragraphs 
                      (6)(B) and (C), respectively) apply to the 
                      processing of the request.''.
                    (B) Public liaison.--Section 552(a)(6)(B)(ii) of 
                title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting
