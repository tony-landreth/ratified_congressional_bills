    (a) <<NOTE: 21 USC 301 note.>>  Short Title.--This title may be 
cited as the ``Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2008''.

    (b) <<NOTE: 21 USC 379j-21 note.>>  Findings.--Congress finds as 
follows:
            (1) Prompt approval of abbreviated applications for safe and 
        effective generic new animal drugs will reduce animal healthcare 
        costs and promote the well-being of animal health and the public 
        health.
            (2) Animal health and the public health will be served by 
        making additional funds available for the purpose of augmenting 
        the resources of the Food and Drug Administration that are 
        devoted to the process for the review of abbreviated 
        applications for the approval of generic new animal drugs.
            (3) The fees authorized by this title will be dedicated 
        toward expediting the generic new animal drug development 
        process and the review of abbreviated applications for generic 
        new animal drugs, supplemental abbreviated applications for 
        generic new animal drugs, and investigational submissions for 
        generic new animal drugs as set forth in the goals identified in 
        the letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to 
        the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the 
        House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on 
        Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate as set 
        forth in the Congressional Record.

                new animal drug shall be subject to a fee as established 
                in subsection (b) for such an application.
                    ``(B) Payment.--The fee required by subparagraph (A) 
                shall be due upon submission of the abbreviated 
                application.

                If an abbreviated application was submitted by a person 
                that paid the fee for such application, was accepted for 
                filing, and was not approved or was withdrawn (without a 
                waiver or refund), the submission of an abbreviated 
                application for the same product by the same person (or 
                the person's licensee, assignee, or successor) shall not 
                be subject to a fee under subparagraph (A).
                    ``(D) Refund of fee if application refused for 
                filing.--The Secretary shall refund 75 percent of the 
                fee paid under subparagraph (B) for any abbreviated 
                application which is refused for filing.
                    ``(E) Refund of fee if application withdrawn.--If an 
                abbreviated application is withdrawn after the 
                application was filed, the Secretary may refund the fee 
                or portion of the fee paid under subparagraph (B) if no 
                substantial work was performed on the application after 
                the application was filed. The Secretary shall have the 
                sole discretion to refund the fee under this 
                subparagraph. A determination by the Secretary 
                concerning a refund under this subparagraph shall not be 
                reviewable.

                supplemental abbreviated application,
        shall pay for each such generic new animal drug product the 
        annual fee established in subsection (b). Such fee shall be 
        payable for the fiscal year in which the generic new animal drug 
        product is first submitted for listing under section 510, or is 
        submitted for relisting under section 510 if the generic new 
        animal drug product has been withdrawn from listing and 
        relisted. <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  After such fee is paid for that 
        fiscal year, such fee shall be payable on or before January 31 
        of each year. Such fee shall be paid only once for each generic 
        new animal drug product for a fiscal year in which the fee is

    ``(b) Fee Amounts.--Except as provided in subsection (a)(1) and 
subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g), the fees required under subsection 
(a) shall be established to generate fee revenue amounts as follows:

        fee revenues to be collected in abbreviated application fees 
        under subsection (a)(1) shall be $1,449,000 for fiscal year 
        2009, $1,532,000 for fiscal year 2010, $1,619,000 for fiscal 
        year 2011, $1,712,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $1,809,000 for

        revenues to be collected in generic new animal drug product fees 
        under subsection (a)(2) shall be $1,691,000 for fiscal year

        year 2011, $1,997,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $2,111,000 for

    ``(c) Adjustments.--
            ``(1) Workload adjustment.--The fee revenues shall be 
        adjusted each fiscal year after fiscal year 2009 to reflect 
        changes in review workload. With respect to such adjustment:
                    ``(A) This adjustment shall be determined by the 
                Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in 
                the total number of abbreviated applications for generic 
                new animal drugs, manufacturing supplemental abbreviated 
                applications for generic new animal drugs, 
                investigational generic new animal drug study 
                submissions, and investigational generic new animal drug 
                protocol submissions submitted to the 
                Secretary. <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>>  The 
                Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees 
                resulting from this adjustment and the supporting 
                methodologies.
                    ``(B) Under no circumstances shall this workload 
                adjustment result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that 
                are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year 
                established in subsection (b).
            ``(2) Final year adjustment.--For fiscal year 2013, the 
        Secretary may further increase the fees to provide for up to

[[Page 122 STAT. 3518]]

        3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the 
        process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic 
        new animal drugs for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2014. If 
        the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the 
        process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic 
        new animal drugs in excess of 3 months of such operating 
        reserves, then this adjustment shall not be made. If this 
        adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of 
        the increase shall be contained in the annual notice setting 
        fees for fiscal year 2013.
            ``(3) <<NOTE: Deadline. Effective date.>>  Annual fee 
        setting.--The Secretary shall establish, 60 days before the 
        start of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2008, 
        for that fiscal year, abbreviated application fees, generic new 
        animal drug sponsor fees, and generic new animal drug product 
        fees based on the revenue amounts established under subsection 
        (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection.
            ``(4) Limit.--The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted 
        under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the 
        total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for 
        the process for the review of abbreviated applications for 
        generic new animal drugs.

    ``(d) Fee Waiver or Reduction.--The Secretary shall grant a waiver 
from or a reduction of 1 or more fees assessed under subsection (a) 
where the Secretary finds that the generic new animal drug is intended 
solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication.
    ``(e) Effect of Failure To Pay Fees.--An abbreviated application for 
a generic new animal drug submitted by a person subject to fees under 
subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted 
for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been 
paid. An investigational submission for a generic new animal drug that 
is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be 
considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the 
Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. The 
Secretary may discontinue review of any abbreviated application for a 
generic new animal drug, supplemental abbreviated application for a 
generic new animal drug, or investigational submission for a generic new 
animal drug from a person if such person has not submitted for payment 
all fees owed under this section by 30 days after the date upon which 
they are due.
    ``(f) Assessment of Fees.--
            ``(1) Limitation.--Fees may not be assessed under subsection 
        (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008 unless 
        appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug 
        Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of 
        fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater 
        than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses 
        of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 
        (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) 
        multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal 
        year involved.
            ``(2) Authority.--If the Secretary does not assess fees 
        under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because 
        of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the 
        Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess

[[Page 122 STAT. 3519]]

        and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for 
        abbreviated applications, generic new animal drug sponsors, and 
        generic new animal drug products at any time in such fiscal year 
        notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the 
        date fees are to be paid.

    ``(g) Crediting and Availability of Fees.--
            ``(1) In general.--Fees authorized under subsection (a) 
        shall be collected and available for obligation only to the 
        extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations 
        Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain 
        available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be 
        transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and 
        expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to 
        such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such 
        fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available 
        solely for the process for the review of abbreviated 
        applications for generic new animal drugs.

                any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations 
                and allocated for the process for the review of

        section for fiscal year 2012 exceeds the cumulative amount 
        appropriated under paragraph (3) for the fiscal years 2009 
        through 2012, the excess amount shall be credited to the

subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated 
as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of 
chapter 37 of title 31, United States Code.

    ``(i) Written Requests for Waivers, Reductions, and Refunds.--
To <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  qualify for consideration for a waiver or 
reduction under subsection (d), or for a refund of any fee collected in 
accordance with subsection (a), a person shall submit to the Secretary a 
written request for such waiver, reduction, or refund not later than 180 
days after such fee is due.

    ``(j) Construction.--This section may not be construed to require 
that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of 
Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory 
committees not engaged in the process of the review of abbreviated 
applications for generic new animal drugs, be reduced to offset the 
number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.
    ``(k) Definitions.--In this section and section 742:

        drug.--The terms `abbreviated application for a generic new 
        animal drug' and `abbreviated application' mean an abbreviated 
        application for the approval of any generic new animal drug 
        submitted under section 512(b)(2). Such term does not include a 
        supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal 
        drug.

        applicable to a fiscal year is the Consumer Price Index for all 
        urban consumers (all items; United States city average) for 
        October of the preceding fiscal year divided by--
