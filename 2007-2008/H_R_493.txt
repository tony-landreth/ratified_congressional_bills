SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 2000ff note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other 
        advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical 
        progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness will 
        allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms 
        have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps 
        to reduce the likelihood that they will contract

[[Page 122 STAT. 882]]

        a particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow 
        for the development of better therapies that are more effective 
        against disease or have fewer side effects than current 
        treatments. These advances give rise to the potential misuse of 
        genetic information to discriminate in health insurance and 
        employment.
            (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State 
        laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having 
        presumed genetic ``defects'' such as mental retardation, mental 
        disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other 
        conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State 
        of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted 
        sterilization laws to ``correct'' apparent genetic traits or 
        tendencies. Many of these State laws have since been repealed, 
        and many have been modified to include essential constitutional 
        requirements of due process and equal protection. However, the 
        current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of 
        sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, 
        compels Congressional action in this area.
            (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many 
        genetic conditions and disorders are associated with particular 
        racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic traits 
        are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular 
        group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of 
        that genetic information. This form of discrimination was 
        evident in the 1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen 
        and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which 
        afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began 
        to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s 
        began mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for 
        sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination and unnecessary 
        fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, Congress in 1972 passed 
        the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which withholds 
        Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is 
        voluntary.
            (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic 
        discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of pre-
        employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 
        which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that 
        case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 
        1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling 
        public interest in relieving the fear of discrimination and in 
        prohibiting its actual practice in employment and health 
        insurance.
            (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health 
        insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and 
        depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have 
        enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws 
        vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and 
        level of protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence 
        that the American public and the medical community find the 
        existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be confusing and 
        inadequate to protect them from discrimination. Therefore 
        Federal legislation establishing a national and uniform basic 
        standard is necessary to fully protect the public from 
        discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential

[[Page 122 STAT. 883]]

        for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to take 
        advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and new 
        therapies.

         TITLE I--GENETIC NONDISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE

SEC. 101. AMENDMENTS TO EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 
                        1974.

    (a) No Discrimination in Group Premiums Based on Genetic 
Information.--Section 702(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1182(b)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (2)(A), by inserting before the semicolon 
        the following: ``except as provided in paragraph (3)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) No group-based discrimination on basis of genetic 
        information.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of this section, a 
                group health plan, and a health insurance issuer 
                offering group health insurance coverage in connection 
                with a group health plan, may not adjust premium or 
                contribution amounts for the group covered under such 
                plan on the basis of genetic information.
                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in subparagraph 
                (A) or in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d) shall 
                be construed to limit the ability of a health insurance 
                issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection 
                with a group health plan to increase the premium for an 
                employer based on the manifestation of a disease or 
                disorder of an individual who is enrolled in the plan. 
                In such case, the manifestation of a disease or disorder 
                in one individual cannot also be used as genetic 
                information about other group members and to further 
                increase the premium for the employer.''.

    (b) Limitations on Genetic Testing; Prohibition on Collection of 
Genetic Information; Application to All Plans.--Section 702 of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1182) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Genetic Testing.--

        testing.--A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer 
        offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group 
        health plan, shall not request or require an individual or a 
        family member of such individual to undergo a genetic test.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be 
        construed to limit the authority of a health care professional 
        who is providing health care services to an individual to 
        request that such individual undergo a genetic test.
            ``(3) Rule of construction regarding payment.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be 
                construed to preclude a group health plan, or a health 
                insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in 
                connection with a group health plan, from obtaining and 
                using the results of a genetic test in making a 
                determination regarding payment (as such term is defined
