        the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal interest where such 
        interest will be reimbursed for such construction under any 
        provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal 
        interest has entered into a written partnership agreement with 
        the Secretary (or, where appropriate, the district engineer for 
        the district in which the project will be carried out) under

        Federal interest and are less than $25,000.

        into by a State, or a body politic of the State which derives 
        its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity 
        created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that 
        it does not obligate future appropriations for such performance 
        and payment when obligating future appropriations would be 
        inconsistent with constitutional or statutory limitations of the 
        State or a political subdivision of the State.

improvements, the Secretary may recommend a project without the need to 
demonstrate that the project is justified solely by national economic 
development benefits if the Secretary determines that--

        70 miles from the nearest surface accessible commercial port and 
        has no direct rail or highway link to another community served 
        by a surface accessible port or harbor; or

        Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
        Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, or 
        American Samoa;
            (2) the harbor is economically critical such that over 80 
        percent of the goods transported through the harbor would be 
        consumed within the community served by the harbor and 
        navigation improvement; and
            (3) the long-term viability of the community would be 
        threatened without the harbor and navigation improvement.

under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the benefits of the 
project to--
            (1) public health and safety of the local community, 
        including access to facilities designed to protect public health 
        and safety;
            (2) access to natural resources for subsistence purposes;
            (3) local and regional economic opportunities;

agency that provides the funds determines that the funds are authorized 
to be used to carry out the study or project.

participation in the project.
    (b)  Cost Sharing.--An increase in the maximum amount of Federal 
funds that may be allocated for a water resources project, or an 
increase in the total cost of a water resources project, authorized to 
be carried out by the Secretary shall not affect any cost-sharing 
requirement applicable to the project.
    (c) Cost Estimates.--The estimated Federal and non-Federal costs of 
water resources projects authorized to be carried out by the Secretary 
before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act are for

SEC. 2029. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CRITERIA FOR OPERATION AND 
                          MAINTENANCE OF HARBOR DREDGING PROJECTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Insufficient maintenance dredging results in inefficient 
        water transportation and harmful economic consequences.
            (2) The estimated dredging backlog at commercial harbors in 
        the Great Lakes alone is 16,000,000 cubic yards.
            (3) Approximately two-thirds of all shipping in the United 
        States either starts or finishes at small harbors.
            (4) Small harbors often have a greater proportional impact 
        on local economies than do larger harbors.
            (5) Performance metrics can be valuable tools in the budget 
        process for water resources projects.
            (6) The use of a single performance metric for water 
        resources projects can result in a budget biased against small 
        and rural communities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
operations and maintenance budget of the Corps of Engineers should 
reflect the use of all available economic data, rather than a single 
performance metric.

                and uncertainty analysis.
                    (B) The assessment and incorporation of public 
                safety in the formulation of alternatives and 
                recommended plans.
                    (C) Assessment methods that reflect the value of 
                projects for low-income communities and projects that 
                use nonstructural approaches to water resources 
                development and management.
                    (D) The assessment and evaluation of the interaction 
                of a project with other water resources projects and 
                programs within a region or watershed.

            (1) In general.--In carrying out a water resources project 
        that involves wetlands mitigation and that has impacts that 
        occur within the service area of a mitigation bank, the 
        Secretary, where appropriate, shall first consider the use of 
        the mitigation bank if the bank contains sufficient available 
        credits to offset the impact and the bank is approved in 
        accordance with the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use 
        and Operation of Mitigation Banks (60 Fed. Reg. 58605) or other 
        applicable Federal law (including regulations).
