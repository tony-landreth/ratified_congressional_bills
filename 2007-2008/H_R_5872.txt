        on February 8, 2010.
            (2) The Boy Scouts of America is the largest youth

            (3) Since 1910, more than 111,000,000 youth have

            (4) The Boy Scouts of America was granted a Federal charter

        Representative and the Senate have participated in Boy Scouts of

            (6) The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is ``to prepare 
        young people to make ethical and moral choices over their 
        lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and 
        Law''.
            (7) Every day across our Nation, Scouts and their leaders

        will do my best, To do my duty to God and my country and to obey 
        the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself 
        physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight''--and

        Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent''.
            (8) In the past 4 years alone, Scouting youth and their

        their communities through more than 75,000 service projects,
