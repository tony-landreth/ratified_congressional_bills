        for implementation of the changes in the NAIC model law and 
        regulations approved by the National Association of Insurance 
        Commissioners in its Model #651 (``Model Regulation

[[Page 122 STAT. 2502]]

        to Implement the NAIC Medicare Supplement Insurance Minimum 
        Standards Model Act'') on March 11, 2007, as modified to reflect

            (2) Implementation dates.--
                    (A) In general.--The modifications to Model #651 
                required under paragraph (1) shall be completed by the

                conform the regulatory program established by the State 
                to such revised NAIC model law and regulations, the 
                State shall not be regarded as failing to comply with

                its failure to meet such requirements before the first 
                day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the 
                close of the first regular session of the State 
                legislature that begins after the date of the enactment

                the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative 
                session, each year of the session is considered to be a 
                separate regular session of the State legislature.

                regulations and State law (as in effect prior to the 
                adoption of such revised NAIC model law and regulations) 
                prior to June 1, 2010. Nothing shall preclude carriers 
                from marketing new or revised medicare supplemental 
                policies or certificates that meet the requirements of 
                such revised NAIC model law and regulations on or after 
                the date on which the State conforms the regulatory 
                program established by the State to such revised NAIC 
                model law and regulations.

    (b) Required Offering of a Range of Policies.--Section 1882(o) of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395s(o)), <<NOTE: 42 USC 
1395ss.>> as amended by section 104(b)(3) of the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-233), is amended by adding

but which are not reimbursable by reason of the applicability of 
deductibles, coinsurance, copayments or other limitations imposed by a 
Medicare Advantage plan (including a Medicare Advantage private fee-for-
service plan) under part C of such title shall comply with the 
requirements of section 1882(o) of the such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ss(o)).

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a demonstration 
project to allow eligible entities to develop and test new models for 
the delivery of health care services in eligible counties for the 
purpose of improving access to, and better integrating the delivery of, 
acute care, extended care, and other essential health care services to

        adequacy of, payments for acute care, extended care, and other 
        essential health care services provided under the Medicare and 
        Medicaid programs in eligible counties; and
            (2) evaluate regulatory challenges facing such providers and 
        the communities they serve.

demonstration project:

        reasonable costs of the provider in furnishing acute care, 
        extended care, and other essential health care services to 
        Medicare beneficiaries.

        process under the Medicare program and the Medicaid program 
        across all health service categories included in the 
        demonstration project shall be tested with the goal of assuring 
        quality and safety while reducing administrative burdens, as 
        appropriate, related to completing such survey and certification 
        process.
            (3) Health care providers in eligible counties selected to 
        participate in the demonstration project under subsection (d)(3)

                with respect to Medicare Advantage plans incur in 
                providing coverage under the plan for items and services 
                covered under the original Medicare fee-for-service 
                program under parts A and B of title XVIII of the Social 
                Security Act, as reflected in plan bids; and
                    (B) county-level spending under such original 
                Medicare fee-for-service program on a per capita basis, 
                as calculated by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for 
                Medicare & Medicaid Services.
        The study with respect to the issue described in the preceding 
        sentence shall include differences in correlation statistics by 
        plan type and geographic area.
            (2) Based on these results of the study with respect to the 
        issue described in paragraph (1), and other data the Commission 
        determines appropriate--
                    (A) alternate approaches to payment with respect to 
                a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare Advantage 
                plan other than through county-level payment area 
                equivalents.
                    (B) the accuracy and completeness of county-level 
                estimates of per capita spending under such original 
                Medicare fee-for-service program (including counties in 
                Puerto Rico), as used to determine the annual Medicare 
                Advantage capitation rate under section 1853 of the 
                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23), and whether 
                such estimates include--
                          (i) expenditures with respect to Medicare 
                      beneficiaries at facilities of the Department of 
                      Veterans Affairs; and
                          (ii) all appropriate administrative expenses, 
                      including claims processing.
            (3) Ways to improve the accuracy and completeness of county-
        level estimates of per capita spending described in paragraph 
        (2)(B).

    (b) Report.--Not later than March 31, 2010, the Commission shall
