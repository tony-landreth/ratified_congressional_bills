    ``For the purposes of this subpart:
            ``(1) Eligible institution.--The term `eligible institution' 
        means an institution of higher education, as defined in section 
        102, that the Secretary determines--

                professional development services, including extensive 
                clinical experience as a part of pre-service

                of teaching; and
                    ``(D) provides supervision and support services to 
                teachers, or assistance in the provision of such 
                services, including mentoring focused on developing 
                effective teaching skills and strategies.
            ``(2) Post-baccalaureate.--The term `post-baccalaureate' 
        means a program of instruction for individuals who have 
        completed a baccalaureate degree, that does not lead to a 
        graduate degree, and that consists of courses required by a 
        State in order for a teacher candidate to receive a professional 
        certification or licensing credential that is required for 
        employment as a teacher in an elementary school or secondary 
        school in that State, except that such term shall not include 
        any program of instruction offered by an eligible institution 
        that offers a baccalaureate degree in education.
            ``(3) Teacher candidate.--The term `teacher candidate' means 
        a student or teacher described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of 
        section 420N(a)(2).

``SEC. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1070g-1.>> 420M. PROGRAM ESTABLISHED.

    ``(a) Program Authority.--
            ``(1) Payments required.--The Secretary shall pay to each 
        eligible institution such sums as may be necessary to pay to 
        each teacher candidate who files an application and agreement in 
        accordance with section 420N, and who qualifies under paragraph 
        (2) of section 420N(a), a TEACH Grant in the amount of $4,000 
        for each academic year during which that teacher candidate is in 
        attendance at the institution.
            ``(2) References.--Grants made under paragraph (1) shall be 
        known as `Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher 
        Education Grants' or `TEACH Grants'.

    ``(b) Payment Methodology.--
            ``(1) Prepayment.--Not <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
        publication.>> less than 85 percent of any funds provided to an 
        eligible institution under subsection (a) shall be advanced to 
        the eligible institution prior to the start of each payment 
        period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the 
        institution as needed to pay teacher candidates until such time 
        as the Secretary determines and publishes in the Federal 
        Register with an opportunity for comment, an alternative payment 
        system that provides payments to institutions in an accurate and 
        timely manner, except that this sentence shall not be construed 
        to limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution 
        on a reimbursement system of payment.
            ``(2) Direct payment.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        interpreted to prohibit the Secretary from paying directly to 
        teacher candidates, in advance of the beginning of the academic 
        term, an amount for which teacher candidates are eligible, in 
        cases where the eligible institution elects not to participate 
        in the disbursement system required by paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Distribution of grants to teacher candidates.--
        Payments under this subpart shall be made, in accordance with 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such purpose, in 
        such manner as will best accomplish the purposes of this 
        subpart. Any disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the 
        teacher candidate's account shall be limited to tuition and fees 
        and, in the case of institutionally-owned housing, room and 
        board. The teacher candidate may elect to have the institution 
        provide other such goods and services by crediting the teacher 
        candidate's account.

    ``(c) Reductions in Amount.--
            ``(1) Part-time students.--In any case where a teacher 
        candidate attends an eligible institution on less than a full-
        time basis (including a teacher candidate who attends an 
        eligible institution on less than a half-time basis) during any 
        academic year, the amount of a grant under this subpart for 
        which that teacher candidate is eligible shall be reduced in 
        proportion to the degree to which that teacher candidate is not 
        attending on a full-time basis, in accordance with a schedule of 
        reductions established by the Secretary for the purposes of this 
        subpart, computed in accordance with this subpart. 
        Such <<NOTE: Regulations. Federal Register, 
        publication.>> schedule of reductions shall be established by 
        regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance 
        with section 482 of this Act.
            ``(2) No exceeding cost.--The amount of a grant awarded 
        under this subpart, in combination with Federal assistance

[[Page 121 STAT. 788]]

        and other student assistance, shall not exceed the cost of 
        attendance (as defined in section 472) at the eligible 
        institution at which that teacher candidate is in attendance. 
        If, with respect to any teacher candidate for any academic year, 
        it is determined that the amount of a TEACH Grant exceeds the 
        cost of attendance for that year, the amount of the TEACH Grant 
        shall be reduced until such grant does not exceed the cost of 
        attendance at the eligible institution.

        baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate course of study being 
        pursued by the teacher candidate at the eligible institution at

        receive under this subpart for graduate study shall not exceed 
        $8,000.

        section shall be construed to exclude from eligibility courses 
        of study which are noncredit or remedial in nature (including 
        courses in English language acquisition) which are determined by 
        the eligible institution to be necessary to help the teacher 
        candidate be prepared for the pursuit of a first undergraduate 
        baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degree or certificate or, in 
        the case of courses in English language instruction, to be 
        necessary to enable the teacher candidate to utilize already 
        existing knowledge, training, or skills. Nothing in this section 
        shall be construed to exclude from eligibility programs of study 
        abroad that are approved for credit by the home institution at
