                employees to defined or specific unscheduled call shifts 
                that are followed by shifts not subject to call, as a 
                method for reducing employee fatigue.

SEC. 210. FOSTERING INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE 
                        SAFETY AT HIGHWAY-RAIL GRADE CROSSINGS.

    (a) Amendment.--Subchapter II of chapter 201, as amended by section 
204 of this division, is further amended by adding at the end the 
following:
``Sec. 20161. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve 
                    safety at highway-rail grade crossings

    ``(a) Findings.--
            ``(1) Collisions between highway users and trains at 
        highway-rail grade crossings continue to cause an unacceptable 
        loss of life, serious personal injury, and property damage.
            ``(2) While elimination of at-grade crossings through 
        consolidation of crossings and grade separations offers the 
        greatest long-term promise for optimizing the safety and 
        efficiency of the two modes of transportation, over 140,000 
        public grade crossings remain on the general rail system--
        approximately one for each route mile on the general rail 
        system.
            ``(3) Conventional highway traffic control devices such as 
        flashing lights and gates are often effective in warning 
        motorists of a train's approach to an equipped crossing.
            ``(4) Since enactment of the Highway Safety Act of 1973, 
        over $4,200,000,000 of Federal funding has been invested in 
        safety improvements at highway-rail grade crossings, yet a 
        majority of public highway-rail grade crossings are not yet 
        equipped with active warning systems.
            ``(5) The emergence of new technologies presents 
        opportunities for more effective and affordable warnings and 
        safer passage of highway users and trains at remaining highway-
        rail grade crossings.

[[Page 122 STAT. 4877]]

            ``(6) Implementation of new crossing safety technology will 
        require extensive cooperation between highway authorities and 
        railroad carriers.
            ``(7) Federal Railroad Administration regulations 
        establishing performance standards for processor-based signal 
        and train control systems provide a suitable framework for 
        qualification of new or novel technology at highway-rail grade 
        crossings, and the Federal Highway Administration's Manual on 
        Uniform Traffic Control Devices provides an appropriate means of 
        determining highway user interface with such new technology.

    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to encourage 
the development of new technology that can prevent loss of life and 
injuries at highway-rail grade crossings. The Secretary of 
Transportation is designated to carry out this policy in consultation 
with States and necessary public and private entities.
    ``(c) Submission of New Technology Proposals.--Railroad carriers and 
railroad suppliers may submit for review and approval to the Secretary 
such new technology designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade 
crossings. The Secretary shall approve by order the new technology 
designed to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings in accordance 
with Federal Railroad Administration standards for the development and 
use of processor-based signal and train control systems and shall 
consider the effects on safety of highway-user interface with the new 
technology.
    ``(d) Effect of Secretarial Approval.--If the Secretary approves by 
order new technology to provide warning to highway users at a highway-
rail grade crossing and such technology is installed at a highway-rail 
grade crossing in accordance with the conditions of the approval, this 
determination preempts any State statute or regulation concerning the 
adequacy of the technology in providing warning at the crossing.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter 201, as 
amended by section 204 of this division, is further amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 20160, the following:

``20161. Fostering introduction of new technology to improve safety at 
           highway-rail grade crossings.''.

        bridge, its configuration, type of construction, number of 
        spans, span lengths, and all other information necessary to 
        provide for the safe management of the bridges;

[[Page 122 STAT. 4891]]

            (2) to ensure that a professional engineer competent in the 
        field of railroad bridge engineering, or a qualified person 
        under the supervision of the track owner, determines bridge 
        capacity;
            (3) to maintain, and update as appropriate, a record of the 
        safe capacity of each bridge which carries its track and, if 
        available, maintain the original design documents of each bridge 
        and a documentation of all repairs, modifications, and 
        inspections of the bridge;
            (4) to develop, maintain, and enforce a written procedure 
        that will ensure that its bridges are not loaded beyond their 
        capacities;
            (5) to conduct regular comprehensive inspections of each 
        bridge, at least once every year, and maintain records of those 
        inspections that include the date on which the inspection was 
        performed, the precise identification of the bridge inspected, 
        the items inspected, an accurate description of the condition of 
        those items, and a narrative of any inspection item that is 
        found by the inspector to be a potential problem;
            (6) to ensure that the level of detail and the inspection 
        procedures are appropriate to the configuration of the bridge, 
        conditions found during previous inspections, and the nature of 
        the railroad traffic moved over the bridge, including car 
        weights, train frequency and length, levels of passenger and 
        hazardous materials traffic, and vulnerability of the bridge to 
        damage;
            (7) to ensure that an engineer who is competent in the field 
        of railroad bridge engineering--
                    (A) is responsible for the development of all 
                inspection procedures;
                    (B) reviews all inspection reports; and

                according to the applicable procedures and frequency, 
                and reviews any items noted by an inspector as 
                exceptions; and
            (8) to designate qualified bridge inspectors or maintenance 
        personnel to authorize the operation of trains on bridges 
        following repairs, damage, or indications of potential 
        structural problems.

    (c) Use of Bridge Management Programs Required.--The Secretary shall 
instruct bridge experts to obtain copies of the most recent bridge 
management programs of each railroad within the expert's areas of 
responsibility, and require that experts use those programs when 
conducting bridge observations.
    (d) Review of Data.--The Secretary shall establish a program to 
periodically review bridge inspection and maintenance data from railroad 
carrier bridge inspectors and Federal Railroad Administration bridge 
experts.

            ``(3) the timeline for Board review, including a requirement 
        that the Board approve or deny an exemption within 90 days after 
        the full record for the application is developed;
            ``(4) the expedited review timelines for petitions for

        rail carrier that owns or operates such a facility to petition 
        the Board for a land-use exemption.

    ``(c) Standard for Review.--
            ``(1) The Board may only issue a land-use exemption if it 
        determines that the facility at the existing or proposed 
        location does not pose an unreasonable risk to public health, 
        safety, or the environment. In deciding whether a solid waste 
        rail transfer facility that is or proposed to be constructed or 
        operated by or on behalf of a rail carrier poses an unreasonable 
        risk to public health, safety, or the environment, the Board 
        shall weigh the particular facility's potential benefits to and 
        the adverse impacts on public health, public safety, the 
        environment, interstate commerce, and transportation of solid 
        waste by rail.
            ``(2) The Board may not grant a land-use exemption for a 
        solid waste rail transfer facility proposed to be located on 
        land within any unit of or land affiliated with the National 
        Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National 
        Wilderness Preservation System, the National Trails System, the 
        National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, a National Reserve, a 
        National Monument, or lands referenced in Public Law 108-421 for 
        which a State has implemented a conservation management plan, if 
        operation of the facility would be inconsistent with 
        restrictions placed on such land.

    ``(d) Considerations.--When evaluating an application under this 
section, the Board shall consider and give due weight to the following, 
as applicable:
            ``(1) the land-use, zoning, and siting regulations or solid 
        waste planning requirements of the State or State subdivision in 
        which the facility is or will be located that are applicable to 
        solid waste transfer facilities, including those that are not 
        owned or operated by or on behalf of a rail carrier;
            ``(2) the land-use, zoning, and siting regulations or solid 
        waste planning requirements applicable to the property where the 
        solid waste rail transfer facility is proposed to be located;
            ``(3) regional transportation planning requirements 
        developed pursuant to Federal and State law;
            ``(4) regional solid waste disposal plans developed pursuant 
        to State or Federal law;
            ``(5) any Federal and State environmental protection laws or 
        regulations applicable to the site;
            ``(6) any unreasonable burdens imposed on the interstate 
        transportation of solid waste by railroad, or the potential for 
        discrimination against the railroad transportation of solid 
        waste, a solid waste rail transfer facility, or a rail carrier 
        that owns or operates such a facility; and
            ``(7) any other relevant factors, as determined by the 
        Board.

    ``(e) Existing Facilities.--Upon the granting of petition from the 
State in which a solid waste rail transfer facility is operating as of 
the date of enactment of the Clean Railroads Act of 2008 by the Board, 
the facility shall submit a complete application for a siting permit to 
the Board pursuant to the procedures issued pursuant to subsection (b). 
No State may enforce a law, regulation, order, or other requirement 
affecting the siting of a facility that is operating as of the date of 
enactment of the Clean Railroads

[[Page 122 STAT. 4905]]

Act of 2008 until the Board has approved or denied a permit pursuant to 
subsection (c).
    ``(f) Effect of Land-Use Exemption.--If the Board grants a land-use 
exemption to a solid waste rail transfer facility, all State laws, 
regulations, orders, or other requirements affecting the siting of a 
facility are preempted with regard to that facility. An exemption may 
require compliance with such State laws, regulations, orders, or other 
requirements.
    ``(g) Injunctive Relief.--Nothing in this section precludes a person 
from seeking an injunction to enjoin a solid waste rail transfer 
facility from being constructed or operated by or on behalf of a rail 
carrier if that facility has materially violated, or will materially 
violate, its land-use exemption or if it failed to receive a valid land-
use exemption under this section.
    ``(h) Fees.--The Board may charge permit applicants reasonable fees 
to implement this section, including the costs of third-party 
consultants.
    ``(i) Definitions.--In this section the terms `solid waste', `solid 
waste rail transfer facility', and `State requirements' have the meaning 
given such terms in section 10908(e).''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter 109, as 
amended by section 603 of this division, is amended by inserting after 
the item relating to section 10908 the following:

``10909. Solid waste rail transfer facility land-use exemption.''.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 109, as amended by section 604, is further 
amended by adding at the end thereof the following:

traditional police powers of the State to require a rail carrier to 
comply with State and local environmental, public health, and public 
safety standards that are not unreasonably burdensome to interstate 
commerce and do not discriminate against rail carriers.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter 109, as 
amended by section 604 of this division, is amended by inserting after 
the item relating to section 10909 the following:

methodology for establishing and allocating the operating and capital 
costs among the States and Amtrak associated with trains operated on 
each of the routes described in section 24102(5)(B) and (D) and section 
24702 that--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> ensures, within 5 years after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, equal treatment in the provision 
        of like services of all States and groups of States (including 
        the District of Columbia); and
            (2) allocates to each route the costs incurred only for the 
        benefit of that route and a proportionate share, based upon 
        factors that reasonably reflect relative use, of costs incurred 
        for the common benefit of more than 1 route.

    (b) Revisions.--The Amtrak Board of Directors, in consultation with 
the Secretary, the governors of each relevant State, and the Mayor of 
the District of Columbia, or entities representing those officials, may 
revise or amend the methodology established under subsection (a) as 
necessary, consistent with the intent of this section, including 
revisions or modifications based on Amtrak's financial accounting system 
developed pursuant to section 203 of this division.
    (c) Review.--If <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Amtrak and the States (including 
the District of Columbia) in which Amtrak operates such routes do not 
voluntarily adopt and implement the methodology developed under 
subsection (a) in allocating costs and determining compensation for the 
provision of service in accordance with the date established therein, 
the Surface Transportation Board shall determine the appropriate 
methodology required under subsection (a) for such services in 
accordance with the procedures and procedural schedule applicable to a 
proceeding under section 24904(c) of title 49, United States Code, and 
require the full implementation of this methodology with regards to the 
provision of such service within 1 year after the Board's determination 
of the appropriate methodology.

    (d) Use of Chapter 244 Funds.--Funds provided to a State under

SEC. 213. PASSENGER TRAIN PERFORMANCE.

    (a) In General.--Section 24308 <<NOTE: 49 USC 24308.>> is amended by 
adding at the end the following:

    ``(f) Passenger Train Performance and Other Standards.--
            ``(1) Investigation of substandard performance.--If the on-
        time performance of any intercity passenger train averages less 
        than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive calendar quarters, or the 
        service quality of intercity passenger train operations for 
        which minimum standards are established under section 207 of the 
        Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 fails to 
        meet those standards for 2 consecutive calendar quarters, the 
        Surface Transportation Board (referred to in this section as the 
        `Board') may initiate an investigation, or upon the filing of a 
        complaint by Amtrak, an intercity passenger rail operator, a 
        host freight railroad over which Amtrak operates, or an entity 
        for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service, the 
        Board shall initiate such an investigation,

[[Page 122 STAT. 4926]]

        to determine whether and to what extent delays or failure to 
        achieve minimum standards are due to causes that could 
        reasonably be addressed by a rail carrier over whose tracks the 
        intercity passenger train operates or reasonably addressed by 
        Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators. As part of 
        its investigation, the Board has authority to review the 
        accuracy of the train performance data and the extent to which 
        scheduling and congestion contribute to delays. 
        In <<NOTE: Recommen- dations.>> making its determination or 
        carrying out such an investigation, the Board shall obtain 
        information from all parties involved and identify reasonable 
        measures and make recommendations to improve the service, 
        quality, and on-time performance of the train.
            ``(2) Problems caused by host rail carrier.--If the Board 
        determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum standards 
        investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable to a rail 
        carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight 
        transportation as required under subsection (c), the Board may 
        award damages against the host rail carrier, including 
        prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it determines to be 
        reasonable and appropriate pursuant to paragraph (3) of this 
        subsection.
            ``(3) Damages and relief.--In awarding damages and 
        prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board shall 
        consider such factors as--
                    ``(A) the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial 
                loss as a result of host rail carrier delays or failure 
                to achieve minimum standards; and
                    ``(B) what reasonable measures would adequately 
                deter future actions which may reasonably be expected to 
                be likely to result in delays to Amtrak on the route 
                involved.
            ``(4) Use of damages.--The Board shall, as it deems 
        appropriate, order the host rail carrier to remit the damages 
        awarded under this subsection to Amtrak or to an entity for 
        which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service. Such 
        damages shall be used for capital or operating expenditures on 
        the routes over which delays or failures to achieve minimum 
        standards were the result of a rail carrier's failure to provide 
        preference to Amtrak over freight transportation as determined 
        in accordance with paragraph (2).''.

    (b) Fees.--The <<NOTE: 49 USC 24308 note.>> Surface Transportation 
Board may establish and collect filing fees from any entity that files a 
complaint under section 24308(f)(1) of title 49, United States Code, or 
otherwise requests or requires the Board's services pursuant to this 
division. The Board shall establish such fees at levels that will fully 
or partially, as the Board determines to be appropriate, offset the 
costs of adjudicating complaints under that section and other requests 
or requirements for Board action under <<NOTE: Waiver authority.>> this 
division. The Board may waive any fee established under this subsection 
for any governmental entity as determined appropriate by the Board.

    (c) Authorization of Additional Staff.--The Surface Transportation 
Board may increase the number of Board employees by up to 15 for the 5 
fiscal year period beginning with fiscal year 2009 to carry out its 
responsibilities under section 24308 of title 49, United States Code, 
and this division.
    (d) Change of Reference.--Section 24308 <<NOTE: 49 USC 24308.>> is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``Interstate Commerce Commission'' in 
        subsection (a)(2)(A) and inserting ``Surface Transportation 
        Board'';

[[Page 122 STAT. 4927]]

            (2) by striking ``Commission'' each place it appears and 
        inserting ``Board'';
            (3) by striking ``Secretary of Transportation'' in 
        subsection (c) and inserting ``Board''; and

        in subsection (c) and each place it appears in subsections (d) 
        and (e) and inserting ``Board''.

        exceed 5 years after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail 
        Investment and Improvement Act of 2008;
            ``(2) <<NOTE: Notification. Deadlines.>> requires the

        awarding contracts to bidders seeking to operate routes that 
        have been identified as one of the five worst performing Amtrak 
        routes under section 24710;
            ``(5) requires the Administration to execute a contract 
        within a specified, limited time after the deadline established

        service outlined in the bid, and such staffing plan be made 
        available by the winning bidder to the public after the bid 
        award.

    ``(b) Route Limitations.--The Administration may not make the 
program available with respect to more than 2 Amtrak intercity passenger 
rail routes.
    ``(c) Performance Standards; Access to Facilities; Employees.--If 
the Administration awards the right and obligation to provide passenger

under any contractual agreement with Amtrak.
    (b) Conditions for Financial Incentives.--
As <<NOTE: Certification.>> a condition for receiving financial 
assistance grants under this section, Amtrak must certify that--
            (1) a reasonable attempt was made to reassign an employee 
        adversely affected under section 24711 of title 49, United 
        States Code, or by the elimination of any route, to other

to provide services required for the operation of an intercity passenger 
train route described in section 24102(5)(D) or 24702 of title 49, 
United States Code, the State may make an agreement with Amtrak to use 
facilities and equipment of, or have services provided by, Amtrak under 
terms agreed to by the State and Amtrak to enable the State to utilize 
an entity other than Amtrak to provide services required for operation 
of the route. If <<NOTE: Deadline. Order.>> the parties cannot agree 
upon terms, and the Surface Transportation Board finds that access to 
Amtrak's facilities or equipment, or the provision of services by 
Amtrak, is necessary to carry out this provision and that the operation 
of Amtrak's other services will not be impaired thereby, the Surface 
Transportation Board shall, within 120 days after submission of the 
dispute, issue an order that the facilities and equipment be made 
available, and that services be provided, by Amtrak, and shall determine 
reasonable compensation, liability, and other terms for use of the 
facilities and equipment and provision of the services. Compensation 
shall be determined, as appropriate, in accordance with the methodology 
established pursuant to section 209 of this division, if available.

SEC. 228. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN 
                        AMTRAK AS A NATIONAL PASSENGER RAIL 
                        SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In fiscal year 2007, 3,800,000 passengers traveled on 
        Amtrak's long-distance trains, an increase of 2.4 percent over 
        fiscal year 2006.
            (2) Amtrak long-distance routes generated $376,000,000 in 
        revenue in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 5 percent over 
        fiscal year 2006.
            (3) Amtrak operates 15 long-distance trains over 18,500 
        route miles that serve 39 States and the District of Columbia. 
        These trains provide the only rail passenger service to 23 
        States.
            (4) Amtrak's long-distance trains provide an essential 
        transportation service for many communities and to a significant 
        percentage of the general public.
            (5) Many long-distance trains serve small communities with 
        limited or no significant air or bus service, especially in 
        remote or isolated areas in the United States.
            (6) As a result of airline deregulation and decisions by 
        national bus carriers to leave many communities, rail 
        transportation may provide the only feasible common carrier 
        transportation option for a growing number of areas.

[[Page 122 STAT. 4935]]

            (7) If long-distance trains were eliminated, 23 States and 
        243 communities would be left with no intercity passenger rail 
        service and 16 other States would lose some rail service. These 
        trains provide a strong economic benefit for the States and 
        communities that they serve.
            (8) Long-distance trains also provide transportation during 
        periods of severe weather or emergencies that stall other modes 
        of transportation.
            (9) Amtrak provided the only reliable long-distance 
        transportation following the September 11, 2001, terrorist 
        attacks that grounded air travel.
            (10) The majority of passengers on long-distance trains do 
        not travel between the endpoints, but rather between any 
        combination of cities along the route.
            (11) Passenger trains provide transportation options, 
        mobility for underserved populations, congestion mitigation, and 
        jobs in the areas they serve.
            (12) Passenger rail has a positive impact on the environment 
        compared to other modes of transportation by conserving energy, 
        reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and cutting down on other 
        airborne particulate and toxic emissions.
            (13) Amtrak communities that are served use passenger rail 
        and passenger rail stations as a significant source of economic 
        development.
            (14) This division makes meaningful and important reforms to 
        increase the efficiency, profitability and on-time performance 
        of Amtrak's long-distance routes.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) long-distance passenger rail is a vital and necessary 
        part of our national transportation system and economy; and
            (2) Amtrak should maintain a national passenger rail system, 
        including long-distance routes, that connects the continental 
        United States from coast to coast and from border to border.

times of commuter usage.
SEC. 403. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COMMUTER RAIL EXPANSION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress find the following:
            (1) In 2006, Americans took 10.1 billion trips on public 
        transportation for the first time since 1949.
            (2) The Northeast region is one of the Nation's largest 
        emerging transportation ``megaregions'' where infrastructure 
        expansion and improvements are most needed.
            (3) New England's road traffic has increased two to three 
        times faster than its population since 1990.
            (4) Connecticut has one of the Nation's longest average 
        commute times according to the United States Census Bureau, and 
        80 percent of Connecticut commuters drive by themselves to work, 
        demonstrating the need for expanded commuter rail access.
            (5) The Connecticut Department of Transportation has pledged 
        to modernize, repair, and strengthen the rail line 
        infrastructure to provide for increased safety and security 
        along a crucial transportation corridor in the Northeast.
            (6) Expanded New Haven-Springfield rail service would 
        improve access to Bradley International Airport, one the 
        region's busiest airports, as well as to Hartford, Connecticut,

[[Page 122 STAT. 4957]]

        and Springfield, Massachusetts, two of the region's commercial, 
        residential, and industrial centers.
            (7) Expanded commuter rail service on the New Haven-
        Springfield line could result in an estimated 630,000 additional 
        trips per year and 2,215,384 passenger miles per year, helping 
        to curb pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from road vehicle 
        traffic.
            (8) The MetroNorth New Haven Line and Shore Line East 
        railways saw respective 3.43 percent and 4.93 percent increases 
        in ridership over the course of 2007, demonstrating the need for 
        expanded commuter rail service in Connecticut.
            (9) Expanded New Haven-Springfield commuter rail service 
        could provide transportation nearly 17 times more efficient in 
        terms of average mileage versus road vehicles, alleviating road 
        congestion and providing a significant savings to consumers 
        during a time of high gas prices.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
expanded commuter rail service on the rail line between New Haven, 
Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts, is an important 
transportation priority, and Amtrak should work cooperatively with the 
States of Connecticut and Massachusetts to enable expanded commuter rail 
service on such line.
    (c) Infrastructure Maintenance Report.--Amtrak shall submit a report 
to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate, and to the State Departments of 
Transportation of Connecticut and Massachusetts, on the total cost of 
uncompleted infrastructure maintenance on the rail line between New 
Haven, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts.
