SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8501.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of 
        Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons 
        and ballistic missiles and its support for international 
        terrorism, represent a threat to the security of the United 
        States, its strong ally Israel, and other allies of the United 
        States around the world.
            (2) The United States and other responsible countries have a 
        vital interest in working together to prevent the Government of 
        Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.
            (3) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly 
        called attention to Iran's illicit nuclear activities and, as a 
        result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range 
        of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to 
        suspend those activities and comply with its obligations under 
        the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at 
        Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into 
        force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-
        Proliferation Treaty'').
            (4) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran 
        demands that the United States work together with its allies to 
        do everything possible--diplomatically, politically, and 
        economically--to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons 
        capability.
            (5) The United States and its major European allies, 
        including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have 
        advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international 
        diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of 
        Iran's uranium enrichment program and an end to its nuclear 
        weapons program and other illicit nuclear activities.
            (6) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, 
        systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights, including 
        suppression of freedom of expression and religious freedom, 
        illegitimately prolonged detention, torture, and executions. 
        Such violations have increased in the aftermath of the 
        fraudulent presidential election in Iran on June 12, 2009.
            (7) The Government of Iran has been unresponsive to 
        President Obama's unprecedented and serious efforts at 
        engagement, revealing that the Government of Iran is not 
        interested in a diplomatic resolution, as made clear, for 
        example, by the following:
                    (A) Iran's apparent rejection of the Tehran Research 
                Reactor plan, generously offered by the United States 
                and its partners, of potentially great benefit to the 
                people of Iran, and endorsed by Iran's own negotiators 
                in October 2009.

[[Page 124 STAT. 1314]]

                    (B) Iran's ongoing clandestine nuclear program, as 
                evidenced by its work on the secret uranium enrichment 
                facility at Qom, its subsequent refusal to cooperate 
                fully with inspectors from the International Atomic 
                Energy Agency, and its announcement that it would build 
                10 new uranium enrichment facilities.
                    (C) Iran's official notification to the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency that it would enrich 
                uranium to the 20 percent level, followed soon 
                thereafter by its providing to that Agency a laboratory 
                result showing that Iran had indeed enriched some 
                uranium to 19.8 percent.
                    (D) A February 18, 2010, report by the International 
                Atomic Energy Agency expressing ``concerns about the 
                possible existence in Iran of past or current 
                undisclosed activities related to the development of a 
                nuclear payload for a missile. These alleged activities 
                consist of a number of projects and sub-projects, 
                covering nuclear and missile related aspects, run by 
                military-related organizations.''.
                    (E) A May 31, 2010, report by the International 
                Atomic Energy Agency expressing continuing strong 
                concerns about Iran's lack of cooperation with the 
                Agency's verification efforts and Iran's ongoing 
                enrichment activities, which are contrary to the 
                longstanding demands of the Agency and the United 
                Nations Security Council.
                    (F) Iran's announcement in April 2010 that it had 
                developed a new, faster generation of centrifuges for 
                enriching uranium.
                    (G) Iran's ongoing arms exports to, and support for, 
                terrorists in direct contravention of United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions.
                    (H) Iran's July 31, 2009, arrest of 3 young citizens 
                of the United States on spying charges.
            (8) There is an increasing interest by State governments, 
        local governments, educational institutions, and private 
        institutions, business firms, and other investors to 
        disassociate themselves from companies that conduct business 
        activities in the energy sector of Iran, since such business 
        activities may directly or indirectly support the efforts of the 
        Government of Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.
            (9) Black market proliferation networks continue to flourish 
        in the Middle East, allowing countries like Iran to gain access 
        to sensitive dual-use technologies.
            (10) Economic sanctions imposed pursuant to the provisions 
        of this Act, the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by this 
        Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
        U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and other authorities available to the 
        United States to impose economic sanctions to prevent Iran from 
        developing nuclear weapons, are necessary to protect the 
        essential security interests of the United States.
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL 
                    SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO IRAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) international diplomatic efforts to address Iran's 
        illicit nuclear efforts and support for international terrorism 
        are more likely to be effective if strong additional sanctions 
        are imposed on the Government of Iran;

[[Page 124 STAT. 1315]]

            (2) the concerns of the United States regarding Iran are 
        strictly the result of the actions of the Government of Iran;
            (3) the revelation in September 2009 that Iran is developing 
        a secret uranium enrichment site on a base of Iran's 
        Revolutionary Guard Corps near Qom, which appears to have no 
        civilian application, highlights the urgency that Iran--
                    (A) disclose the full nature of its nuclear program, 
                including any other secret locations; and
                    (B) provide the International Atomic Energy Agency 
                unfettered access to its facilities pursuant to Iran's 
                legal obligations under the Treaty on the Non-
                Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, 
                London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force 
                March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-
                Proliferation Treaty'') and Iran's safeguards agreement 
                with the International Atomic Energy Agency;
            (4) because of the involvement of Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
        Corps in Iran's nuclear program, international terrorism, and 
        domestic human rights abuses, the President should impose the 
        full range of applicable sanctions on--
                    (A) any individual or entity that is an agent, 
                alias, front, instrumentality, representative, official, 
                or affiliate of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps; and
                    (B) any individual or entity that has conducted any 
                commercial transaction or financial transaction with an 
                individual or entity described in subparagraph (A);
            (5) additional measures should be adopted by the United 
        States to prevent the diversion of sensitive dual-use 
        technologies to Iran;
            (6) the President should--
                    (A) continue to urge the Government of Iran to 
                respect the internationally recognized human rights and 
                religious freedoms of its citizens;
                    (B) identify the officials of the Government of Iran 
                and other individuals who are responsible for continuing 
                and severe violations of human rights and religious 
                freedom in Iran; and
                    (C) take appropriate measures to respond to such 
                violations, including by--
                          (i) prohibiting officials and other 
                      individuals the President identifies as being 
                      responsible for such violations from entry into 
                      the United States; and
                          (ii) freezing the assets of the officials and 
                      other individuals described in clause (i);
            (7) additional funding should be provided to the Secretary 
        of State to document, collect, and disseminate information about 
        human rights abuses in Iran, including serious abuses that have 
        taken place since the presidential election in Iran on June 12, 
        2009;
            (8) with respect to nongovernmental organizations based in 
        the United States--
                    (A) many of such organizations are essential to 
                promoting human rights and humanitarian goals around the 
                world;
                    (B) it is in the national interest of the United 
                States to allow responsible nongovernmental 
                organizations based in the United States to establish 
                and carry out operations

[[Page 124 STAT. 1316]]

                in Iran to promote civil society and foster humanitarian 
                goodwill among the people of Iran; and
                    (C) the United States should ensure that the 
                organizations described in subparagraph (B) are not 
                unnecessarily hindered from working in Iran to provide 
                humanitarian, human rights, and people-to-people 
                assistance, as appropriate, to the people of Iran;
            (9) the United States should not issue a license pursuant to 
        an agreement for cooperation (as defined in section 11 b. of the 
        Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2014(b))) for the export of 
        nuclear material, facilities, components, or other goods, 
        services, or technology that are or would be subject to such an 
        agreement to a country that is providing similar nuclear 
        material, facilities, components, or other goods, services, or 
        technology to another country that is not in full compliance 
        with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
        including its obligations under the safeguards agreement between 
        that country and the International Atomic Energy Agency, unless 
        the President determines that the provision of such similar 
        nuclear material, facilities, components, or other goods, 
        services, or technology to such other country does not undermine 
        the nonproliferation policies and objectives of the United 
        States; and
            (10) the people of the United States--
                    (A) have feelings of friendship for the people of 
                Iran;
                    (B) regret that developments in recent decades have 
                created impediments to that friendship; and
                    (C) hold the people of Iran, their culture, and 
                their ancient and rich history in the highest esteem.

                        TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ENGAGE IN 
                        CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Financial Action Task Force is an intergovernmental 
        body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and 
        international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist 
        financing.
            (2) Thirty-three countries, plus the European Commission and 
        the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, belong 
        to the Financial Action Task Force. The member countries of the 
        Financial Action Task Force include the United States, Canada, 
        most countries in western Europe, Russia, the People's Republic 
        of China, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil.
            (3) In 2008 the Financial Action Task Force extended its 
        mandate to include addressing ``new and emerging threats such as 
        proliferation financing'', meaning the financing of the 
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and published 
        ``guidance papers'' for members to assist them in implementing 
        various United Nations Security Council resolutions dealing with 
        weapons of mass destruction, including United Nations Security 
        Council Resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), which deal 
        specifically with proliferation by Iran.
            (4) The Financial Action Task Force has repeatedly called on 
        members--
                    (A) to advise financial institutions in their 
                jurisdictions to give special attention to business 
                relationships and transactions with Iran, including 
                Iranian companies and financial institutions;
                    (B) to apply effective countermeasures to protect 
                their financial sectors from risks relating to money 
                laundering and financing of terrorism that emanate from 
                Iran;
                    (C) to protect against correspondent relationships 
                being used by Iran and Iranian companies and financial 
                institutions to bypass or evade countermeasures and 
                risk-mitigation practices; and
                    (D) to take into account risks relating to money 
                laundering and financing of terrorism when considering 
                requests by Iranian financial institutions to open 
                branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdictions.
            (5) At a February 2010 meeting of the Financial Action Task 
        Force, the Task Force called on members to apply countermeasures 
        ``to protect the international financial system from

[[Page 124 STAT. 1332]]

        the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist 
        financing (ML/TF) risks'' emanating from Iran.

    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Imposition of Sanctions on the 
Central Bank of Iran.--Congress--
            (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security 
        Council to impose limitations on transactions involving Iranian 
        financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran; and
            (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to consider 
        immediately using the authority of the President to impose 
        sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran and any other Iranian 
        financial institution engaged in proliferation activities or 
        support of terrorist groups.

    (c) Prohibitions and Conditions With Respect to Certain Accounts 
Held by Foreign Financial Institutions.--

        than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations to

        maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a

        the Secretary finds knowingly engages in an activity described 
        in paragraph (2).
            (2) Activities described.--A foreign financial institution

                      destruction or delivery systems for weapons of 
                      mass destruction; or
                          (ii) to provide support for organizations

        preferable to unilateral sanctions in order to achieve desired
