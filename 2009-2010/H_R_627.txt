                increase and that the increase will terminate not later 
                than 6 months after the date on which it is imposed, if

                time from the obligor during that period; and

        or a method that is no less beneficial to the obligor than one 
        of those methods.

        are--

in the annual percentage rate, fee, or finance charge in accordance with 
section 127(i).''.

rate applicable to a credit card account under an open end consumer 
credit plan, based on factors including the credit risk of the obligor, 
market conditions, or other factors, the creditor shall consider changes 
in such factors in subsequently determining whether to reduce the annual 
percentage rate for such obligor.
    ``(b) Requirements.--With respect to any credit card account under 
an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor shall--

        assess whether such factors have changed (including whether any 
        risk has declined);

        the loss of any time period provided by the creditor within 
        which the obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended 
        without incurring a finance charge, with respect to--
                    ``(A) any balances for days in billing cycles that 
                precede the most recent billing cycle; or

Imposed.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of any credit card account 
        under an open end consumer credit plan under which an over-the-
        limit fee may be imposed by the creditor for any extension of 
        credit in excess of the amount of credit authorized to be 
        extended under such account, no such fee shall be charged, 
        unless the consumer has expressly elected to permit the 
        creditor, with respect to such account, to complete transactions 
        involving the extension of credit under such account in excess 
        of the amount of credit authorized.
            ``(2) Disclosure <<NOTE: Notice.>> by creditor.--No election 
        by a consumer under paragraph (1) shall take effect unless the 
        consumer, before making such election, received a notice from 
        the creditor of any over-the-limit fee in the form and manner, 
        and at the time, determined by the Board. If the consumer makes 
        the election referred to in paragraph (1), the creditor shall 
        provide notice to the consumer of the right to revoke the 
        election, in the form prescribed by the Board, in any periodic 
        statement that includes notice of the imposition of an over-the-
        limit fee during the period covered by the statement.

        may make or revoke the election referred to in paragraph (1) 
        orally, electronically, or in writing, pursuant to regulations 
        prescribed by the Board. The Board shall prescribe regulations 
        to ensure that the same options are available for both making 
        and revoking such election.
            ``(4) Time of election.--A consumer may make the election 
        referred to in paragraph (1) at any time, and such election 
        shall be effective until the election is revoked in the manner 
        prescribed under paragraph (3).

                penalty fees.
            ``(6) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to prohibit a creditor from completing an 
        over-the-limit transaction, provided that a consumer who has not 
        made a valid election under paragraph (1) is not charged an 
        over-the-limit fee for such transaction.
            ``(7) Restriction on fees charged for an over-the-limit 
        transaction.--With respect to a credit card account under an 
        open end consumer credit plan, an over-the-limit fee may be 
        imposed only once during a billing cycle if the credit limit on 
        the account is exceeded, and an over-the-limit fee, with respect 
        to such excess credit, may be imposed only once in each of the 2 
        subsequent billing cycles, unless the consumer has obtained an 
        additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit 
        during any such subsequent cycle or the consumer reduces the 
        outstanding balance below the credit limit as of the end of such 
        billing cycle.

    ``(l) Limit on Fees Related to Method of Payment.--With respect to a 
credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan, the creditor 
may not impose a separate fee to allow the obligor to repay an extension 
of credit or finance charge, whether such repayment is made by mail, 
electronic transfer, telephone authorization, or other means, unless 
such payment involves an expedited service by a service representative 
of the creditor.''.
    (b) Reasonable Penalty Fees.--
            (1) In general.--Chapter 3 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 
        U.S.C. 1661 et seq.), as amended by this Act, is amended by

card issuer may impose with respect to a credit card account under an 
open end consumer credit plan in connection with any omission with 
respect to, or violation of, the cardholder agreement, including any 
late payment fee, over-the-limit fee, or any other penalty fee or 
charge, shall be reasonable and proportional to such omission or 
violation.
    ``(b) Rulemaking Required.--The <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Board, in 
consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of 
Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Director of 
the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union 
Administration Board, shall issue final rules not later than 9 months 
after the date of enactment of this section, to establish standards for 
assessing whether the amount of any penalty fee or charge described 
under subsection (a) is reasonable and proportional to the omission or 
violation to which the fee or charge relates. 
Subsection <<NOTE: Effective date.>> (a) shall become effective 15 
months after the date of enactment of this section.

    ``(c) Considerations.--In issuing rules required by this section, 
the Board shall consider--

        or violation;
            ``(2) the deterrence of such omission or violation by the 
        cardholder;
            ``(3) the conduct of the cardholder; and
            ``(4) such other factors as the Board may deem necessary or

SEC. 501. STUDY AND REPORT ON INTERCHANGE FEES.

    (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
(in this section referred to as the ``Comptroller'') shall conduct a 
study on use of credit by consumers, interchange fees, and their effects 
on consumers and merchants.
    (b) Subjects for Review.--In conducting the study required by this 
section, the Comptroller shall review--
            (1) the extent to which interchange fees are required to be 
        disclosed to consumers and merchants, whether merchants are 
        restricted from disclosing interchange or merchant discount 
        fees, and how such fees are overseen by the Federal banking 
        agencies or other regulators;
            (2) the ways in which the interchange system affects the 
        ability of merchants of varying size to negotiate pricing with 
        card associations and banks;
            (3) the costs and factors incorporated into interchange 
        fees, such as advertising, bonus miles, and rewards, how such 
        costs and factors vary among cards;
            (4) the consequences of the undisclosed nature of 
        interchange fees on merchants and consumers with regard to 
        prices charged for goods and services;
            (5) how merchant discount fees compare to the credit losses 
        and other costs that merchants incur to operate their own credit 
        networks or store cards;
            (6) the extent to which the rules of payment card networks 
        and their policies regarding interchange fees are accessible to 
        merchants;
            (7) other jurisdictions where the central bank has regulated 
        interchange fees and the impact on retail prices to consumers in 
        such jurisdictions;
            (8) whether and to what extent merchants are permitted to 
        discount for cash; and

[[Page 123 STAT. 1755]]

            (9) the extent to which interchange fees allow smaller 
        financial institutions and credit unions to offer payment cards 
        and compete against larger financial institutions.

    (c) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller shall submit a report to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the 
Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives

                and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to authorize the 
        Federal Trade Commission to promulgate a rule with respect to an 
        entity that is not subject to enforcement of the Federal Trade

        means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as

    ``(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (6), in any case in which 
the attorney general of a State has reason to believe that an interest 
of the residents of that State has been or is threatened or adversely 
affected by the engagement of any person subject to a rule prescribed

SEC. 512. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1a-7b.>> PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM 
                        VIOLENT CRIME.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that 
        ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
        infringed''.
            (2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, provides that ``except as otherwise provided in 
        this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska 
        regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a 
        weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) 
        Using a weapon, trap or net''.

[[Page 123 STAT. 1765]]

            (3) Section 27.42 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, 
        provides that, except in special circumstances, citizens of the 
        United States may not ``possess, use, or transport firearms on 
        national wildlife refuges'' of the United States Fish and 
        Wildlife Service.
            (4) The regulations described in paragraphs (2) and (3) 
        prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from 
        exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while 
        at units of--
                    (A) the National Park System; and
                    (B) the National Wildlife Refuge System.
            (5) The existence of different laws relating to the 
        transportation and possession of firearms at different units of 
        the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System 
        entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at units of the National 
        Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System.
            (6) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations 
        relating to the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens 
        in units of the National Park System and National Wildlife 
        Refuge System that went into effect on January 9, 2009--
                    (A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District 
                Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary 
                injunction with respect to the implementation and 
                enforcement of the new regulations; and
                    (B) the new regulations--
                          (i) are under review by the administration; 
                      and
                          (ii) may be altered.
            (7) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to 
        ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again
