SEC. 2. REDUCING LEAD IN DRINKING WATER.

    (a) In General.--Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 
U.S.C. 300g-6) is amended--
            (1) by adding at the end of subsection (a) the following:
            ``(4) Exemptions.--The prohibitions in paragraphs (1) and 
        (3) shall not apply to--
                    ``(A) pipes, pipe fittings, plumbing fittings, or 
                fixtures, including backflow preventers, that are used 
                exclusively for nonpotable services such as 
                manufacturing, industrial processing, irrigation, 
                outdoor watering, or any other uses where the water is 
                not anticipated to be used for human consumption; or
                    ``(B) toilets, bidets, urinals, fill valves, 
                flushometer valves, tub fillers, shower valves, service 
                saddles, or water distribution main gate valves that are 
                2 inches in diameter or larger.''; and
            (2) by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:

    ``(d) Definition of Lead Free.--
            ``(1) In general.--For the purposes of this section, the 
        term `lead free' means--
                    ``(A) not containing more than 0.2 percent lead when 
                used with respect to solder and flux; and
                    ``(B) not more than a weighted average of 0.25 
                percent lead when used with respect to the wetted 
                surfaces of pipes, pipe fittings, plumbing fittings, and 
                fixtures.
            ``(2) Calculation.--The weighted average lead content of a 
        pipe, pipe fitting, plumbing fitting, or fixture shall be 
        calculated by using the following formula: For each wetted 
        component, the percentage of lead in the component shall be 
        multiplied by the ratio of the wetted surface area of that 
        component to the total wetted surface area of the entire product 
        to arrive at the weighted percentage of lead of the component. 
        The weighted percentage of lead of each wetted component shall 
        be added together, and the sum of these weighted percentages 
        shall constitute the weighted average lead content of the 
        product. The lead content of the material used to produce

[[Page 124 STAT. 4132]]

        wetted components shall be used to determine compliance with 
        paragraph (1)(B). For lead content of materials that are 
        provided as a range, the maximum content of the range shall be 
        used.''.

    (b) <<NOTE: 42 USC 300g-6 note.>>  Effective Date.--The provisions 
of subsections (a)(4) and (d) of section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water 
Act, as added by this section, apply beginning on the day that is 36 
months after the date of the enactment of this Act.

    Approved January 4, 2011.
