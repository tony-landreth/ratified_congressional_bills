  Proclaiming Casimir Pulaski to be an honorary citizen of the United

Whereas Casimir Pulaski was a Polish military officer who fought on the 
    side of the American colonists against the British in the American 
    Revolutionary War;

    accept Casimir Pulaski as a volunteer in the American Cavalry and 
    said that Pulaski was ``renowned throughout Europe for the courage 
    and bravery he displayed in defense of his country's freedom'';

Whereas, after arriving in America, Casimir Pulaski wrote to General 
    Washington, ``I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve 
    it, and to live or die for it.'';

Whereas the first military engagement of Casimir Pulaski with the 
    British was on September 11, 1777, at the Battle of Brandywine, and 
    his courageous charge in this engagement averted a disastrous defeat 
    of the American Cavalry and saved the life of George Washington;

Whereas, on September 15, 1777, George Washington elevated Casimir 
    Pulaski to the rank of Brigadier General of the American Cavalry;

Whereas Casimir Pulaski formed the Pulaski Cavalry Legion, and in 
    February 1779, this legion ejected the British occupiers from 
    Charleston, South Carolina;

Whereas, in October 1779, Casimir Pulaski mounted an assault against 
    British forces in Savannah, Georgia;

Whereas, on the morning of October 9, 1779, Casimir Pulaski was mortally 
    wounded and was taken aboard the American ship USS Wasp, where he 
    died at sea on October 11, 1779;

Whereas, before the end of 1779, the Continental Congress resolved that 
    a monument should be erected in honor of Casimir Pulaski;

Whereas, in 1825, General Lafayette laid the cornerstone for the Casimir 
    Pulaski monument in Savannah, Georgia; and

Whereas, in 1929, Congress passed a resolution recognizing October 11 of 
    each year as Pulaski Day in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
