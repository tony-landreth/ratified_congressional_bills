                developed under this section are compatible with global 
                tracing systems, as appropriate; and
                    (C) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  consult with a diverse 
                and broad range of experts and stakeholders, including 
                representatives of the food industry, agricultural 
                producers, and nongovernmental organizations that 
                represent the interests of consumers.

    (c) Product Tracing System.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Agriculture, shall, as appropriate, establish within the 
Food and Drug Administration a product tracing system to receive 
information that improves the capacity of the Secretary to effectively 
and rapidly track and trace food that is in the United States or offered 
for import into the United States. Prior to the establishment of such 
product tracing system, the Secretary shall examine the results of 
applicable pilot projects and shall ensure that the activities of such 
system are adequately supported by the results of such pilot projects.
    (d) Additional Recordkeeping Requirements for High Risk Foods.--
            (1) In general. <<NOTE: Deadline. Publication. Notice.>> --
        In order to rapidly and effectively identify recipients of a 
        food to prevent or mitigate a foodborne illness outbreak and to 
        address credible threats of serious adverse health consequences 
        or death to humans or animals as a result of such food being 
        adulterated under section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act or misbranded under section 403(w) of such Act, not 
        later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary shall publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to 
        establish recordkeeping requirements, in addition to the 
        requirements under section 414 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350c) and subpart J of part 1 of title 
        21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), 
        for facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods 
        that the Secretary designates under paragraph (2) as high-risk 
        foods. The Secretary shall set an appropriate effective date of 
        such additional requirements for foods designated as high risk 
        that takes into account the length of time necessary to comply 
        with such requirements. Such requirements shall--
                    (A) relate only to information that is reasonably 
                available and appropriate;

                imposing additional recordkeeping requirements outweigh 
                the cost of compliance with such requirements;
                    (E) be scale-appropriate and practicable for 
                facilities of varying sizes and capabilities with 
                respect to costs and recordkeeping burdens, and not 
                require the creation and maintenance of duplicate 
                records where the information is contained in other 
                company records kept in the normal course of business;

[[Page 124 STAT. 3932]]

                    (F) minimize the number of different recordkeeping 
                requirements for facilities that handle more than 1 type 
                of food;
                    (G) to the extent practicable, not require a 
                facility to change business systems to comply with such 
                requirements;
                    (H) allow any person subject to this subsection to 
                maintain records required under this subsection at a 
                central or reasonably accessible location provided that 
                such records can be made available to the Secretary not 
                later than 24 hours after the Secretary requests such 
                records; and
                    (I) include a process by which the Secretary may 
                issue a waiver of the requirements under this subsection 
                if the Secretary determines that such requirements would 
                result in an economic hardship for an individual 
                facility or a type of facility;
                    (J) be commensurate with the known safety risks of 
                the designated food;
                    (K) take into account international trade 
                obligations;
                    (L) not require--
                          (i) a full pedigree, or a record of the 
                      complete previous distribution history of the food 
                      from the point of origin of such food;
                          (ii) records of recipients of a food beyond 
                      the immediate subsequent recipient of such food; 
                      or
                          (iii) product tracking to the case level by 
                      persons subject to such requirements; and
                    (M) include a process by which the Secretary may 
                remove a high-risk food designation developed under 
                paragraph (2) for a food or type of food.
            (2) Designation of high-risk foods.--
                    (A) In general. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> --Not later than 
                1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
                thereafter as the Secretary determines necessary, the 
                Secretary shall designate high-risk foods for which the 
                additional recordkeeping requirements described in 
                paragraph (1) are appropriate and necessary to protect 
                the public health. Each such designation shall be based 
                on--
                          (i) the known safety risks of a particular 
                      food, including the history and severity of 
                      foodborne illness outbreaks attributed to such 
                      food, taking into consideration foodborne illness 
                      data collected by the Centers for Disease Control 
                      and Prevention;
                          (ii) the likelihood that a particular food has 
                      a high potential risk for microbiological or 
                      chemical contamination or would support the growth 
                      of pathogenic microorganisms due to the nature of 
                      the food or the processes used to produce such 
                      food;
                          (iii) the point in the manufacturing process 
                      of the food where contamination is most likely to 
                      occur;
                          (iv) the likelihood of contamination and steps 
                      taken during the manufacturing process to reduce 
                      the possibility of contamination;
                          (v) the likelihood that consuming a particular 
                      food will result in a foodborne illness due to 
                      contamination of the food; and

[[Page 124 STAT. 3933]]

                          (vi) the likely or known severity, including 
                      health and economic impacts, of a foodborne 
                      illness attributed to a particular food.
                    (B) List of high-risk foods. <<NOTE: List. Web 
                posting.>> --At the time the Secretary promulgates the 
                final rules under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
                publish the list of the foods designated under 
                subparagraph (A) as high-risk foods on the Internet 
                website of the Food and Drug 
                Administration. <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
                publication. Notice.>>  The Secretary may update the 
                list to designate new high-risk foods and to remove 
                foods that are no longer deemed to be high-risk foods, 
                provided that each such update to the list is consistent 
                with the requirements of this subsection and notice of 
                such update is published in the Federal Register.
            (3) Protection of sensitive information.--In promulgating 
        regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall take 
        appropriate measures to ensure that there are effective 
        procedures to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of any trade 
        secret or confidential information that is obtained by the 
        Secretary pursuant to this section, including periodic risk 
        assessment and planning to prevent unauthorized release and 
        controls to--
                    (A) prevent unauthorized reproduction of trade 
                secret or confidential information;
                    (B) prevent unauthorized access to trade secret or 
                confidential information; and
                    (C) maintain records with respect to access by any 
                person to trade secret or confidential information 
                maintained by the agency.
            (4) Public input.--During the comment period in the notice 
        of proposed rulemaking under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
        conduct not less than 3 public meetings in diverse geographical 
        areas of the United States to provide persons in different 
        regions an opportunity to comment.
            (5) Retention of records.--Except as otherwise provided in 
        this subsection, the Secretary may require that a facility 
        retain records under this subsection for not more than 2 years, 
        taking into consideration the risk of spoilage, loss of value, 
        or loss of palatability of the applicable food when determining 
        the appropriate timeframes.
            (6) Limitations.--
                    (A) Farm to school programs.--In establishing 
                requirements under this subsection, the Secretary shall, 
                in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, 
                consider the impact of requirements on farm to school or 
                farm to institution programs of the Department of 
                Agriculture and other farm to school and farm to 
                institution programs outside such agency, and shall 
                modify the requirements under this subsection, as 
                appropriate, with respect to such programs so that the 
                requirements do not place undue burdens on farm to 
                school or farm to institution programs.
                    (B) Identity-preserved labels with respect to farm 
                sales of food that is produced and packaged on a farm.--
                The requirements under this subsection shall not apply 
                to a food that is produced and packaged on a farm if--

[[Page 124 STAT. 3934]]

                          (i) the packaging of the food maintains the 
                      integrity of the product and prevents subsequent 
                      contamination or alteration of the product; and
                          (ii) the labeling of the food includes the 
                      name, complete address (street address, town, 
                      State, country, and zip or other postal code), and 
                      business phone number of the farm, unless the 
                      Secretary waives the requirement to include a 
                      business phone number of the farm, as appropriate, 
                      in order to accommodate a religious belief of the 
                      individual in charge of such farm.
                    (C) Fishing vessels.--The requirements under this 
                subsection with respect to a food that is produced

                determined by the relevant authority to have been an 
                error;

        than 90 days after the conclusion of such review, the Secretary 
        of Agriculture shall conduct a study of the feasibility of 
        implementing a farmer indemnification program to provide 
        restitution to agricultural producers for losses sustained as a 
        result of a mandatory recall of an agricultural commodity by a

other individuals duly designated by the Secretary, upon request, to 
inspect such factory, warehouse, or other establishment. For purposes of

        party auditors and audit agents of such auditors meet such
