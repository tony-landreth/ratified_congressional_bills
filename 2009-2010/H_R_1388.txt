    (b) Feasibility Study for a System of Criminal History Checks for 
Employees and Volunteers.--
            (1) Feasibility study on efficiency and effectiveness 
        regarding criminal history check.--The Attorney General of the 
        United States shall conduct a study that shall examine, to the 
        extent discernible and as of the date of the study, the 
        following:
                    (A) The state of criminal history checks (including 
                the use of fingerprint collection) at the State and 
                local level, including--
                          (i) the available infrastructure for 
                      conducting criminal history checks;
                          (ii) the State system capacities to conduct 
                      such criminal history checks; and
                          (iii) the time required for each State to 
                      process an individual's fingerprints for a 
                      national criminal history background check through 
                      the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from the time 
                      of fingerprint collection to the submission to the 
                      Federal Bureau of Investigation.
                    (B) The likelihood that each State would participate 
                in a nationwide system of criminal history checks to 
                provide information regarding participants to entities 
                receiving assistance under the national service laws.
                    (C) The number of participants that would require a 
                fingerprint-based national criminal history background 
                check under the national service laws.
                    (D) The impact of the national service laws on the 
                Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System 
                of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in terms of 
                capacity and impact on other users of the system, 
                including the effect on the work practices and staffing 
                levels of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
                    (E) The fees charged by the Federal Bureau of 
                Investigation, States, local agencies, and private 
                companies to collect and process fingerprints and 
                conduct criminal history checks.
                    (F) The existence of model or best practice programs 
                regarding conducting criminal history checks that could 
                easily be expanded and duplicated in other States.

[[Page 123 STAT. 1543]]

                    (G) The extent to which private companies are 
                currently performing criminal history checks, and the 
                possibility of using private companies in the future to 
                perform any of the criminal history check process, 
                including the collection and transmission of 
                fingerprints and fitness determinations.
                    (H) The cost of development and operation of the 
                technology and the infrastructure necessary to establish 
                a nationwide fingerprint-based and other criminal 
                background check system.
                    (I) The extent of State participation in the 
                procedures for background checks under the National 
                Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.).
                    (J) The extent to which States provide access to 
                nationwide criminal history checks to organizations that 
                serve children.
                    (K) The extent to which States permit volunteers and 
                other individuals to appeal adverse fitness 
                determinations, and whether similar procedures are 
                required at the Federal level.
                    (L) Any privacy concerns that may arise from 
                nationwide criminal background checks for participants.
                    (M) Any other information determined relevant by the 
                Attorney General.
            (2) Interim report.--Based on the findings of the study 
        under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall, not later than 
        6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, submit to 
        the appropriate committees of Congress an interim report, which 
        may include recommendations regarding criminal history checks 
        for individuals that seek to volunteer with organizations that 
        work with children, the elderly, or individuals with 
        disabilities.
            (3) Final report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit to the 
        Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and to the 
        Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Education and 
        Labor of the House of Representatives, a final report including 
        recommendations regarding criminal history checks for 
        participants under the national service laws, which may 
        include--
                    (A) a proposal for grants to States to develop or 
                improve programs to collect fingerprints and perform 
                criminal history checks for individuals that seek to 
                volunteer with organizations that work with children, 
                the elderly, or individuals with disabilities; and
                    (B) recommendations for amendments to the National 
                Child Protection Act of 1993 and the Volunteers for 
                Children Act so that entities receiving assistance under 
                the national service laws can promptly and affordably 
                conduct nationwide criminal history background checks on 
                their employees and volunteers.

SEC. 6102. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) President John F. Kennedy said, ``The raising of 
        extraordinarily large sums of money, given voluntarily and 
        freely by millions of our fellow Americans, is a unique American 
        tradition . . . Philanthropy, charity, giving voluntarily and 
        freely . . . call it what you like, but it is truly a jewel of 
        an American tradition''.
            (2) Americans gave more than $300,000,000,000 to charitable 
        causes in 2007, an amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the 
        gross domestic product.
            (3) The vast majority of those donations, roughly 75 percent 
        or $229,000,000,000, came from individuals.
            (4) Studies have shown that Americans give far more to 
        charity than the people of any other industrialized nation--more 
        than twice as much, measured as a share of gross domestic 
        product, than the citizens of Great Britain, and 10 times more 
        than the citizens of France.
            (5) 7 out of 10 American households donate to charities to 
        support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, health 
        care, and environmental goals.
            (6) These charities provide innumerable valuable public 
        services to society's most vulnerable citizens during difficult 
        economic times.
            (7) Congress has provided incentives through the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage charitable giving by allowing 
        individuals to deduct contributions made to tax-exempt 
        charities.

[[Page 123 STAT. 1601]]

            (8) 41,000,000 American households, constituting 86 percent 
        of taxpayers who itemize deductions, took advantage of this 
        deduction to give to the charities of their choice.

    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
Congress should preserve the income tax deduction for charitable 
contributions through the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and look for 
additional ways to encourage charitable giving.

    Approved April 21, 2009.
