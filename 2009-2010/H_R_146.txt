    Subtitle B--Prehistoric <<NOTE: New Mexico. 16 USC 431 note.>>  
Trackways National Monument
SEC. 2101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in 1987, a major deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized 
        footprint megatrackways was discovered in the Robledo Mountains 
        in southern New Mexico;
            (2) the trackways contain footprints of numerous amphibians, 
        reptiles, and insects (including previously unknown species), 
        plants, and petrified wood dating back approximately 280,000,000 
        years, which collectively provide new opportunities to 
        understand animal behaviors and environments from a time 
        predating the dinosaurs;
            (3) title III of Public Law 101-578 (104 Stat. 2860)--
                    (A) provided interim protection for the site at 
                which the trackways were discovered; and
                    (B) directed the Secretary of the Interior to--
                          (i) prepare a study assessing the significance 
                      of the site; and
                          (ii) based on the study, provide 
                      recommendations for protection of the 
                      paleontological resources at the site;
            (4) the Bureau of Land Management completed the Paleozoic 
        Trackways Scientific Study Report in 1994, which characterized 
        the site as containing ``the most scientifically significant 
        Early Permian tracksites'' in the world;
            (5) despite the conclusion of the study and the 
        recommendations for protection, the site remains unprotected and 
        many irreplaceable trackways specimens have been lost to 
        vandalism or theft; and
            (6) designation of the trackways site as a National Monument 
        would protect the unique fossil resources for present and future 
        generations while allowing for public education and continued 
        scientific research opportunities.

                                    (I) the Secretary determines, upon 
                                adjudication of the water rights by the 
                                Colorado Water Conservation Board, that 
                                the Board holds water rights sufficient 
                                in priority, amount, and timing to

                                full exercise, protection, and 
                                enforcement of the State water rights 
                                within the Wilderness to reliably 
                                fulfill the purposes of the Wilderness.
                          (ii) Adjudication.--If the Secretary 
                      determines that the provisions of clause (i) have

                      exercise any Federal water rights required to 
                      fulfill the purposes of the Wilderness in

                water rights obtained under subparagraph (E) to such a 
                degree that the Secretary determines that water rights 
                held by the State are insufficient to fulfill the 
                purposes of the Wilderness, the Secretary shall 
                adjudicate and exercise Federal water rights required to 
                fulfill the purposes of the Wilderness in accordance 
                with subparagraph (B).

                act to exercise and enforce the water rights described 
                in subparagraph (E) if the Secretary determines that--
                          (i) the State is not exercising its water 
                      rights consistent with subparagraph (E)(i)(I); or
                          (ii) the agreement described in subparagraph 
                      (E)(i)(II) is not fulfilled or complied with 
                      sufficiently to fulfill the purposes of the 
                      Wilderness.

            (2) systematic data-gathering with respect to, and research 
        and development of, the water resources of the United States 
        will help ensure the continued existence of sufficient

                    (E) the protection of aquatic ecosystems;
            (3) global climate change poses a significant challenge to 
        the protection and use of the water resources of the United 
        States due to an increased uncertainty with respect to the 
        timing, form, and geographical distribution of precipitation, 
        which may have a substantial effect on the supplies of water for 
        agricultural, hydroelectric power, industrial, domestic supply, 
        and environmental needs;
            (4) although States bear the primary responsibility and 
        authority for managing the water resources of the United States, 
        the Federal Government should support the States, as well as 
        regional, local, and tribal governments, by carrying out--

                of water in the United States;
            (5) Federal agencies that conduct water management and 
        related activities have a responsibility--
                    (A) to take a lead role in assessing risks to the 
                water resources of the United States (including risks 
                posed by global climate change); and
                    (B) to develop strategies--
                          (i) to mitigate the potential impacts of each 
                      risk described in subparagraph (A); and

[[Page 123 STAT. 1330]]

                          (ii) to help ensure that the long-term water 
                      resources management of the United States is 
                      sustainable and will ensure sustainable quantities 
                      of water;
            (6) it is critical to continue and expand research and 
        monitoring efforts--
                    (A) to improve the understanding of the variability 
                of the water cycle; and
                    (B) to provide basic information necessary--
                          (i) to manage and efficiently use the water 
                      resources of the United States; and
                          (ii) to identify new supplies of water that 
                      are capable of being reclaimed; and
            (7) the study of water use is vital--
                    (A) to the understanding of the impacts of human 
                activity on water and ecological resources; and
                    (B) to the assessment of whether available surface 
                and groundwater supplies will be available to meet the

                River required under

[[Page 123 STAT. 1352]]

                the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
                seq.) as a result of the Interim Flows.
            (2) Conditions for release.--The Secretary is authorized to 
        release Interim Flows to the extent that such flows would not--
                    (A) impede or delay completion of the measures 
                specified in Paragraph 11(a) of the Settlement; or
                    (B) exceed existing downstream channel capacities.
            (3) Seepage impacts.--The Secretary shall reduce Interim 
        Flows to the extent necessary to address any material adverse 
        impacts to third parties from groundwater seepage caused by such 
        flows that the Secretary identifies based on the monitoring 
        program of the Secretary.
            (4) <<NOTE: Evaluation.>>  Temporary fish barrier program.--
        The Secretary, in consultation with the California Department of 
        Fish and Game, shall evaluate the effectiveness of the Hills 
        Ferry barrier in preventing the unintended upstream migration of 
        anadromous fish in the San Joaquin River and any false migratory 
        pathways. If that evaluation determines that any such migration 
        past the barrier is caused by the introduction of the Interim 
        Flows and that the presence of such fish will result in the 
        imposition of additional regulatory actions against third 
        parties, the Secretary is authorized to assist the Department of 
        Fish and Game in making improvements to the barrier. From 
        funding made available in accordance with section 10009, if 
        third parties along the San Joaquin River south of its 
        confluence with the Merced River are required to install fish 
        screens or fish bypass facilities due to the release of Interim 
        Flows in order to comply with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
        (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Secretary shall bear the costs of 
        the installation of such screens or facilities if such costs 
        would be borne by the Federal Government under section 
        10009(a)(3), except to the extent that such costs are already or 
        are further willingly borne by the State of California or by the 
        third parties.

    (i) Funding Availability.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  In general.--Funds shall be 
        collected in the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund through 
        October 1, 2019, and thereafter, with substantial amounts 
        available through October 1, 2019, pursuant to section 10009 for 
        implementation of the Settlement and parts I and III, 
        including--
                    (A) $88,000,000, to be available without further 
                appropriation pursuant to section 10009(c)(2);

                appropriated, including the charges required under 
                section 10007 and an estimated $20,000,000 from the CVP 
                Restoration Fund pursuant to section 10009(b)(2); and
                    (C) an aggregate commitment of at least $200,000,000 
                by the State of California.
            (2) Additional amounts.--Substantial additional amounts from 
        the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund shall become available 
        without further appropriation after October 1, 2019, pursuant to 
        section 10009(c)(2).
            (3) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection limits 
        the availability of funds authorized for appropriation pursuant 
        to section 10009(b) or 10203(c).

                                otherwise, as to whether the expansion 
                                of Reach 4B would be the preferable 
                                means to achieve the Restoration Goal as 
                                provided in the Settlement, including 
                                how different factors were assessed such

[[Page 123 STAT. 1358]]

                                    (III) The Secretary's plan for 
                                funding the costs of expanding Reach 4B 
                                or any alternative route selected, 
                                whether by existing Federal funds 
                                provided under this subtitle, by non-
                                Federal funds, by future Federal 
                                appropriations, or some combination of 
                                such sources.
                    (B) Determination required.--The Secretary shall, to 
                the extent feasible, make the determination in 
                subparagraph (A) prior to undertaking any substantial 
                construction work to increase capacity in reach 4B.
            (3) Costs.--If the Secretary's estimated Federal cost for 
        expanding reach 4B in paragraph (2), in light of the Secretary's 
        funding plan set out in that paragraph, would exceed the 
        remaining Federal funding authorized by this part (including all 
        funds reallocated, all funds dedicated, and all new funds 
        authorized by this part and separate from all commitments of 
        State and other non-Federal funds and in-kind commitments), then 
        before the Secretary commences actual construction work in reach 
        4B (other than planning, design, feasibility, or other 
        preliminary measures) to expand capacity to 4500 cubic feet per 
        second to implement this Settlement, Congress must have 
        increased the applicable authorization ceiling provided by this 
        part in an amount at least sufficient to cover the higher 
        estimated Federal costs.

                be repaid in not more than 5 years after notification of 
                the allocation if such amount is a result of a 
                collective annual allocation of capital costs to the 
                contractors exercising contract conversions under this 
                subsection of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is 
                $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be repaid as 
                provided by applicable Reclamation law, provided that 
                the reference to the amount of $5,000,000 shall not be a 
                precedent in any other context;
                    (C) provide that power revenues will not be 
                available to aid in repayment of construction costs 
                allocated to irrigation under the contract; and
                    (D) conform to the Settlement and this part and 
                shall continue so long as the contractor pays applicable 
                charges, consistent with subsection (c)(2) and 
                applicable law.
            (4) All such contracts entered into pursuant to paragraph 
        (2) shall--
                    (A) require the repayment in lump sum of the 
                remaining amount of construction costs identified in the 
                most current version of the Central Valley Project 
                Schedule of Municipal and Industrial Water Rates, as 
                adjusted to reflect payments not reflected in such 
                schedule, and properly assignable for ultimate return by 
                the contractor, no later than January 31, 
                2014. <<NOTE: Cost estimate.>>  An estimate of the 
                remaining amount of construction costs as of January 31, 
                2014, as adjusted, shall be provided by the Secretary to 
                each contractor no later than June 30, 2013;
                    (B) require that, notwithstanding subsection (c)(2), 
                construction costs or other capitalized costs incurred 
                after the effective date of the contract or not 
                reflected in the schedule referenced in subparagraph 
                (A), and properly assignable to such contractor, shall 
                be repaid in not more than 5 years after notification of 
                the allocation if such amount is a result of a 
                collective annual allocation of capital costs to the 
                contractors exercising contract conversions under this 
                subsection of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is 
                $5,000,000 or greater, such cost shall be repaid

[[Page 123 STAT. 1360]]

                as provided by applicable Reclamation law, provided that 
                the reference to the amount of $5,000,000 shall not be a 
                precedent in any other context; and
                    (C) conform to the Settlement and this part and 
                shall continue so long as the contractor pays applicable 
                charges, consistent with subsection (c)(2) and 
                applicable law.

    (b) Final Adjustment.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) 
shall be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary upon completion of the construction of the Central Valley 
Project. In the event that the final cost allocation indicates that the 
costs properly assignable to the contractor are greater than what has 
been paid by the contractor, the contractor shall be obligated to pay 
the remaining allocated costs. The term of such additional repayment 
contract shall be no less than 1 year and no more than 10 years, 
however, mutually agreeable provisions regarding the rate of repayment 
of such amount may be developed by the parties. In the event that the 
final cost allocation indicates that the costs properly assignable to 
the contractor are less than what the contractor has paid, the Secretary 
is authorized and directed to credit such overpayment as an offset 
against any outstanding or future obligation of the contractor.
    (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--
            (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under 
        subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's 
        compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment of 
        the construction costs as provided in subsection (a)(3)(A), the 
        provisions of section 213(a) and (b) of the Reclamation Reform 
        Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) shall apply to lands in such 
        district.
            (2) <<NOTE: Waiver. Payments.>>  Notwithstanding any 
        repayment obligation under paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of 
        subsection (a), or subsection (b), upon a contractor's 
        compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment of 
        the construction costs as provided in paragraphs (3)(A) and 
        (4)(A) of subsection (a), the Secretary shall waive the pricing 
        provisions of section 3405(d) of the Reclamation Projects 
        Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) 
        for such contractor, provided that such contractor shall 
        continue to pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and 
        other charges applicable to such repayment contracts pursuant to 
        the then-current rate-setting policy and applicable law.
            (3) Provisions of the Settlement applying to Friant 
        Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term water service 
        contracts shall also apply to contracts executed pursuant to 
        this section.

    (d) Reduction of Charge for Those Contracts Converted Pursuant to 
Subsection (a)(1).--
            (1) At the time all payments by the contractor required by 
        subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed, the Secretary shall 
        reduce the charge mandated in section 10007(1) of this part, 
        from 2020 through 2039, to offset the financing costs as defined 
        in section 10010(d)(3). The reduction shall be calculated at the 
        time all payments by the contractor required by subsection 
        (a)(3)(A) have been completed. The calculation shall remain 
        fixed from 2020 through 2039 and shall be based upon anticipated 
        average annual water deliveries, as mutually agreed upon by the 
        Secretary and the contractor, for the period from

[[Page 123 STAT. 1361]]

        2020 through 2039, and the amounts of such reductions shall be 
        discounted using the Treasury Rate; provided, that such charge 
        shall not be reduced to less than $4.00 per acre foot of project 
        water delivered; <<NOTE: Deadline. Determination.>>  provided 
        further, that such reduction shall be implemented annually 
        unless the Secretary determines, based on the availability of 
        other monies, that the charges mandated in section 10007(1) are 
        otherwise needed to cover ongoing federal costs of the 
        Settlement, including any federal operation and maintenance 
        costs of facilities that the Secretary determines are needed to 
        implement the Settlement. If the Secretary determines that such 
        charges are necessary to cover such ongoing federal costs, the 
        Secretary shall, instead of making the reduction in such 
        charges, reduce the contractor's operation and maintenance 
        obligation by an equivalent amount, and such amount shall not be 
        recovered by the United States from any Central Valley Project 
        contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the obligation 
        of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a transfer 
        agreement with a non-federal operating entity.
            (2) <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  If the calculated reduction 
        in paragraph (1), taking into consideration the minimum amount 
        required, does not result in the contractor offsetting its 
        financing costs, the Secretary is authorized and directed to 
        reduce, after October 1, 2019, any outstanding or future 
        obligations of the contractor to the Bureau of Reclamation, 
        other than the charge assessed and collected under section 
        3407(d) of Public law 102-575, by the amount of such deficiency, 
        with such amount indexed to 2020 using the Treasury Rate and 
        such amount shall not be recovered by the United States from any 
        Central Valley Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall 
        affect the obligation of the contractor to make payments 
        pursuant to a transfer agreement with a non-Federal operating 
        entity.
            (3) Financing costs, for the purposes of this subsection, 
        shall be computed as the difference of the net present value of 
        the construction cost identified in subsection (a)(3)(A) using 
        the full Treasury Rate as compared to using one half of the 
        Treasury Rate and applying those rates against a calculated 
        average annual capital repayment through 2030.
            (4) <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  Effective in 2040, the charge 
        shall revert to the amount called for in section 10007(1) of 
        this part.
            (5) <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  For purposes of this section, 
        ``Treasury Rate'' shall be defined as the 20 year Constant 
        Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate published by the United States 
        Department of the Treasury as of October 1, 2010.

    (e) Satisfaction of Certain Provisions.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadlines. Notice.>>  In general.--Upon the 
        first release of Interim Flows or Restoration Flows, pursuant to 
        paragraphs 13 or 15 of the Settlement, any short- or long-term 
        agreement, to which 1 or more long-term Friant Division, Hidden 
        Unit, or Buchanan Unit contractor that converts its contract 
        pursuant to subsection (a) is a party, providing for the 
        transfer or exchange of water not released as Interim Flows or 
        Restoration Flows shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of 
        subsection 3405(a)(1)(A) and (I) of the Reclamation Projects 
        Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) 
        without the further concurrence of the Secretary as to 
        compliance with said subsections if the contractor provides, not 
        later than 90

[[Page 123 STAT. 1362]]

        days before commencement of any such transfer or exchange for a 
        period in excess of 1 year, and not later than 30 days before 
        commencement of any proposed transfer or exchange with duration 
        of less than 1 year, written notice to the Secretary stating how 
        the proposed transfer or exchange is intended to reduce, avoid, 
        or mitigate impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim 
        Flows or Restoration Flows or is intended to otherwise 
        facilitate the Water Management Goal, as described in the 
        Settlement. <<NOTE: Public information.>>  The Secretary shall 
        promptly make such notice publicly available.
            (2) Determination of reductions to water deliveries.--Water 
        transferred or exchanged under an agreement that meets the terms 
        of this subsection shall not be counted as a replacement or an 
        offset for purposes of determining reductions to water 
        deliveries to any Friant Division long-term contractor except as 
        provided in paragraph 16(b) of the Settlement. The 
        Secretary <<NOTE: Deadline. Public information.>>  shall, at 
        least annually, make publicly available a compilation of the 
        number of transfer or exchange agreements exercising the 
        provisions of this subsection to reduce, avoid, or mitigate 
        impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim Flows or 
        Restoration Flows or to facilitate the Water Management Goal, as 
        well as the volume of water transferred or exchanged under such 
        agreements.
            (3) State law.--Nothing in this subsection alters State law 
        or permit conditions, including any applicable geographical 
        restrictions on the place of use of water transferred or 
        exchanged pursuant to this subsection.

    (f) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--Implementation of 
the provisions of this section shall not alter the repayment obligation 
of any other long-term water service or repayment contractor receiving 
water from the Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would 
otherwise have been properly assignable to the Friant contractors absent 
this section, including operations and maintenance costs, construction 
costs, or other capitalized costs incurred after the date of enactment 
of this Act, to other such contractors.
    (g) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the right of any Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or 
Buchanan Unit long-term contractor to use a particular type of financing 
to make the payments required in paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(A) of 
subsection (a).
SEC. 10011. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the 
Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation regarding 
restoration of the San Joaquin River and the reintroduction of the 
California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon is a unique and 
unprecedented circumstance that requires clear expressions of 
Congressional intent regarding how the provisions of the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the 
goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the successful 
reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.
    (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California Central 
Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be reintroduced in the San 
Joaquin River below Friant Dam pursuant to section

[[Page 123 STAT. 1363]]

10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the 
Settlement, provided that the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit 
for the reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook 
salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(A)).
    (c) Final Rule.--
            (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this 
        subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or entities 
        diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable State and 
        Federal laws and shall include Central Valley Project 
        contractors outside of the Friant Division of the Central Valley 
        Project and the State Water Project.
            (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a final 
        rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take of 
        reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon 
        prior to the reintroduction.
            (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph 
        (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose more 
        than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional storage 
        releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties due to such 
        reintroduction.
            (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--
                    (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory 
                protections provided in the Endangered Species Act of 
                1973 for any species listed pursuant to section 4 of the 
                Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) other 
                than the reintroduced population of California Central 
                Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon, including protections 
                pursuant to existing biological opinions or new 
                biological opinions issued by the Secretary or Secretary 
                of Commerce; or
                    (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce 
                from imposing protections under the Endangered Species 
                Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species 
                listed pursuant to section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 
                1533) because those protections provide incidental 
                benefits to such reintroduced California Central Valley 
                Spring Run Chinook salmon.

    (d) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the 
        Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the progress 
        made on the reintroduction set forth in this section and the 
        Secretary's plans for future implementation of this section.
            (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall 
        include--
                    (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, 
                to successful reintroduction;
                    (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the 
                reintroduction on the existing population of California 
                Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the 
                Sacramento River or its tributaries; and
                    (C) an assessment regarding the future of the 
                reintroduction.

    (e) FERC Projects.--
            (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley 
        Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the

[[Page 123 STAT. 1364]]

        Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its 
        authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 
        811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in proceedings 
        for projects licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
        Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, and 
        San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with subsection (c) 
        until after the expiration of the term of the Settlement, 
        December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the designation made 
        pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends first.
            (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing prescriptions 
        pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 811) 
        solely for other anadromous fish species because those 
        prescriptions provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced 
        California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.

    (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended or shall 
be construed--
            (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.); 
        or
            (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other 
        application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.).

        Fresno, Madera, Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin counties in 
        California.

    (b) Use of Plan.--The Integrated Regional Water Management Plan 
developed for the 2 hydrologic basins under subsection (a) shall serve 
as a guide for the counties in the study area described in subsection 
(a)(2) to use as a mechanism to address and solve long-term water needs 
in a sustainable and equitable manner.
    (c) Report.--The Secretary shall ensure that a report containing the 
results of the Integrated Regional Water Management Plan for the 
hydrologic regions is submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural

        the

[[Page 123 STAT. 1366]]

        expected water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term 
        contractors caused by the Interim or Restoration Flows

                benefit, in terms of reduction, avoidance, or offset of 
                the water supply impacts expected to be caused by the 
                Interim or Restoration Flows authorized in part I of 
                this subtitle, that will result from the project, and 
                for ensuring appropriate adjustment in the recovered

                construction costs on an annual basis.

    (c) <<NOTE: Deadline. Public comment.>>  Guidelines.--Within 1 year 
from the date of enactment of this part, the Secretary shall develop, in 
consultation with the Friant Division long-term contractors, proposed 
guidelines for the application of the criteria defined in subsection

area and the equitable allocation of funds. Upon adoption of such 
guidelines, the Secretary shall implement such assistance program, 
subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such purpose.

    (d) Cost Sharing.--The Federal financial assistance provided to 
local agencies under subsection (a) shall not exceed--

[[Page 123 STAT. 1367]]

            (3) Upper basin protections.--
                    (A) Consultations.--Henceforth, in any consultation 
                pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1536(a) with respect to water 
                development in the San Juan River Basin, the Secretary 
                shall confer with the States of Colorado and New Mexico, 
                consistent with the provisions of section 5 of the 
                ``Principles for Conducting Endangered Species Act 
                Section 7 Consultations on Water Development and Water 
                Management Activities Affecting Endangered Fish Species 
                in the San Juan River Basin'' as adopted by the 
                Coordination Committee, San Juan River Basin Recovery 
                Implementation Program, on June 19, 2001, and as may be 
                amended or modified.
                    (B) Preservation of existing rights.--Rights to the 
                consumptive use of water available to the Upper Basin 
                from the Colorado River System under the Colorado River 
                Compact and the Compact shall not be reduced or 
                prejudiced by any use of water pursuant to subsection 
                10603(c). Nothing in this Act shall be construed so as 
                to impair, conflict with, or otherwise change the duties 
                and powers of the Upper Colorado River Commission.

    (d) Forbearance.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), during 
        any year in which a shortage to the normal diversion requirement 
        for any use relating to the Project within the State of Arizona 
        occurs (as determined under section 11 of Public Law 87-483 (76 
        Stat. 99)), the Nation may temporarily forbear the delivery of 
        the water supply of the Navajo Reservoir for uses in the State 
        of New Mexico under the apportionments of water to the Navajo 
        Indian Irrigation Project and the normal diversion requirements 
        of the Project to allow an equivalent quantity of water to be 
        delivered from the Navajo Reservoir water supply for municipal 
        and domestic uses of the Nation in the State of Arizona under 
        the Project.
            (2) Limitation of forbearance.--The Nation may forebear the 
        delivery of water under paragraph (1) of a quantity not 
        exceeding the quantity of the shortage to the normal diversion 
        requirement for any use relating to the Project within the State 
        of Arizona.
            (3) Effect.--The forbearance of the delivery of water under 
        paragraph (1) shall be subject to the requirements in subsection 
        (c).

    (e) Effect.--Nothing in this subtitle--
            (1) authorizes the marketing, leasing, or transfer of the 
        water supplies made available to the Nation under the Contract 
        to non-Navajo water users in States other than the State of New 
        Mexico; or
            (2) authorizes the forbearance of water uses in the State of 
        New Mexico to allow uses of water in other States other than as 
        authorized under subsection (d).

    (f) Colorado River Compacts.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law--

[[Page 123 STAT. 1387]]

            (1) water may be diverted by the Project from the San Juan 
        River in the State of New Mexico for use within New Mexico in 
        the lower basin, as that term is used in the Colorado River 
        Compact;
            (2) any water diverted under paragraph (1) shall be a part 
        of, and charged against, the consumptive use apportionment made 
        to the State of New Mexico by Article III(a) of the Compact and 
        to the upper basin by Article III(a) of the Colorado River 
        Compact; and
            (3) any water so diverted by the Project into the lower 
        basin within the State of New Mexico shall not be credited as 
        water reaching Lee Ferry pursuant to Articles III(c) and III(d) 
        of the Colorado River Compact.

    (g) Payment of Operation, Maintenance, and Replacement Costs.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to pay the 
        operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the Project 
        allocable to the Project Participants under section 10604 until 
        the date on which the Secretary declares any section of the 
        Project to be substantially complete and delivery of water 
        generated by, and through, that section of the Project can be 
        made to a Project participant.
            (2) <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  Project participant 
        payments.--Beginning on the date described in paragraph (1), 
        each Project Participant shall pay all allocated operation, 
        maintenance, and replacement costs for that substantially 
        completed section of the Project, in accordance with contracts 
        entered into pursuant to section 10604, except as provided in 
        section 10604(f).

    (h) No Precedent.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as 
authorizing or establishing a precedent for any type of transfer of 
Colorado River System water between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin. Nor 
shall anything in this Act be construed as expanding the Secretary's 
authority in the Upper Basin.
    (i) Unique Situation.--Diversions by the Project consistent with 
this section address critical tribal and non-Indian water supply needs 
under unique circumstances, which include, among other things--
            (1) the intent to benefit an American Indian tribe;
            (2) the Navajo Nation's location in both the Upper and Lower 
        Basin;
            (3) the intent to address critical Indian water needs in the 
        State of Arizona and Indian and non-Indian water needs in the 
        State of New Mexico,
            (4) the location of the Navajo Nation's capital city of 
        Window Rock in the State of Arizona in close proximity to the 
        border of the State of New Mexico and the pipeline route for the 
        Project;
            (5) the lack of other reasonable options available for 
        developing a firm, sustainable supply of municipal water for the 
        Navajo Nation at Window Rock in the State of Arizona; and
            (6) the limited volume of water to be diverted by the 
        Project to supply municipal uses in the Window Rock area in the 
        State of Arizona.

    (j) Consensus.--Congress notes the consensus of the Governors' 
Representatives on Colorado River Operations of the States that are 
signatory to the Colorado River Compact regarding the diversions 
authorized for the Project under this section.

[[Page 123 STAT. 1388]]

    (k) Efficient Use.--The diversions and uses authorized for the 
Project under this Section represent unique and efficient uses of 
Colorado River apportionments in a manner that Congress has determined 
would be consistent with the obligations of the United States to the 
Navajo Nation.

Subtitle <<NOTE: Nevada.>>  C--Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley 
Reservation Water Rights Settlement
SEC. 10801. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) it is the policy of the United States, in accordance 
        with the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian 
        tribes, to promote Indian self-determination and economic self-
        sufficiency and to settle Indian water rights claims without 
        lengthy and costly litigation, if practicable;

[[Page 123 STAT. 1406]]

            (2) quantifying rights to water and development of 
        facilities needed to use tribal water supplies is essential to 
        the development of viable Indian reservation economies and the 
        establishment of a permanent reservation homeland;
            (3) uncertainty concerning the extent of the Shoshone-Paiute 
        Tribes' water rights has resulted in limited access to water and 
        inadequate financial resources necessary to achieve self-
        determination and self-sufficiency;
            (4) in 2006, the Tribes, the State of Idaho, the affected 
        individual water users, and the United States resolved all 
        tribal claims to water rights in the Snake River Basin 
        Adjudication through a consent decree entered by the District 
        Court of the Fifth Judicial District of the State of Idaho, 
        requiring no further Federal action to quantify the Tribes' 
        water rights in the State of Idaho;
            (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, proceedings to 
        determine the extent and nature of the water rights of the 
        Tribes in the East Fork of the Owyhee River in Nevada are 
        pending before the Nevada State Engineer;
            (6) final resolution of the Tribes' water claims in the East 
        Fork of the Owyhee River adjudication will--
                    (A) take many years;
                    (B) entail great expense;
                    (C) continue to limit the access of the Tribes to 
                water, with economic and social consequences;
                    (D) prolong uncertainty relating to the availability 
                of water supplies; and
                    (E) seriously impair long-term economic planning and 
                development for all parties to the litigation;
            (7) after many years of negotiation, the Tribes, the State, 
        and the upstream water users have entered into a settlement 
        agreement to resolve permanently all water rights of the Tribes 
        in the State; and
            (8) the Tribes also seek to resolve certain water-related 
        claims for damages against the United States.
SEC. 10802. PURPOSES.

            (1) to resolve outstanding issues with respect to the East

Atmospheric Administration through the Office of Ocean and Coastal 
Resource Management.

    ``(b) Property Acquisition Grants.--The Secretary shall make grants 
under the program to coastal states with approved coastal zone 
management plans or National Estuarine Research Reserve units for the 
purpose of acquiring property or interests in property described in 
subsection (a) that will further the goals of--

        coastal zone management program, any National Estuarine Research 
        Reserve in that State, and the lead agency designated by the 
        Governor for coordinating the implementation of this section (if 
        different from the coastal zone management program).
            ``(2) Each participating coastal state, after consultation 
        with local governmental entities and other interested 
        stakeholders,

[[Page 123 STAT. 1443]]

        shall identify priority conservation needs within the State, the 
        values to be protected by inclusion of lands in the program, and 
        the threats to those values that should be avoided.
            ``(3) Each participating coastal state shall to the extent 
        practicable ensure that the acquisition of property or easements 
        shall complement working waterfront needs.
            ``(4) The applicant shall identify the values to be 
        protected by inclusion of the lands in the program, management 
        activities that are planned and the manner in which they may

        protection and ability to successfully leverage funds among 
        participating entities, including Federal programs, regional 
        organizations, State and other governmental units, landowners, 
        corporations, or private organizations.
            ``(6) The governor, or the lead agency designated by the 
        governor for coordinating the implementation of this section, 
        where appropriate in consultation with the appropriate local 
        government, shall determine that the application is consistent 
        with the State's or territory's approved coastal zone plan, 
        program, and policies prior to submittal to the Secretary.
            ``(7)(A) Priority shall be given to lands described in 
        subsection (a) that can be effectively managed and protected and 
        that have significant ecological value.
            ``(B) Of the projects that meet the standard in subparagraph 
        (A), priority shall be given to lands that--
                    ``(i) are under an imminent threat of conversion to 
                a use that will degrade or otherwise diminish their 
                natural, undeveloped, or recreational state; and
                    ``(ii) serve to mitigate the adverse impacts caused 
                by coastal population growth in the coastal environment.
            ``(8) In developing guidelines under this section, the 
        Secretary shall consult with coastal states, other Federal 
        agencies, and other interested stakeholders with expertise in 
        land acquisition and conservation procedures.
            ``(9) Eligible coastal states or National Estuarine Research 
        Reserves may allocate grants to local governments or agencies 
        eligible for assistance under section 306A(e).
            ``(10) <<NOTE: Performance 
        measures. Evaluations. Deadline.>>  The Secretary shall develop 
        performance measures that the Secretary shall use to evaluate

    ``(d) Limitations and Private Property Protections.--
            ``(1) A grant awarded under this section may be used to 
        purchase land or an interest in land, including an easement, 
        only from a willing seller. Any such purchase shall not be the 
        result of a forced taking under this section. Nothing in this 
        section requires a private property owner to participate in the 
        program under this section.
            ``(2) Any interest in land, including any easement, acquired 
        with a grant under this section shall not be considered to 
        create any new liability, or have any effect on liability under 
        any other law, of any private property owner with respect to any 
        person injured on the private property.
            ``(3) Nothing in this section requires a private property 
        owner to provide access (including Federal, State, or local

[[Page 123 STAT. 1444]]

        government access) to or use of private property unless such 
        property or an interest in such property (including a 
        conservation easement) has been purchased with funds made 
        available under this section.

    ``(e) Recognition of Authority to Control Land Use.--Nothing in this 
title modifies the authority of Federal, State, or local governments to 
regulate land use.
    ``(f) Matching Requirements.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may not make a grant under 
        the program unless the Federal funds are matched by non-Federal 
        funds in accordance with this subsection.
            ``(2) Cost share requirement.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Grant funds under the program 
                shall require a 100 percent match from other non-Federal 
                sources.
                    ``(B) Waiver of requirement.--The Secretary may 
                grant a waiver of subparagraph (A) for underserved 
                communities, communities that have an inability to draw 
                on other sources of funding because of the small 
                population or low income of the community, or for other 
                reasons the Secretary deems appropriate and consistent 
                with the purposes of the program.
            ``(3) Other federal funds.--Where financial assistance 
        awarded under this section represents only a portion of the 
        total cost of a project, funding from other Federal sources may 
        be applied to the cost of the project. Each portion shall be 
        subject to match requirements under the applicable provision of 
        law.
            ``(4) Source of matching cost share.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (2)(A), the non-Federal cost share for a project may 
        be determined by taking into account the following:
                    ``(A) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  The value of land or 
                a conservation easement may be used by a project 
                applicant as non-Federal match, if the Secretary

                      the date of the submission of the grant 
                      application and ending 3 years after the date of 
                      the award of the grant;

                      held by a non-governmental organization included 
                      in the grant application in perpetuity for 
                      conservation purposes of the program; and

                management planning, remediation, restoration, and 
                enhancement may be used as non- Federal match if the 
                activities are identified in the plan and expenses are 
                incurred within the period of the grant award, or, for 
                lands described in (A), within the same time limits
