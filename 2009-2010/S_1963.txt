        the scope of services available under, hospital care and medical 
        services.
            (6) The perception of personal safety and comfort in 
        inpatient, outpatient, and behavioral health facilities.
            (7) The gender sensitivity of health care providers and 
        staff to issues that particularly affect women.
            (8) The effectiveness of outreach for health care services 
        available to women veterans.
            (9) The location and operating hours of health care 
        facilities that provide services to women veterans.
