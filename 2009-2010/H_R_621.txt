            (2) In 1911, Juliette Gordon Low met Sir Robert Baden-

        first 2 Girl Scout Troops in Savannah, Georgia consisting of 18 
        members.
            (5) Low devoted the next 15 years of her life to building 
        the organization, which would become the largest voluntary 
        association for women and girls in the United States.
            (6) Low drafted the Girl Scout laws, supervised the writing 
        of the first handbook in 1913, and provided most of the 
        financial support for the organization during its early years.
            (7) The Girl Scouts of the United States of America was 
        chartered by the United States Congress in 1950 in title 36, 
        United States Code.
            (8) Today there are more than 3,700,000 members in 236,000 
        troops throughout the United States and United States

            (10) More than 50,000,000 American women enjoyed Girl 
        Scouting during their childhood--and that number continues to 
        grow as Girl Scouts of the United States of America continues to 
        inspire, challenge, and empower girls everywhere.
