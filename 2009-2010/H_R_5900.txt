[[Page 124 STAT. 2359]]

                    (A) Establish flight crewmember mentoring programs 
                under which the air carrier will pair highly experienced 
                flight crewmembers who will serve as mentor pilots and 
                be paired with newly employed flight crewmembers. Mentor 
                pilots should be provided, at a minimum, specific 
                instruction on techniques for instilling and reinforcing 
                the highest standards of technical performance, 
                airmanship, and professionalism in newly employed flight 
                crewmembers.
                    (B) Establish flight crewmember professional 
                development committees made up of air carrier management

                representatives to develop, administer, and oversee 
                formal mentoring programs of the carrier to assist 
                flight crewmembers to reach their maximum potential as 
                safe, seasoned, and proficient flight crewmembers.
                    (C) Establish or modify training programs to 
                accommodate substantially different levels and types of 
                flight experience by newly employed flight crewmembers.
                    (D) Establish or modify training programs for

                qualify as pilot-in-command flight crewmembers for the 
                first time in a specific aircraft type and ensure that 
                such programs include leadership and command training.
                    (E) Ensure that recurrent training for pilots in 
                command includes leadership and command training.

                streamlined review process for part 121 air carriers 
                that have in effect, as of the date of enactment of this 
                Act, the programs described in paragraph (1).

        safety action and flight operational quality assurance programs 
        can quickly begin to report data into the aviation safety 
        information analysis sharing database; and
            (3) how part 121 air carriers and aviation safety inspectors

specific academic training courses, beyond those required under 
subsection (b)(2), to be credited toward the total flight hours required 
under subsection (c). The Administrator may allow such credit based on a

specific academic training courses will enhance safety more than 
requiring the pilot to fully comply with the flight hours requirement.
    (e) Recommendations of Expert Panel.--In conducting the rulemaking 
proceeding under this section, the Administrator shall review and 
consider the assessment and recommendations of the expert panel to 
review part 121 and part 135 training hours established by section
