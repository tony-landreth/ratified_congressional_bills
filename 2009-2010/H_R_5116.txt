SEC. 517. <<NOTE: 42 USC 1862p-9.>>  EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE 
            COMPETITIVE RESEARCH.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 stated, ``it 
        shall be an objective of the Foundation to strengthen research 
        and education in the sciences and engineering, including 
        independent research by individuals, throughout the United 
        States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and 
        education,'';
            (2) National Science Foundation funding remains highly 
        concentrated, with 27 States and 2 jurisdictions, taken 
        together, receiving only about 10 percent of all NSF research 
        funding; each of these States received only a fraction of one 
        percent of Foundation's research dollars each year;
            (3) the Nation requires the talent, expertise, and research 
        capabilities of all States in order to prepare sufficient 
        numbers of scientists and engineers, remain globally competitive 
        and support economic development.

    (b) Continuation of Program.--The Director shall continue to carry 
out EPSCoR, with the objective of helping the eligible States to develop 
the research infrastructure that will make them more competitive for 
Foundation and other Federal research funding. The program shall 
continue to increase as the National Science Foundation funding 
increases.
    (c) Congressional Reports.--The Director shall report to the 
appropriate committees of Congress on an annual basis, using the most 
recent available data--
            (1) the total amount made available, by State, under EPSCoR;
            (2) the amount of co-funding made available to EPSCoR 
        States;
            (3) the total amount of National Science Foundation funding 
        made available to all institutions and entities within EPSCoR 
        States; and
            (4) efforts and accomplishments to more fully integrate the 
        29 EPSCoR jurisdictions in major activities and initiatives of 
        the Foundation.

    (d) Coordination of EPSCoR and Similar Federal Programs.--
            (1) Another finding.--The Congress finds that a number of 
        Federal agencies have programs, such as Experimental Programs to 
        Stimulate Competitive Research and the National Institutes of 
        Health Institutional Development Award program, designed to 
        increase the capacity for and quality of science and technology 
        research and training at academic institutions in States that 
        historically have received relatively little Federal research 
        and development funding.
            (2) Coordination required.--The EPSCoR Interagency 
        Coordinating Committee, chaired by the National Science 
        Foundation, shall--
                    (A) coordinate EPSCoR and Federal EPSCoR-like 
                programs to maximize the impact of Federal support for

[[Page 124 STAT. 4014]]

                building competitive research infrastructure, and in 
                order to achieve an integrated Federal effort;
                    (B) coordinate agency objectives with State and 
                institutional goals, to obtain continued non-Federal 
                support of science and technology research and training;
                    (C) develop metrics to assess gains in academic 
                research quality and competitiveness, and in science and 
                technology human resource development;
                    (D) conduct a cross-agency evaluation of EPSCoR and 
                other Federal EPSCoR-like programs and accomplishments, 
                including management, investment, and metric-measuring 
                strategies implemented by the different agencies aimed 
                to increase the number of new investigators receiving 
                peer-reviewed funding, broaden participation, and 
                empower knowledge generation, dissemination, 
                application, and national research and development 
                competitiveness;
                    (E) coordinate the development and implementation of 
                new, novel workshops, outreach activities, and follow-up 
                mentoring activities among EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like 
                programs for colleges and universities in EPSCoR States 
                and territories in order to increase the number of 
                proposals submitted and successfully funded and to 
                enhance statewide coordination of EPSCoR and Federal 
                EPSCoR-like programs;
                    (F) coordinate the development of new, innovative 
                solicitations and programs to facilitate collaborations, 
                partnerships, and mentoring activities among faculty at 
                all levels in non-EPSCoR and EPSCoR States and 
                jurisdictions;
                    (G) conduct an evaluation of the roles, 
                responsibilities and degree of autonomy that program 
                officers or managers (or the equivalent position) have 
                in executing EPSCoR programs at the different Federal 
                agencies and the impacts these differences have on the 
                number of EPSCoR State and jurisdiction faculty 
                participating in the peer review process and the 
                percentage of successful awards by individual EPSCoR 
                State jurisdiction and individual researcher; and
                    (H) <<NOTE: Survey.>>  conduct a survey of colleges 
                and university faculty at all levels regarding their 
                knowledge and understanding of EPSCoR, and their level 
                of interaction with and knowledge about their respective 
                State or Jurisdictional EPSCoR Committee.
            (3) Meetings and reports.--The Committee shall meet at least 
        twice each fiscal year and shall submit an annual report to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress describing progress made in 
        carrying out paragraph (2).

    (e) Federal Agency Reports.--Each Federal agency that administers an 
EPSCoR or Federal EPSCoR-like program shall submit to the OSTP as part 
of its Federal budget submission--
            (1) a description of the program strategy and objectives;

SEC. 518. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, 
            ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS TALENT EXPANSION PROGRAM.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
        Talent Expansion Program established by the National Science 
        Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 continues to be an 
        effective program to increase the number of students, who are 
        citizens or permanent residents of the United States, receiving 
        associate or baccalaureate degrees in established or emerging 
        fields within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, 
        and its authorization continues;
            (2) the strategies employed continue to strengthen mentoring 
        and tutoring between faculty and students and provide students 
        with information and exposure to potential career pathways in 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas;
            (3) this highly competitive program awarded 145 Program 
        implementation awards and 12 research projects in the first 6 
        years of operations; and
            (4) the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
        Talent Expansion Program should continue to be supported by the 
        National Science Foundation.

SEC. 519. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE NATIONAL SCIENCE 
            FOUNDATION'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO BASIC RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the National Science Foundation is an independent 
        Federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to, among other

[[Page 124 STAT. 4016]]

        things, promote the progress of science, to advance the national 
        health, prosperity, and welfare, and to secure the national 
        defense;
            (2) the Foundation is the funding source for approximately 
        20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted 
        by America's colleges and universities, and is the major source 
        of Federal backing for mathematics, computer science and other 
        sciences;
            (3) the America COMPETES Act of 2007 helped rejuvenate our 
        focus on increasing basic research investment in the physical 
        sciences, strengthening educational opportunities in the 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields and 
        developing a robust innovation infrastructure; and
            (4) reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act should 
        continue a robust investment in basic research and education and 
        preserve the essence of the original Act by increasing the 
        investment focus on science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics basic research and education as a national priority.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the National Science Foundation is the finest scientific 
        foundation in the world, and is a vital agency that must support 
        basic research needed to advance the United States into the 21st 
        century;
            (2) the National Science Foundation should focus Federal 
        research and development resources primarily in the areas of 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics basic research 
        and education; and
            (3) the National Science Foundation should strive to ensure 
        that federally-supported research is of the finest quality, is 
        ground breaking, and answers questions or solves problems that 
        are of utmost importance to society at large.

  TITLE VII--NIST GREEN <<NOTE: NIST Grants for Energy Efficiency, New 
   Job Opportunities, and Business Solutions Act of 2010. 15 USC 271 
note.>>  JOBS

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``NIST Grants for Energy Efficiency, 
New Job Opportunities, and Business Solutions Act of 2010'' or the 
``NIST GREEN JOBS Act of 2010''.

SEC. 702. <<NOTE: 15 USC 278k note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over its 20-year existence, the Hollings Manufacturing 
        Extension Partnership has proven its value to manufacturers as 
        demonstrated by the resulting impact on jobs and the economies 
        of all 50 States and the Nation as a whole.
            (2) The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership has 
        helped thousands of companies reinvest in themselves through 
        process improvement and business growth initiatives leading to 
        more sales, new markets, and the adoption of technology to 
        deliver new products and services.
            (3) Manufacturing is an increasingly important part of the 
        construction sector as the industry moves to the use of more 
        components and factory built sub-assemblies.
            (4) Construction practices must become more efficient and 
        precise if the United States is to construct and renovate its 
        building stock to reduce related carbon emissions to levels that 
        are consistent with combating global warming.
            (5) Many companies involved in construction are small, 
        without access to innovative manufacturing techniques, and could 
        benefit from the type of training and business analysis 
        activities that the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
        routinely provides to the Nation's manufacturers and their 
        supply chains.
            (6) Broadening the competitiveness grant program under 
        section 25(f) of the National Institute of Standards and 
        Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278k(f)) could help develop and 
        diffuse knowledge necessary to capture a large portion of the 
        estimated $100 billion or more in energy savings if buildings in 
        the United States met the level and quality of energy efficiency 
        now found in buildings in certain other countries.

[[Page 124 STAT. 4042]]

            (7) It is therefore in the national interest to expand the 
        capabilities of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
        to be supportive of the construction and green energy 
        industries.
