                plan to meet the additional requirements imposed by the 
                amendments made by this section, the State plan shall 
                not be regarded as failing to comply with the 
                requirements of the amendments made by this section 
                solely on the basis of its failure to meet such 
                additional requirements before the first day of the 
                first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the 
                first regular session of the State legislature that 
                begins after the date of the enactment of this Act. For 
                purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a 
                State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year 
                of the session is considered to be a separate regular 
                session of the State legislature.
