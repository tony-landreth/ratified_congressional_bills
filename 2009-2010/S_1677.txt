    (a) Findings.--Section 2 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50

``SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) the security of the United States is dependent on the 
        ability of the domestic industrial base to supply materials and 
        services for the national defense and to prepare for and respond 
        to military conflicts, natural or man-caused disasters, or acts 
        of terrorism within the United States;
            ``(2) to ensure the vitality of the domestic industrial 
        base, actions are needed--
                    ``(A) to promote industrial resources preparedness 
                in the event of domestic or foreign threats to the 
                security of the United States;
                    ``(B) to support continuing improvements in 
                industrial efficiency and responsiveness;
                    ``(C) to provide for the protection and restoration 
                of domestic critical infrastructure operations under 
                emergency conditions; and
                    ``(D) to respond to actions taken outside of the 
                United States that could result in reduced supplies of 
                strategic and critical materials, including energy, 
                necessary for national defense and the general economic 
                well-being of the United States;
            ``(3) in order to provide for the national security, the 
        national defense preparedness effort of the United States 
        Government requires--
                    ``(A) preparedness programs to respond to both 
                domestic emergencies and international threats to 
                national defense;
                    ``(B) measures to improve the domestic industrial 
                base for national defense;
                    ``(C) the development of domestic productive 
                capacity to meet--
                          ``(i) essential national defense needs that 
                      can result from emergency conditions; and
                          ``(ii) unique technological requirements; and
                    ``(D) the diversion of certain materials and 
                facilities from ordinary use to national defense 
                purposes, when national defense needs cannot otherwise 
                be satisfied in a timely fashion;
            ``(4) to meet the requirements referred to in this 
        subsection, this Act provides the President with an array of 
        authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and 
        to take

[[Page 123 STAT. 2008]]

        appropriate steps to maintain and enhance the domestic 
        industrial base;
            ``(5) in order to ensure national defense preparedness, it 
        is necessary and appropriate to assure the availability of 
        domestic energy supplies for national defense needs;
            ``(6) to further assure the adequate maintenance of the 
        domestic industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, 
        domestic energy supplies should be augmented through reliance on 
        renewable energy sources (including solar, geothermal, wind, and 
        biomass sources), more efficient energy storage and distribution 
        technologies, and energy conservation measures;
            ``(7) much of the industrial capacity that is relied upon by 
        the United States Government for military production and other 
        national defense purposes is deeply and directly influenced by--
                    ``(A) the overall competitiveness of the industrial 
                economy of the United States; and
                    ``(B) the ability of industries in the United 
                States, in general, to produce internationally 
                competitive products and operate profitably while 
                maintaining adequate research and development to 
                preserve competitiveness with respect to military and 
                civilian production; and
            ``(8) the inability of industries in the United States, 
        especially smaller subcontractors and suppliers, to provide 
        vital parts and components and other materials would impair the 
        ability to sustain the Armed Forces of the United States in 
        combat for longer than a short period.

    ``(b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that--
            ``(1) to ensure the adequacy of productive capacity and 
        supply, Federal departments and agencies that are responsible 
        for national defense acquisition should continuously assess the 
        capability of the domestic industrial base to satisfy production 
        requirements under both peacetime and emergency conditions, 
        specifically evaluating the availability of adequate production 
        sources, including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, 
        skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel;
            ``(2) every effort should be made to foster cooperation 
        between the defense and commercial sectors for research and 
        development and for acquisition of materials, components, and 
        equipment;
            ``(3) plans and programs to carry out the purposes of this 
        Act should be undertaken with due consideration for promoting 
        efficiency and competition;
            ``(4) in providing United States Government financial 
        assistance under this Act to correct a domestic industrial base 
        shortfall, the President should give consideration to the 
        creation or maintenance of production sources that will remain 
        economically viable after such assistance has ended;
            ``(5) authorities under this Act should be used to reduce 
        the vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks, and 
        to minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from terrorist 
        attacks that occur in the United States;
            ``(6) in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of 
        an attack on the United States, the United States Government 
        should encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial 
        facilities in the United States to discourage the concentration

[[Page 123 STAT. 2009]]

        of such productive facilities within limited geographic areas 
        that are vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States;
            ``(7) to ensure that essential national defense requirements 
        are met, consideration should be given to stockpiling strategic 
        materials, to the extent that such stockpiling is economical and 
        feasible; and
            ``(8) in the construction of any industrial facility owned 
        by the United States Government, in the rendition of any 
        financial assistance by the United States Government for the 
        construction, expansion, or improvement of any industrial 
        facility, and in the production of goods and services, under 
        this Act or any other provision of law, each department and 
        agency of the United States Government should apply, under the 
        coordination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when 
        practicable and consistent with existing law and the 
        desirability for maintaining a sound economy, the principle of 
        geographic dispersal of such facilities in the interest of 
        national defense.''.
SEC. 4. PRIORITY IN CONTRACTS AND ORDERS.

    Section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 
2071) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) The head of each Federal agency to which the President 
delegates authority under this section shall--
            ``(1) <<NOTE: Deadline. Regulations.>>  not later than 270 
        days after the date of enactment of the Defense Production Act 
        Reauthorization of 2009, issue final rules, in accordance with 
        section 553 of title 5, United States Code, that establish 
        standards and procedures by which the priorities and allocations 
        authority under this section is used to promote the national 
        defense, under both emergency and nonemergency conditions; and
            ``(2) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  as appropriate and to the 
        extent practicable, consult with the heads of other Federal 
        agencies to develop a consistent and unified Federal priorities 
        and allocations system.''.
SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF ENERGY AS A STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL 
                    MATERIAL.
