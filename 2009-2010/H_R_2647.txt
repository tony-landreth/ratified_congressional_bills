SEC. 255. NEXT GENERATION BOMBER AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Long-range strike is a critical mission in which the 
        United States needs to retain a credible and dominant 
        capability.
            (2) Long range, penetrating strike systems provide--
                    (A) a hedge against being unable to obtain access to 
                forward bases for political reasons;
                    (B) a capacity to respond quickly to contingencies;
                    (C) the ability to base outside the reach of 
                emerging adversary anti-access and area-denial 
                capabilities; and
                    (D) the ability to impose disproportionate defensive 
                costs on prospective adversaries of the United States.
            (3) The 2006 quadrennial defense review found that there was 
        a requirement for a next generation bomber aircraft and directed 
        the United States Air Force to ``develop a new land-based, 
        penetrating long range strike capability to be fielded by 
        2018''.
            (4) On April 6, 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
        announced that the United States ``will not pursue a development 
        program for a follow-on Air Force bomber until we have a better 
        understanding of the need, the requirement and the technology''.
            (5) On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced the 
        termination of the next generation bomber aircraft program in 
        the document of the Office of Management and Budget entitled 
        ``Terminations, Reductions, and Savings'', stating that ``there 
        is no urgent need to begin an expensive development program for 
        a new bomber'' and that ``the future bomber fleet may not be 
        affordable over the next six years''.
            (6) The United States will need a new long-range strike 
        capability because the conflicts of the future will likely 
        feature heavily defended airspace, due in large part to the 
        proliferation of relatively inexpensive, but sophisticated and 
        deadly, air defense systems.
            (7) General Michael Maples, the Director of the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency, noted during a March 10, 2009, hearing of 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on worldwide 
        threats that ``Russia, quite frankly, is the developer of most 
        of those [advanced air defense] systems and is exporting those 
        systems both to China and to other countries in the world''.
            (8) The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the 
        Strategic Posture of the United States, submitted to Congress on 
        May 6, 2009, states that ``[t]he bomber force is valuable

[[Page 123 STAT. 2245]]

        particularly for extending deterrence in time of crisis, as 
        their deployment is visible and signals U.S. commitment. Bombers 
        also impose a significant cost burden on potential adversaries 
        in terms of the need to invest in advanced air defenses''.
            (9) The commanders of the United States Pacific Command, the 
        United States Strategic Command, and the United States Joint 
        Forces Command have each testified before the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the Senate in support of the capability that the 
        next generation bomber aircraft would provide.
            (10) On June 17, 2009, General James Cartwright, Vice-
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and chair of the Joint 
        Requirements Oversight Council, stated during a hearing before 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``the nation 
        needs a new bomber''.
            (11) Nearly half of the United States bomber aircraft 
        inventory (47 percent) pre-dates the Cuban Missile Crisis.
            (12) The only air-breathing strike platforms the United 
        States possesses today with reach and survivability to have a 
        chance of successfully executing missions more than 1,000 
        nautical miles into enemy territory from the last air-to-air 
        refueling are 16 combat ready B-2 bomber aircraft.
            (13) The B-2 bomber aircraft was designed in the 1980s and 
        achieved initial operational capability over a decade ago.
            (14) The crash of an operational B-2 bomber aircraft during 
        takeoff at Guam in early 2008 indicates that attrition can and 
        does occur even in peacetime.
            (15) The primary mission requirement of the next generation 
        bomber aircraft is the ability to strike targets anywhere on the 
        globe with whatever weapons the contingency requires.
            (16) The requisite aerodynamic, structural, and low-
        observable technologies to develop the next generation bomber 
        aircraft already exist in fifth-generation fighter aircraft.

    (b) Policy on Continued Development of Next Generation Bomber 
Aircraft in Fiscal Year 2010.--It is the policy of the United States to 
support a development program for next generation bomber aircraft 
technologies.

        consultation with the Secretary of Education, conduct a study on 
        options for educational opportunities that are, or may be, 
        available for dependent children of members of the Armed Forces 
        who do not attend Department of Defense dependents' schools when

                families in securing quality elementary and secondary 
                education for their children when the public elementary 
                and secondary schools attended by their children are 
                identified as being in need of improvement.
                    (B) The extent to which perceptions of differing 
                degrees of quality in public elementary and secondary 
                schools in different regions of the United States affect 
                plans of military families to relocate, including

                station.

                educational opportunities for their children other than 
                those available through local public elementary and 
                secondary schools.
                    (D) The current level of student achievement in 
                public elementary and secondary schools in school 
                districts which have a high percentage of students who 
                are children of military families.
                    (E) The educational needs of children of military 
                families who are required by location to attend public 
                elementary and secondary schools identified as being in 
                need of improvement.
                    (F) The value and impact of other alternative 
                educational programs for military families.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2294]]

                    (G) The extent to which the options referred to in 
                paragraph (2) would provide a meaningful option for 
                education for military children when the public 
                elementary and secondary schools attended by such 
                children are determined to be in need of improvement.
                    (H) The extent to which the options referred to in

                students with learning disabilities and gifted students.
                    (I) Such other matters as the Secretary of Defense 
                and Secretary of Education consider appropriate for 
                purposes of the study.

SEC. 662. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
                        FORCES.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) all United States commercial air carriers should seek to 
        lend their support with flexible, generous policies applicable 
        to members of the Armed Forces who are traveling on leave or 
        liberty at their own expense; and

[[Page 123 STAT. 2371]]

            (2) each United States air carrier, for all members of the 
        Armed Forces who have been granted leave or liberty and who are 
        traveling by air at their own expense, should--
                    (A) seek to provide reduced air fares that are 
                comparable to the lowest airfare for ticketed flights 
                and that eliminate to the maximum extent possible 
                advance purchase requirements;
                    (B) seek to eliminate change fees or charges and any 
                penalties;
                    (C) seek to eliminate or reduce baggage and excess 
                weight fees;
                    (D) offer flexible terms that allow members to 
                purchase, modify, or cancel tickets without time 
                restrictions, and to waive fees (including baggage 
                fees), ancillary costs, or penalties; and
                    (E) seek to take proactive measures to ensure that 
                all airline employees, particularly those who issue 
                tickets and respond to members of the Armed Forces and 
                their family members, are trained in the policies of the 
                airline aimed at benefitting members of the Armed Forces 
                who are on leave.
SEC. 663. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF FLEXIBLE SPENDING 
                        ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE UNIFORMED SERVICES.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense, with respect to members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and 
Air Force, the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to members 
of the Coast Guard, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with 
respect to commissioned officers of the Public Health Service, and the 
Secretary of Commerce, with respect to commissioned officers of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, should establish 
procedures to implement flexible spending arrangements with respect to 
basic pay and compensation for health care and dependent care on a pre-
tax basis in accordance with regulations prescribed under sections 
106(c) and 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (b) Considerations.--It is the sense of Congress that, in 
establishing the procedures described by subsection (a), the Secretary 
of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, and the Secretary of Commerce should consider life 
events of members of the uniformed services that are unique to them as 
members of the uniformed services, including changes relating to 
permanent changes of duty station and deployments to overseas 
contingency operations.
SEC. 664. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SUPPORT FOR COMPENSATION, 
                        RETIREMENT, AND OTHER MILITARY PERSONNEL 
                        PROGRAMS.

    It is the sense of Congress that members of the Armed Forces and 
their families and survivors and military retirees deserve ongoing 
recognition and support for their service and sacrifices on behalf of 
the United States, and Congress will continue to be vigilant in 
identifying appropriate direct spending offsets that can be used to 
address shortcomings within those military personnel programs that incur 
mandatory spending obligations.

        are able to avoid potential violations of post-employment 
        restrictions and conflicts of interest in interactions with 
        former personnel of the Department;

        flag officers.
SEC. 903. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONAL 
                        ENERGY PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The demand for operational energy within the Department 
        of Defense imposes significant logistical burdens and 
        operational vulnerabilities on the warfighter and increases 
        force protection requirements.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2424]]

            (2) In March 2008, the Comptroller General of the United 
        States found that responsibilities for operational energy 
        strategy, management, and oversight within the Department are 
        diffused throughout various offices and working groups, 
        including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Office of the Under 
        Secretary of Defense for Policy; the Office of the Under 
        Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the Office of Program 
        Analysis and Evaluation; the Office of the Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff; the commanders of the combatant commands; and 
        the offices of the Secretaries of the military departments.
            (3) The Defense Science Board's 2008 report titled ``More 
        Fight - Less Fuel'' stated that ``There are currently few 
        efforts to manage energy demand by operational forces, which 
        consume about three quarters of DoD energy, perhaps because no 
        one is in charge. The lowest organizational level where all 
        decisions that drive DoD energy use come together is the Deputy 
        Secretary of Defense, implying the need for a senior energy 
        official, and oversight of the Department's energy strategy and 
        program by the Deputy's Advisory Working Group (DAWG).''.
            (4) Congress established the Director of Operational Energy 
        Plans and Programs in section 139b of title 10, United States 
        Code, to provide leadership, conduct oversight, and be 
        accountable for operational energy plans and programs in the 
        Department of Defense and the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine 
        Corps.
            (5) Congress envisioned that the Director would have a 
        direct line of communication with the Secretary of Defense and 
        the Deputy Secretary of Defense, including participation in the 
        Deputy's Advisory Working Group.
            (6) The Department of Defense issued a statement that it 
        ``intends to establish this position as administratively 
        reporting to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, 
        Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)), and this official would 
        report directly to the Secretary of Defense on issues related to 
        Operational Energy''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Director of Operational Energy Plans and Programs should report directly 
to the Secretary of Defense on issues related to operational energy and 
be included as a fully participating member of the Advisory Working 
Group of the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
SEC. 904. INCREASED FLEXIBILITY FOR COMBATANT COMMANDER INITIATIVE 
                        FUND.

    (a) Increase in Funding Limitations.--Subparagraph (A) of section 
166a(e)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``$10,000,000'' and inserting 
        ``$20,000,000''; and
            (2) by striking ``$15,000'' and inserting ``the investment 
        unit cost threshold in effect under section 2245a of this 
        title''.

    (b) Coordination With Relevant Chief of Mission.--Paragraph (6) of 
section 166a(b) of such title is amended by inserting after 
``assistance,'' the following: ``in coordination with the relevant chief 
of mission to the extent practicable,''.

Representatives.

action'' means--
            (1) the transfer of the Defense Technology Security 
        Administration to an Under Secretary or other office of the 
        Department of Defense other than the Under Secretary of Defense 
        for Policy;
            (2) the consolidation of the Defense Technology Security 
        Administration with another office, agency, or field activity of

                 Subtitle C--Naval Vessels and Shipyards

SEC. 1021. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE MAINTENANCE OF A 313-SHIP 
                          NAVY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of the Navy has a stated requirement for 
        a 313-ship fleet.
            (2) The Navy can better meet this requirement--
                    (A) by procuring sufficient numbers of new ships; 
                and
                    (B) by ensuring the sound material condition of 
                existing ships that will enable the Navy to utilize them 
                for their full planned service lives.
            (3) When procuring new classes of ships, the Navy must 
        exercise greater caution than it has exhibited to date in 
        proceeding from one stage of the acquisition cycle to the next 
        before a ship program has achieved a level of maturity that 
        significantly lowers the risk of cost growth and schedule 
        slippage.
            (4) In retaining existing assets, the Navy can do a much 
        better job of achieving the full planned service lives of ships 
        and extending the service lives of certain ships so as to keep 
        their unique capabilities in the fleet while the Navy takes the 
        time necessary to develop and field next-generation capabilities 
        under a low risk program.
            (5) The Navy can undertake certain development approaches 
        that can help the Navy control the total costs of ownership of a 
        ship or class of ships, including emphasizing common hull 
        designs, open architecture combat systems, and other common ship 
        systems in order to achieve efficiency in acquiring and 
        supporting various classes of ships.
            (6) The Navy needs to continue its efforts toward achieving 
        an open architecture for existing combat systems, as this will 
        have great benefit in reducing the costs and risks of fielding 
        new classes of ships, and will yield recurring savings from 
        reducing the costs of buying later ships in a program and 
        reducing life cycle support costs for ships and classes of 
        ships.
            (7) The Navy can also undertake other measures to acquire 
        new ships and maintain the current fleet with greater 
        efficiency, including--
                    (A) greater use of fixed-price contracts;
                    (B) maximizing competition (or the option of 
                competition) throughout the life cycle of its ships;
                    (C) entering into multi-year contracts when 
                warranted; and
                    (D) employing an incremental approach to developing 
                new technologies.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Navy should meet its requirement for a 313-ship 
        fleet until such time that modifications to the Navy's ship 
        fleet force structure are warranted, and the Secretary of the 
        Navy provides Congress with a justification of any proposed 
        modifications, supported by rigorous and sufficient warfighting 
        analysis;
            (2) the Navy should take greater care to achieve the full 
        planned service life of existing ships and reduce the incidence 
        of early ship decommissioning;

[[Page 123 STAT. 2445]]

            (3) the Navy should exercise greater restraint on the 
        acquisition process for ships in order to achieve on-time, on-
        cost shipbuilding programs; and
            (4) Congress should support the Navy when it is acting 
        responsibly to undertake measures that can help the Navy achieve 
        the requirement for a 313-ship fleet and maintain a fleet that 
        is adequate to meet the national security needs of the United 
        States.
SEC. 1022. DESIGNATION OF U.S.S. CONSTITUTION AS AMERICA'S SHIP OF 
                          STATE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the Act entitled ``An Act to Provide a Naval 
        Armament'', approved on March 27, 1794 (1 Stat. 350, Chap. XII), 
        the 3rd Congress authorized the construction of six frigates as 
        the first ships to be built for the United States Navy.
            (2) One of the six frigates was built in Boston, 
        Massachusetts, between 1794 and 1797, and is the only one of the 
        original six ships to survive.
            (3) President George Washington named this frigate 
        ``Constitution'' to represent the Nation's founding document.
            (4) President Thomas Jefferson, asserting the right of the 
        United States to trade on the high seas, dispatched the frigate 
        Constitution in 1803 as the flagship of the Mediterranean 
        Squadron to end the depredations of the Barbary States against 
        United States ships and shipping, which led to a treaty being 
        signed with the Bashaw of Tripoli in the captain's cabin aboard 
        the frigate Constitution on June 4, 1805.
            (5) The frigate Constitution, with her defeat of the H.M.S. 
        Guerriere, secured the first major victory by the young United 
        States Navy against the Royal Navy during the War of 1812, 
        gaining in the process the nickname ``Old Ironsides'', which she 
        has proudly carried since.
            (6) Congress awarded gold medals to four of the ship's 
        commanding officers (Preble, Hull, Stewart, and Bainbridge), a 
        record unmatched by any other United States Navy vessel.
            (7) The frigate Constitution emerged from the War of 1812 
        undefeated, having secured victories over three additional ships 
        of the Royal Navy.
            (8) As early as May 1815, the frigate Constitution had 
        already been adopted as a symbol of the young Republic, as 
        attested by the [Washington] National Intelligencer which 
        proclaimed, ``Let us keep `Old Ironsides' at home. She has, 
        literally become the Nation's Ship . . . and should thus be 
        preserved . . . in honorable pomp, as a glorious Monument of her 
        own, and our other Naval Victories.''.
            (9) Rumors in 1830 that ``Old Ironsides'', an aging frigate, 
        was about to be scrapped resulted in a public uproar demanding 
        that the ship be restored and preserved, spurred by Oliver 
        Wendell Holmes' immortal poem ``Old Ironsides''.
            (10) ``Old Ironsides'' circumnavigated the world between 
        1844 and 1846, showing the American flag as she searched for 
        future coaling stations that would eventually fuel the steam-
        powered navy of the United States.
            (11) The first Pope to set foot on United States sovereign 
        territory was Pius IX onboard the frigate Constitution in 1849.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2446]]

            (12) On April 25, 1860, ``Old Ironsides'' evacuated the 
        midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy from Annapolis, 
        Maryland, to Newport, Rhode Island, preventing the young 
        officers and the esteemed ship from falling into Confederate 
        hands.
            (13) In 1896, Congressman John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald 
        introduced legislation to return ``Old Ironsides'' from the 
        Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in New Hampshire, where she was moored 
        pier side and largely forgotten, to Boston for her 100th 
        birthday.
            (14) Thousands of school children contributed pennies 
        between 1925 an 1927 to help fund a much needed restoration for 
        ``Old Ironsides''.
            (15) Between 1931 and 1934, more than 4,500,000 Americans 
        gained inspiration, at the depth of the Great Depression, by 
        going aboard ``Old Ironsides'' as she was towed to 76 ports on 
        the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts.
            (16) The 83rd Congress enacted the Act of July 23, 1954 (68 
        Stat. 527, chapter 565), which directed the Secretary of the 
        Navy to transfer to the States and appropriate commissions four 
        other historic ships then on the Navy inventory, and to repair 
        and equip the U.S.S. Constitution, as much as practicable, to 
        her original condition, but not for active service.
            (17) Queen Elizabeth II paid a formal visit to the U.S.S. 
        Constitution in 1976, at the start of her state visit marking 
        the bicentennial of the United States.
            (18) The U.S.S. Constitution, in celebration of her 
        bicentennial, returned to sea under sail on July 21, 1997, for 
        the first time since 1881, proudly setting sails purchased by 
        the contributions of thousands of pennies given by school 
        children across the United States.
            (19) The U.S.S. Constitution is the oldest commissioned 
        warship afloat in the world.
            (20) The U.S.S. Constitution is a national historic 
        landmark.
            (21) The U.S.S. Constitution continues to perform official, 
        ceremonial duties, including in recent years hosting a 
        congressional dinner honoring the late Senator John Chafee of 
        Rhode Island, a special salute for the dedication of the John 
        Moakley Federal Courthouse, a luncheon honoring British 
        Ambassador Sir David Manning, and a special underway 
        demonstration during which 60 Medal of Honor recipients each 
        received a personal Medal of Honor flag.
            (22) The U.S.S. Constitution celebrated on October 21, 2007, 
        the 210th anniversary of her launching.
            (23) The U.S.S. Constitution will remain a commissioned ship 
        in the United States Navy, with the Navy retaining control of 
        the ship, its material condition, and its employment.
            (24) The U.S.S. Constitution's primary mission will remain 
        education and public outreach, and any Ship of State functions 
        will be an adjunct to the ship's primary mission.

    (b) Designation as America's Ship of State.--
            (1) In general.--The U.S.S. Constitution is hereby 
        designated as ``America's Ship of State''.
            (2) References.--The U.S.S. Constitution may be known or 
        referred to as ``America's Ship of State''.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2447]]

            (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        President, Vice President, executive branch officials, and 
        members of Congress should use the U.S.S. Constitution for the 
        conducting of pertinent matters of state, such as hosting 
        visiting heads of state, signing legislation relating to the 
        Armed Forces, and signing maritime related treaties.
            (4) Fee or reimbursement structure for non-department of the 
        navy use.--The Secretary of the Navy shall determine an 
        appropriate fee or reimbursement structure for any non-
        Department of the Navy entities using the U.S.S. Constitution 
        for Ship of State purposes.
SEC. 1023. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN MINIMUM NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL

service of the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), the number of operational 
aircraft carriers in the naval combat forces of the Navy may be 10.

    (b) Evaluation and Report.--
            (1) Evaluation.--During fiscal year 2012, the Chairman of 
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the commanders 
        of the combatant commands, shall evaluate the required postures 
        and capabilities of each of the combatant commands to assess the 
        level of increased risk that could result due to a temporary 
        reduction in the total number of operational aircraft carriers 
        following the inactivation of the U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN-65).
            (2) Report to congress.--Together with the budget materials 
        submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in support of 
        the President's budget for fiscal year 2013, the Secretary of 
        Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a 
        report containing the findings of the evaluation conducted 
        pursuant to paragraph (1), and the basis for each such finding.
SEC. 1024. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE DISPOSITION OF 
                          SUBMARINE NR-1.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Deep Submergence Vessel NR-1 (hereinafter in this 
        section referred to as ``NR-1'') was built by the Electric Boat 
        Company in Groton, Connecticut, entered service in 1969, and was 
        the only nuclear-powered research submersible in the United 
        States Navy.
            (2) NR-1 was assigned to Naval Submarine Base New London, 
        located in Groton, Connecticut, throughout her entire service 
        life.
            (3) NR-1 was inactivated in December 2008.
            (4) Due to the unique capabilities of NR-1, it conducted 
        numerous missions of significant military and scientific value 
        most notably in the fields of geological survey and 
        oceanographic research.
            (5) In 1986, NR-1 played a key role in the search for and 
        recovery of the Space Shuttle Challenger.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2448]]

            (6) The mission of the Submarine Force Library and Museum in 
        Groton, Connecticut, is to collect, preserve, and interpret the 
        history of the United States Naval Submarine Force in order to 
        honor veterans and to educate naval personnel and the public in 
        the heritage and traditions of the Submarine Force.
            (7) NR-1 is a unique and irreplaceable part of the history 
        of the Navy and the Submarine Force and an educational and 
        historical asset that should be shared with the Nation and the 
        world.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) NR-1 is a unique and irreplaceable part of the Nation's

            (1) Section 5062(b) of title 10, United States Code, 
        requires the Department of the Navy to maintain not less than 11 
        operational aircraft carriers.
            (2) In repeated testimony before Congress, the Navy has 
        pledged its long-term commitment to naval combat forces that 
        include 11 operational aircraft carriers and 10 carrier air 
        wings, composed of 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in addition to the forces described in section 5062(b) 
        of title 10, United States Code, the Navy should meet its 
        current requirement for 10 carrier air wings (even if the number 
        of aircraft carriers is temporarily reduced) that are comprised 
        of not less than 44 strike-fighter aircraft, in addition to any 
        other aircraft associated with the air wing; and
            (2) the Congress and the Secretary of the Navy should take 
        all appropriate actions necessary to achieve the current 
        requirement for such carrier air wings until such time that 
        modifications to the carrier air wing force structure are 
        warranted and the Secretary of the Navy provides Congress with a 
        justification of any proposed modifications, supported by 
        rigorous and sufficient warfighting analysis.

    (a) Program Required. <<NOTE: Deadline. Study.>> --Not later than 
270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of

or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

    (b) Partnerships.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out the study by 
        partnering with nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations that--
                    (A) would not charge veterans who participate in the 
                study fees for the dogs, services, or lodging that they 
                provide; and
                    (B) are accredited by, or adhere to standards 
                comparable to those of, an accrediting organization with 
                demonstrated experience, national scope, and recognized 
                leadership and expertise in the training of service dogs 
                and education in the use of service dogs.
            (2) Reimbursement of costs.--The Secretary shall reimburse 
        partners $10,000 for each dog provided to a veteran who enrolls 
        in the study and successfully completes a training program

    (c) Participation.--
            (1) In general.--As part of the study, the Secretary shall, 
        subject to paragraph (2), arrange for the provision of a service 
        dog to the greater of the following:
                    (A) 200 veterans.
                    (B) A sufficient number of such veterans to produce 
                scientifically valid results with respect to assessing 
                the benefits and costs of the use of such dogs for the 
                treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans.
            (2) Number of veterans.--The Department of Veterans Affairs 
        may provide dogs to fewer than 200 veterans if, despite its 
        sustained and repeated efforts, it is unable to recruit 200 
        veterans to participate in the study referred to in subsection 
        (d).
            (3) Eligible veterans.--A veteran is eligible to enroll and

                or disabilities.

                determines, based on clinical evaluation of efficacy, 
                that the veteran is an appropriate candidate for the 
                study and may potentially benefit from a service dog.
                    (C) The veteran agrees to successfully complete a 
                training program arranged by the Department of Veterans 
                Affairs and offered by a nonprofit 501(c)(3) 
                organization that is accredited by, or adheres to 
                standards comparable to those of, an accrediting 
                organization with demonstrated experience, national 
                scope, and recognized leadership and expertise in the 
                training of service dogs and education in the use of 
                service dogs.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2478]]

                    (C) Payments and allowances for travel incurred in 
                becoming adjusted to the service dogs, to be paid in the 
                same manner that payments and allowances are authorized 
                under section 111 of title 38, United States Code, and 
                its implementing regulations.
            (6) Additional benefit for associated expenses.--As an 
        incentive for participation in the study, veterans participating 
        in the study will receive from the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs a monthly payment of $75 to offset costs associated with 
        the dog in addition to those identified in paragraph (5), such 
        as services not prescribed or performed by a veterinarian, 
        including but not limited to, license tags (if required), food, 
        grooming, nail trimming, boarding, and over-the-counter 
        medications.
            (7) Option for ownership of, and responsibility for, the dog 
        after the completion of the study.--At the end of the study the 
        veteran will have the option of ownership of the dog. If the 
        veteran does not wish to retain the dog, the 501(c)(3) 
        organization that provided the dog will be responsible for 
        caring for or appropriately placing the dog. In any case after 
        completion of the study, or if and when the veteran chooses to 
        not participate in the study until completion, further 
        responsibility by the Department of Veterans Affairs for any 
        benefits in this provision will cease. Further, the Department 
        of Veterans Affairs' liability related to the dog will cease.

service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with 
physical or mental injuries or disabilities. The matters studied shall

        quality of life benefits reported by the veterans partaking in 
        the study.

        treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans, including--

                veterans.

                instruction for military officers and noncommissioned 
                officers that promotes democracy, subordination to

SEC. 1230. REPORT ON FEASIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY OF ESTABLISHING 
                          GENERAL UNIFORM PROCEDURES AND 
                          GUIDELINES FOR THE PROVISION OF MONETARY 
                          ASSISTANCE BY THE UNITED STATES TO 
                          CIVILIAN FOREIGN NATIONALS FOR LOSSES 
                          INCIDENT TO COMBAT ACTIVITIES OF THE 
                          ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a 
report on the feasibility and the desirability of establishing general 
uniform procedures and guidelines for the provision by the United States 
of monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals for losses, 
injuries, or death (hereafter ``harm'') incident to combat activities of 
the United States Armed Forces.
    (b) Matters To Be Included in Report.--The Secretary shall include 
in the report the following:
            (1) A description of the authorities under laws in effect as 
        of the date of the enactment of this Act for the United States 
        to provide compensation, monetary payments, or other assistance 
        to civilians who incur harm due directly or indirectly to the 
        combat activities of the United States Armed Forces.
            (2) A description of the practices in effect as of the date 
        of enactment of this Act for the United States to provide ex 
        gratia, solatia, or other types of condolence payments to 
        civilians who incur harm due directly or indirectly to the 
        combat activities of the United States Armed Forces.
            (3) A discussion of the historic practice of the United 
        States to provide compensation, other monetary payments, or 
        other assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm 
        due directly or indirectly to combat activities of the United 
        States Armed Forces.
            (4) A discussion of the practice of the United States in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom to 
        provide compensation, other monetary payments, or other 
        assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm due 
        directly or indirectly to the combat activities of the United 
        States Armed Forces, including the procedures and guidelines 
        used and an assessment of its effectiveness. This discussion 
        will also include estimates of the total amount of funds 
        disbursed to civilian foreign nationals who have incurred harm 
        since the inception of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
        Enduring Freedom. This discussion will also include how such 
        procedures and guidelines compare to the processing of claims 
        filed under the Foreign Claims Act.
            (5) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of 
        using different authorities, procedures, and guidelines to 
        provide monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals, based 
        upon the culture and economic circumstances of the local 
        populace and the operational impact on the military mission. 
        This discussion will also include whether the use of different 
        authorities, procedures, and guidelines has resulted in 
        disparate monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals who 
        have incurred substantially similar harm, and if so, the 
        frequency and effect of such results.
            (6) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of 
        establishing general uniform procedures and guidelines for the

[[Page 123 STAT. 2530]]

        provision of such assistance, based upon the goals of timely 
        commencement of a program of monetary assistance, efficient and 
        effective implementation of such program, and consistency in the 
        amount of assistance in relation to the harm incurred. This 
        discussion will also include whether the implementation of 
        general uniform procedures and guidelines would create a legally 
        enforceable entitlement to ``compensation'' and, if so, any 
        potential significant operational impact arising from such an 
        entitlement.
            (7) Assuming general uniform procedures and guidelines were 
        to be established, a discussion of the following:
                    (A) Whether such assistance should be limited to 
                specified types of combat activities or operations, 
                e.g., such as during counterinsurgency operations.
                    (B) Whether such assistance should be contingent 
                upon a formal determination that a particular combat 
                activity/operation is a qualifying activity, and the 
                criteria, if any, for such a determination.
                    (C) Whether a time limit from the date of loss for 
                providing such assistance should be prescribed.
                    (D) Whether only monetary or other types of 
                assistance should be authorized, and what types of 
                nonmonetary assistance, if any, should be authorized.
                    (E) Whether monetary value limits should be placed 
                on the assistance that may be provided, or whether the 
                determination to provide assistance and, if so, the 
                monetary value of such assistance, should be based, in 
                whole or in part, on a legal advisor's assessment of the 
                facts.
                    (F) Whether a written record of the determination to 
                provide or to not provide such assistance should be 
                maintained and a copy made available to the civilian 
                foreign national.
                    (G) Whether in the event of a determination to not 
                provide such assistance the civilian foreign national 
                should be afforded the option of a review of the 
                determination by a higher ranking authority.

    (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in the report such 
recommendations as the Secretary considers appropriate for legislative 
or administrative action with respect to the matters discussed in the 
report.

SEC. 1249. PATRIOT AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE BATTERY IN POLAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On August 20, 2008, representatives of the governments 
        of the United States and Poland signed the ``Declaration on 
        Strategic Cooperation between the United States of America and 
        the Republic of Poland''.
            (2) The Declaration on Strategic Cooperation states, among 
        other things, that the ``United States and Poland intend to 
        expand air and missile defense cooperation. In this regard, we 
        have agreed on an important new area of such cooperation 
        involving the deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air and missile 
        defense battery in Poland. We intend to begin this cooperation 
        next year and to expand it with the aim of establishing by 2012 
        a garrison to support the U.S. Army Patriot battery. The 
        Government of Poland intends to provide an appropriate

[[Page 123 STAT. 2548]]

        site, infrastructure, and facilities for this garrison 
        acceptable to both parties. Our cooperation in this area will 
        include joint training opportunities that will enhance Polish 
        air defense capabilities. In the coming months, we intend to 
        reach agreement on the specific arrangements that will enable 
        this cooperation to begin. These steps reflect the commitment of 
        the United States to an expanded defense relationship with 
        Poland.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States and Poland should seek to implement the terms of the Declaration 
on Strategic Cooperation, including cooperation on the deployment of a 
United States Army Patriot air and missile defense battery in Poland.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees a report describing the status of cooperation on the 
deployment of a United States Army Patriot air and missile defense 
battery in Poland. The report shall be in unclassified form, but may 
include a classified annex.

        re-listing North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism would

                and multilateral sanctions against North Korea in 
                furtherance of United States national security;
            (2) the conduct of North Korea constitutes a threat to the 
        northeast Asian region and to international peace and security;

            (3) if the United States determines that the Government of 
        North Korea has provided assistance to terrorists or engaged in 
        state sponsored acts of terrorism, the Secretary of State should 
        immediately list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.

trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the

its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically 
provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of

commissions. The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of 
this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its own force binding 
on military commissions established under this chapter.

provisions of this title shall not apply to trial by military commission 
under this chapter:

to try persons subject to this chapter for any offense made punishable 
by this chapter, sections 904 and 906 of this title (articles 104 and 
106 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), or the law of war, whether 
such offense was committed before, on, or after September 11, 2001, and 
may, under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any 
punishment not forbidden by this chapter, including the penalty of death 
when specifically authorized under this chapter. A military commission

        have jurisdiction thereof.

    ``(b) Disclosure of Exculpatory Evidence.--(1) As soon as 
practicable, trial counsel in a military commission under this chapter

of guilt, disclose to the defense the existence of evidence that is not 
subject to paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) but that reasonably may be

commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a 
result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate 
the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease 
or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

this chapter has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental 
responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.
    ``(c) Findings Following Assertion of Defense.--Whenever lack of 
mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is 
properly at issue in a military commission under this chapter, the 
military judge shall instruct the members as to the defense of lack of 
mental responsibility under this section and shall charge the members to 
find the accused--
            ``(1) guilty;

responsibility of the accused) is conclusive and constitutes the ruling 
of the military commission. However, a military judge may change such a 
ruling at any time during the trial.
    ``(c) Instructions Prior to Vote.--Before a vote is taken of the 
findings of a military commission under this chapter, the military judge 
shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members 
as to the elements of the offense and charge the members--
            ``(1) that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until 
        the accused's guilt is established by legal and competent 
        evidence beyond a reasonable doubt;

        reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must 
        be resolved in favor of the accused and the accused must be

        a motion of the trial counsel if the military judge finds that

        provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to 
        make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified 
        information.

        hearing on any motion under this subsection. Any such hearing 
        shall be held in camera at the request of a knowledgeable United 
        States official possessing authority to classify information.

        if disclosure ordered.-- <<NOTE: Certification.>> The trial 
        counsel may, in connection with a motion under paragraph (1), 
        submit to the military judge a declaration signed by a 
        knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to 
        classify information certifying that disclosure of classified 
        information would cause identifiable damage to the national 
        security of the United States and explaining the basis for the 
        classification of such information. If so requested by the trial 
        counsel, the military judge shall examine such declaration 
        during an ex parte presentation.

    ``(e) Sealing of Records of in Camera Hearings.--If at the close of 
an in camera hearing under this section (or any portion of a hearing 
under this section that is held in camera), the military judge 
determines that the classified information at issue may not be disclosed 
or elicited at the trial or pretrial proceeding, the record of such in 
camera hearing shall be sealed and preserved for use in the event of an 
appeal. The accused may seek reconsideration of the military judge's 
determination prior to or during trial.

Accused; Relief for Accused When the United States Opposes Disclosure.--

        not be served by dismissal of the case, the military judge shall 
        order such other action, in lieu of dismissing the charge or 
        specification, as the military judge determines is appropriate.

        appeal.--An order under paragraph (2) shall not take effect 
        until the military judge has afforded the United States--

                section 950d of this title; and

                objection to the disclosure of the classified

            ``(1) Disclosure of rebuttal information.--Whenever the 
        military judge determines that classified information may be 
        disclosed in connection with a trial or pretrial proceeding, the 
        military judge shall, unless the interests of fairness do not so 
        require, order the United States to provide the accused with the 
        information it expects to use to rebut the classified 
        information. The military judge may place the United States 
        under a continuing duty to disclose such rebuttal information.
            ``(2) Sanction for failure to comply.--If the United States 
        fails to comply with its obligation under this subsection, the 
        military judge--

and photographs containing classified information may be admitted into 
evidence in proceedings of military commissions under this chapter 
without change in their classification status.
    ``(b) Precautions by Military Judges.--
            ``(1) Precautions in admitting classified information into 
        evidence.--The military judge in a trial by military commission, 
        in order to prevent unnecessary disclosure of classified 
        information, may order admission into evidence of only part of a 
        writing, recording, or photograph, or may order admission into 
        evidence of the whole writing, recording, or photograph with 
        excision of some or all of the classified information contained 
        therein, unless the whole ought in fairness be considered.

        judge shall allow classified information offered or accepted 
        into evidence to remain under seal during the trial, even if 
        such evidence is disclosed in the military commission, and may, 
        upon motion by the United States, seal exhibits containing 
        classified information for any period after trial as necessary 
        to prevent a disclosure of classified information when a 
        knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to 
        classify information submits to the military judge a declaration 
        setting forth the damage to the national security that the 
        disclosure of such information reasonably could be expected to 
        cause.

            ``(1) Objection by trial counsel.--During the examination of 
        a witness, trial counsel may object to any question or line of 
        inquiry that may require the witness to disclose classified 
        information not previously found to be admissible.
            ``(2) Action by military judge.--Following an objection 
        under paragraph (1), the military judge shall take such suitable 
        action to determine whether the response is admissible as will 
        safeguard against the compromise of any classified information. 
        Such action may include requiring trial counsel to provide the 
        military judge with a proffer of the witness' response to the 
        question or line of inquiry and requiring the accused to provide 
        the military judge with a proffer of the nature of the 
        information sought to be elicited by the accused. Upon request, 
        the military judge may accept an ex parte proffer by trial 
        counsel to the extent necessary to protect classified 
        information from disclosure, in accordance with the practice of 
        the Federal courts under the Classified Information Procedures 
        Act (18 U.S.C. App.).

Witness.--

        witness in the possession of the United States which relate to 
        the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. This 
        paragraph does not preclude discovery or assertion of a 
        privilege otherwise authorized.

        United States invokes a privilege, the trial counsel may provide 
        the prior statements of the witness to the military judge during

        classified information from disclosure, in accordance with the 
        practice of the Federal courts under the Classified Information 
        Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.).

        judge finds that disclosure of any portion of the statement 
        identified by the United States as classified would be 
        detrimental to the national security in the degree to warrant 
        classification under the applicable Executive Order, statute, or 
        regulation, that such portion of the statement is consistent 
        with the testimony of the witness, and that the disclosure of

        military judge, shall, upon the request of the trial counsel, 
        review alternatives to disclosure in accordance with section

``Sec. 950p. Definitions; construction of certain offenses; common 
                  circumstances

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this subchapter:
            ``(1) The term `military objective' means combatants and 
        those objects during hostilities which, by their nature, 
        location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to the war-
        fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing force and 
        whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization 
        would constitute a definite military advantage to the attacker 
        under the circumstances at the time of an attack.
            ``(2) The term `protected person' means any person entitled 
        to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions, 
        including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities, 
        military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, or 
        detention, and military medical or religious personnel.
            ``(3) The term `protected property' means any property 
        specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings 
        dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable 
        purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the 
        sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent 
        such property is not being used for military purposes or is not 
        otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects 
        properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the 
        Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property that 
        is a military objective.

    ``(b) Construction of Certain Offenses.--The intent required for 
offenses under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (12) of section 950t 
of this title precludes the applicability of such offenses with regard 
to collateral damage or to death, damage, or injury incident to a lawful 
attack.
    ``(c) Common Circumstances.--An offense specified in this subchapter 
is triable by military commission under this chapter only if the offense 
is committed in the context of and associated with hostilities.
    ``(d) Effect.--The provisions of this subchapter codify offenses 
that have traditionally been triable by military commission. This 
chapter does not establish new crimes that did not exist before the date 
of the enactment of this subchapter, as amended by the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, but rather codifies those crimes 
for trial by military commission. Because the provisions of this 
subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable under 
the law of war or otherwise triable by military commission, this 
subchapter does not preclude trial for offenses that occurred before the 
date of the enactment of this subchapter, as so amended.
``Sec. 950q. Principals

    ``Any person punishable under this chapter who--
            ``(1) commits an offense punishable by this chapter, or 
        aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission;
            ``(2) causes an act to be done which if directly performed 
        by him would be punishable by this chapter; or
            ``(3) is a superior commander who, with regard to acts 
        punishable by this chapter, knew, had reason to know, or

[[Page 123 STAT. 2607]]

        should have known, that a subordinate was about to commit such 
        acts or had done so and who failed to take the necessary and 
        reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the 
        perpetrators thereof,

is a principal.
``Sec. 950r. Accessory after the fact

    ``Any person subject to this chapter who, knowing that an offense 
punishable by this chapter has been committed, receives, comforts, or 
assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, 
trial, or punishment shall be punished as a military commission under 
this chapter may direct.
``Sec. 950s. Conviction of lesser offenses

    ``An accused may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included 
in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense 
charged or an attempt to commit either the offense charged or an offense 
necessarily included therein.
``Sec. 950t. Crimes triable by military commission

    ``The following offenses shall be triable by military commission 
under this chapter at any time without limitation:

        this chapter who intentionally kills one or more protected 
        persons shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a

        chapter who intentionally engages in an attack upon a civilian 
        population as such, or individual civilians not taking active 
        part in hostilities, shall be punished, if death results to one 
        or more of the victims, by death or such other punishment as a 
        military commission under this chapter may direct, and, if death 
        does not result to any of the victims, by such punishment, other 
        than death, as a military commission under this chapter may 
        direct.

        this chapter who intentionally engages in an attack upon a 
        civilian object that is not a military objective shall be 
        punished as a military commission under this chapter may direct.
            ``(4) Attacking protected property.--Any person subject to 
        this chapter who intentionally engages in an attack upon 
        protected property shall be punished as a military commission

        who, with effective command or control over subordinate groups, 
        declares, orders, or otherwise indicates to those groups that 
        there shall be no survivors or surrender accepted, with the 
        intent to threaten an adversary or to conduct hostilities such 
        that there would be no survivors or surrender accepted, shall be 
        punished as a military commission under this chapter may direct.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2608]]

            ``(7) Taking hostages.--Any person subject to this chapter 
        who, having knowingly seized or detained one or more persons, 
        threatens to kill, injure, or continue to detain such person or 
        persons with the intent of compelling any nation, person other

        acting as an explicit or implicit condition for the safety or 
        release of such person or persons, shall be punished, if death

                order to obtain or retain the services of persons 
                specified by statute; and

SEC. 1914. <<NOTE: President.>> TRANSITION SCHEDULE FOR LOCALITY-
                          BASED COMPARABILITY PAYMENTS.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle or section 
5304 or 5304a of title 5, United States Code, in implementing the 
amendments made by this subtitle, for each non-foreign area determined

SEC. 1915. SAVINGS PROVISION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the application of this subtitle to any employee should 
        not result in a decrease in the take home pay of that employee;
            (2) in calendar year 2012 and each subsequent year, no 
        employee shall receive less than the Rest of the U.S. locality 
        pay rate;

[[Page 123 STAT. 2622]]

            (3) concurrent with the surveys next conducted under the 
        provisions of section 5304(d)(1)(A) of title 5, United States 
        Code, beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Bureau of Labor Statistics should conduct separate surveys to 
        determine the extent of any pay disparity (as defined by section 
        5302 of that title) that may exist with respect to positions 
        located in the State of Alaska, the State of Hawaii, and the 
        United States territories, including American Samoa, Guam, 
        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Commonwealth of 
        Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands;
            (4) if the surveys under paragraph (3) indicate that the pay 
        disparity determined for the State of Alaska, the State of 
        Hawaii, or any 1 of the United States territories including 
        American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
        Islands, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States 
        Virgin Islands exceeds the pay disparity determined for the 
        locality which (for purposes of section 5304 of that title) is 
        commonly known as the ``Rest of the United States'', the 
        President's Pay Agent should take appropriate measures to 
        provide that each such surveyed area be treated as a separate 
        pay locality for purposes of that section; and
            (5) the President's Pay Agent will establish 1 locality area 
        for the entire State of Hawaii and 1 locality area for the 
        entire State of Alaska.

    (b) Savings Provisions.--
            (1) In general.-- <<NOTE: Time period.>> During the 
        transition period described in section 1914 ending on the first 
        day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 
        2012, an employee paid a special rate under 5305 of title 5, 
        United States Code, who the day before the date of enactment of 
        this Act was eligible to receive a cost-of-living allowance 
        under section 5941 of title 5, United States Code, and who 
        continues to be officially stationed in an allowance area, shall 
        receive an increase in the employee's special rate consistent 
        with increases in the applicable special rate schedule. For 
        employees in allowance areas, the minimum step rate for any 
        grade of a special rate schedule shall be increased at the time 
        of an increase in the applicable locality rate percentage for 
        the allowance area by not less than the dollar increase in the 
        locality-based comparability payment for a non-special rate 
        employee at the same minimum step provided under section 1914 of 
        this subtitle, and corresponding increases shall be provided for 
        all step rates of the given pay range.
            (2) Continuation of cost of living allowance rate.--If an 
        employee, who the day before the date of enactment of this Act 
        was eligible to receive a cost-of-living allowance under section 
        5941 of title 5, United States Code, would receive a rate of 
        basic pay and applicable locality-based comparability payment 
        which is in excess of the maximum rate limitation set under 
        section 5304(g) of title 5, United States Code, for his position 
        (but for that maximum rate limitation) due to the operation of 
        this subtitle, the employee shall continue to receive the cost-
        of-living allowance rate in effect on December 31, 2009 without 
        adjustment until--
                    (A) the employee leaves the allowance area or pay 
                system; or

[[Page 123 STAT. 2623]]

                    (B) the employee is entitled to receive basic pay 
                (including any applicable locality-based comparability 
                payment or similar supplement) at a higher rate,
        but, when any such position becomes vacant, the pay of any 
        subsequent appointee thereto shall be fixed in the manner 
        provided by applicable law and regulation.
            (3) Locality-based comparability payments.--Any employee 
        covered under paragraph (2) shall receive any applicable 
        locality-based comparability payment extended under section 1914 
        of this subtitle which is not in excess of the maximum rate set 
        under section 5304(g) of title 5, United States Code, for his 
        position including any future increase to statutory pay 
        limitations under 5318 of title 5, United States Code. 
        Notwithstanding paragraph (2), to the extent that an employee 
        covered under that paragraph receives any amount of locality-
        based comparability payment, the cost-of-living allowance rate 
        under that paragraph shall be reduced accordingly, as provided 
        under section 5941(c)(2)(B) of title 5, United States Code.

        improvements to nearby intersections, on-base queuing options,

        impact need to be pursued to ensure readily available access to 
        health care at the installation.

        Region'' has the meaning given the term in section 2674(f) of

of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title 
XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) is amended--

SEC. 3144. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PRODUCTION OF MOLYBDENUM-99.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are fewer than five reactors around the world 
        currently capable of producing molybdenum-99 (in this section 
        referred to as ``Mo-99'') and there are no such reactors in the 
        United States that can provide a reliable supply of Mo-99 to 
        meet medical needs.
            (2) Since November 2007, there have been major disruptions 
        in the global availability of Mo-99, including at facilities in 
        Canada and the Netherlands, which have led to shortages of Mo-
        99-based medical products in the United States and around the 
        world.
            (3) Ensuring a reliable supply of medical radioisotopes, 
        including Mo-99, is of great importance to the public health.
            (4) It is also a national security priority of the United 
        States, and specifically of the Department of Energy, to 
        encourage the production of low-enriched uranium-based 
        radioisotopes in order to promote a more peaceful international 
        nuclear order.

[[Page 123 STAT. 2717]]

            (5) The National Academy of Sciences has identified a need 
        to establish a reliable capability in the United States for the 
        production of Mo-99 and its derivatives for medical purposes 
        using low-enriched uranium.
            (6) There also exists a capable industrial base in the 
        United States that can support the development of Mo-99 
        production facilities and can conduct the processing and 
        distribution of radiopharmaceutical products for use in medical 
        tests worldwide.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, including Mo-99 
        and its derivatives, are essential components of medical tests 
        that help diagnose and treat life-threatening diseases affecting 
        millions of people each year; and
            (2) the Secretary of Energy should continue and expand a 
        program to meet the need identified by the National Academy of 
        Sciences to ensure a source of Mo-99 and its derivatives for use 
        in medical tests to help ensure the health security of the 
        United States and around the world and promote peaceful nuclear 
        industries through the use of low-enriched uranium.

SEC. 3516. <<NOTE: 49 USC 109 note.>> EXPANSION OF THE MARINE VIEW 
                          SYSTEM.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Marine transportation system.--The term ``marine 
        transportation system'' means the navigable water transportation 
        system of the United States, including the vessels, ports (and 
        intermodal connections thereto), and shipyards and other vessel 
        repair facilities that are components of that system.
            (2) Marine view system.--The term ``Marine View system'' 
        means the information system of the Maritime Administration 
        known as Marine View.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to expand the Marine View system; and
            (2) to provide support for the strategic requirements of the 
        marine transportation system and its contribution to the 
        economic viability of the United States.

    (c) Expansion of Marine View System.--To accomplish the purposes of 
this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall expand the Marine 
View system so that such system is able to identify, collect, integrate, 
secure, protect, store, and securely distribute throughout the marine 
transportation system information that--
            (1) provides access to many disparate marine transportation 
        system data sources;
            (2) enables a system-wide view of the marine transportation 
        system;
            (3) fosters partnerships between the Government of the 
        United States and private entities;
            (4) facilitates accurate and efficient modeling of the 
        entire marine transportation system environment;
            (5) monitors and tracks threats to the marine transportation 
        system, including areas of severe weather or reported piracy; 
        and
            (6) provides vessel tracking and rerouting, as appropriate, 
        to ensure that the economic viability of the United States 
        waterways is maintained.

SEC. 4701. <<NOTE: 18 USC 1 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This division may be cited as the ``Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act''.
SEC. 4702. <<NOTE: 18 USC 249 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or 
        perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, or disability of the victim poses 
        a serious national problem.
            (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of 
        communities and is deeply divisive.
            (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue to 
        be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority of 
        violent crimes in the United States, including violent crimes 
        motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out their 
        responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal 
        assistance.
            (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this 
        problem.
            (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated 
        by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and the 
        family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages the 
        community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be 
        selected.
            (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce 
        in many ways, including the following:

[[Page 123 STAT. 2836]]

                    (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is 
                impeded, and members of such groups are forced to move 
                across State lines to escape the incidence or risk of 
                such violence.
                    (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from 
                purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining 
                employment, or participating in other commercial 
                activity.
                    (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such 
                violence.
                    (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of 
                interstate commerce are used to facilitate the 
                commission of such violence.
                    (E) Such violence is committed using articles that 
                have traveled in interstate commerce.
            (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and 
        involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and 
        ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary 
        servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of 
        the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, 
        through widespread public and private violence directed at 
        persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or perceived 
        race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially 
        motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the 
        extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery 
        and involuntary servitude.
            (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
        amendments to the Constitution of the United States were 
        adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious 
        and national origin groups were and are perceived to be distinct 
        ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, 
        the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to 
        prohibit assaults on the basis of real or perceived religions or 
        national origins, at least to the extent such religions or 
        national origins were regarded as races at the time of the 
        adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the 
        Constitution of the United States.
            (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes 
        motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
        to work together as partners in the investigation and 
        prosecution of such crimes.
            (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently 
        serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant 
        Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, and Indian 
        tribes.
SEC. 4703. DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and

SEC. 4704. <<NOTE: 42 USC 3716.>> SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL 
                          INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS BY 
                          STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
                          OFFICIALS.

    (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--
            (1) In general.--At the request of a State, local, or tribal 
        law enforcement agency, the Attorney General may provide 
        technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of 
        assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of any 
        crime that--
                    (A) constitutes a crime of violence;
                    (B) constitutes a felony under the State, local, or 
                tribal laws; and
                    (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the actual or 
                perceived race, color, religion, national origin, 
                gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
                disability of the victim, or is a violation of the 
                State, local, or tribal hate crime laws.
            (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), 
        the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed by 
        offenders who have committed crimes in more than one State and 
        to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the 
        extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or 
        prosecution of the crime.

    (b) Grants.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to 
        State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies for 
        extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation and 
        prosecution of hate crimes.
            (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant 
        program under this subsection, the Office of Justice Programs

        compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), 
        speech, expression, or association, unless the Government

        least restrictive means of furthering that compelling 
        governmental interest, if such exercise of religion, speech, 
        expression, or association was not intended to--
                    (A) plan or prepare for an act of physical violence;

        espousing such beliefs.
            (5) First amendment.--Nothing in this division, or an 
        amendment made by this division, shall be construed to diminish

        shall be construed to prohibit any constitutionally protected 
        speech, expressive conduct or activities (regardless of whether 
        compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief), 
        including the exercise of religion protected by the first 
        amendment to the Constitution of the United States and peaceful 
        picketing or demonstration. The Constitution of the United 
        States does not protect speech, conduct or activities consisting 
        of planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of 
        violence.
