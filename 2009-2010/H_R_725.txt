SEC. 202. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2801 note.>>  FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust 
        obligations to provide for the public safety of Indian country;
            (2) Congress and the President have acknowledged that--
                    (A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the 
                first responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and
                    (B) tribal justice systems are often the most 
                appropriate institutions for maintaining law and order 
                in Indian country;
            (3) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement 
        officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, 
        which reflects less than \1/2\ of the law enforcement presence 
        in comparable rural communities nationwide;
            (4) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in 
        Indian country--
                    (A) has a significant negative impact on the ability 
                to provide public safety to Indian communities;
                    (B) has been increasingly exploited by criminals; 
                and
                    (C) requires a high degree of commitment and 
                cooperation among tribal, Federal, and State law 
                enforcement officials;
            (5)(A) domestic and sexual violence against American Indian 
        and Alaska Native women has reached epidemic proportions;
            (B) 34 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women 
        will be raped in their lifetimes; and
            (C) 39 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women 
        will be subject to domestic violence;
            (6) Indian tribes have faced significant increases in 
        instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child 
        abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on 
        Indian reservations; and

[[Page 124 STAT. 2263]]

            (7) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, but 
        for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of 
        Justice have not been able to coordinate or consistently report 
        crime and prosecution rates in tribal communities.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, 
        tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes committed 
        in Indian country;
            (2) to increase coordination and communication among 
        Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;
            (3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, 
        resources, and information necessary to safely and effectively 
        provide public safety in Indian country;
            (4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in Indian 
        country and to combat sexual and domestic violence against 
        American Indian and Alaska Native women;
            (5) to prevent drug trafficking and reduce rates of alcohol 
        and drug addiction in Indian country; and
            (6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal 
        data and the sharing of criminal history information among 
        Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for responding 
        to and investigating crimes in Indian country.

                    ``(C) any other person responsible for investigating
