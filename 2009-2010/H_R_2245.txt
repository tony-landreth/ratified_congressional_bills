        lunar landing mission, Neil A. Armstrong gained the distinction 
        of being the first man to land a craft on the moon and first to 
        step on its surface on July 21, 1969;
            (2) by conquering the moon at great personal risk to safety, 
        Neil Armstrong advanced America scientifically and 
        technologically, paving the way for future missions to other 
        regions in space;
            (3) Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., joined Armstrong in 
        piloting the lunar module, Eagle, to the surface of the moon, 
        and became the second person to walk upon its surface;
            (4) Michael Collins piloted the command module, Columbia, in 
        lunar orbit and helped his fellow Apollo 11 astronauts complete 
        their mission on the moon;
            (5) John Herschel Glenn, Jr., helped pave the way for the 
        first lunar landing when on February 20, 1962, he became the 
        first American to orbit the Earth; and
            (6) John Glenn's actions, like Armstrong's, Aldrin's and 
        Collins's, continue to greatly inspire the people of the United 
        States.
