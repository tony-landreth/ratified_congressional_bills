Public Law 111-154
111th Congress

                                 An Act


 
 To prevent tobacco smuggling, to ensure the collection of all tobacco 
  taxes, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Mar. 31, 2010 -  [S. 1147]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Prevent All 
Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) <<NOTE: 15 USC 375 note.>> Short Title.--This Act may be cited 
as the ``Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009'' or ``PACT 
Act''.

    (b) <<NOTE: 15 USC 375 note.>>  Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 
        products significantly reduces Federal, State, and local 
        government revenues, with Internet sales alone accounting for 
        billions of dollars of lost Federal, State, and local tobacco 
        tax revenue each year;
            (2) Hezbollah, Hamas, al Qaeda, and other terrorist 
        organizations have profited from trafficking in illegal 
        cigarettes or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps;
            (3) terrorist involvement in illicit cigarette trafficking 
        will continue to grow because of the large profits such 
        organizations can earn;
            (4) the sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 
        over the Internet, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, makes 
        it cheaper and easier for children to obtain tobacco products;
            (5) the majority of Internet and other remote sales of 
        cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are being made without adequate 
        precautions to protect against sales to children, without the 
        payment of applicable taxes, and without complying with the 
        nominal registration and reporting requirements in existing 
        Federal law;
            (6) unfair competition from illegal sales of cigarettes and 
        smokeless tobacco is taking billions of dollars of sales away 
        from law-abiding retailers throughout the United States;
            (7) with rising State and local tobacco tax rates, the 
        incentives for the illegal sale of cigarettes and smokeless 
        tobacco have increased;
            (8) the number of active tobacco investigations being 
        conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
        Explosives rose to 452 in 2005;
            (9) the number of Internet vendors in the United States and 
        in foreign countries that sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 
        to buyers in the United States increased from only about 40 in 
        2000 to more than 500 in 2005; and

[[Page 124 STAT. 1088]]

            (10) the intrastate sale of illegal cigarettes and smokeless 
        tobacco over the Internet has a substantial effect on interstate 
        commerce.

    (c) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) require Internet and other remote sellers of cigarettes 
        and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws that apply to 
        law-abiding tobacco retailers;
            (2) create strong disincentives to illegal smuggling of 
        tobacco products;
            (3) provide government enforcement officials with more 
        effective enforcement tools to combat tobacco smuggling;
            (4) make it more difficult for cigarette and smokeless 
        tobacco traffickers to engage in and profit from their illegal 
        activities;
            (5) increase collections of Federal, State, and local excise 
        taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco; and
            (6) prevent and reduce youth access to inexpensive 
        cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through illegal Internet or 
        contraband sales.

SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT OF 
                    THIS ACT.

    It is the sense of Congress that unique harms are associated with 
online cigarette sales, including problems with verifying the ages of 
consumers in the digital market and the long-term health problems 
associated with the use of certain tobacco products. This Act was 
enacted recognizing the longstanding interest of Congress in urging 
compliance with States' laws regulating remote sales of certain tobacco 
products to citizens of those States, including the passage of the 
Jenkins Act over 50 years ago, which established reporting requirements 
for out-of-State companies that sell certain tobacco products to 
citizens of the taxing States, and which gave authority to the 
Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives to enforce the Jenkins Act. In light of the unique harms and 
circumstances surrounding the online sale of certain tobacco products, 
this Act is intended to help collect cigarette excise taxes, to stop 
tobacco sales to underage youth, and to help the States enforce their 
laws that target the online sales of certain tobacco products only. This 
Act is in no way meant to create a precedent regarding the collection of 
State sales or use taxes by, or the validity of efforts to impose other 
types of taxes on, out-of-State entities that do not have a physical 
presence within the taxing State.

    Approved March 31, 2010.
