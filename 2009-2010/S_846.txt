Public Law 111-253
111th Congress

                                 An Act


 
     To award a congressional gold medal to Dr. Muhammad Yunus, in 
      recognition of his contributions to the fight against global 
              poverty. <<NOTE: Oct. 5, 2010 -  [S. 846]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: 31 USC 5111 
note.>> 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) Dr. Muhammad Yunus is recognized in the United States 
        and throughout the world as a leading figure in the fight 
        against poverty and the effort to promote economic and social 
        change;
            (2) Muhammad Yunus is the recognized developer of the 
        concept of microcredit, and Grameen Bank, which he founded, has 
        created a model of lending that has been emulated across the 
        globe;
            (3) Muhammad Yunus launched this global movement to create 
        economic and social development from below, beginning in 1976, 
        with a loan of $27 from his own pocket to 42 crafts persons in a 
        small village in Bangladesh;
            (4) Muhammad Yunus has demonstrated the life-changing 
        potential of extending very small loans (at competitive interest 
        rates) to the very poor and the economic feasibility of 
        microcredit and other microfinance and microenterprise practices 
        and services;
            (5) Dr. Yunus's work has had a particularly strong impact on 
        improving the economic prospects of women, and on their 
        families, as over 95 percent of microcredit borrowers are women;
            (6) Dr. Yunus has pioneered a movement with the potential to 
        assist a significant number of the more than 1,400,000,000 
        people, mostly women and children, who live on less than $1.25 a 
        day, and the 2,600,000,000 people who live on less than $2 a 
        day, and which has already reached 155,000,000, by one estimate;
            (7) there are now an estimated 24,000,000 microenterprises 
        in the United States accounting for approximately 18 percent of 
        private (nonfarm) employment and 87 percent of all business in 
        the United States, and the Small Business Administration has 
        made over $318,000,000 in microloans to entrepreneurs since 
        1992;
            (8) Dr. Yunus, along with the Grameen Bank, was awarded the 
        Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to promote economic 
        and social opportunity and out of recognition that lasting peace 
        cannot be achieved unless large population groups find the 
        means, such as microcredit, to break out of poverty; and

[[Page 124 STAT. 2636]]

            (9) the microcredit ideas developed and put into practice by 
        Muhammad Yunus, along with other bold initiatives, can make a 
        historical breakthrough in the fight against poverty.

global poverty.
