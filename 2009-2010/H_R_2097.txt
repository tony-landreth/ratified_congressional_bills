Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) During the Battle for Baltimore of the War of 1812, 
        Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in the Chesapeake 
        Bay on September 7, 1814, to secure the release of Dr. William 
        Beanes, who had been captured after the British burned 
        Washington, DC.
            (2) The release of Dr. Beanes was secured, but Key and 
        Beanes were held by the British during the shelling of Fort 
        McHenry, one of the forts defending Baltimore.
            (3) On the morning of September 14, 1814, after the 25-hour 
        British bombardment of Fort McHenry, Key peered through the 
        clearing smoke to see a 42-foot by 30-foot American flag flying 
        proudly atop the Fort.
            (4) He was so inspired to see the enormous flag still flying 
        over the Fort that he began penning a song, which he named The 
        Defence of Fort McHenry, to commemorate the occasion and he 
        included a note that it should be sung to the tune of the 
        popular British melody To Anacreon in Heaven.
            (5) In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the 
        anthem, which had been popularly renamed the Star-Spangled 
        Banner, be played at military and naval occasions.
            (6) On March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed a 
        resolution of Congress that officially designated the Star-
        Spangled Banner as the National Anthem of the United States.
