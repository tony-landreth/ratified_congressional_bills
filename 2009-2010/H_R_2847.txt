to such person's return of tax imposed by subtitle A for such taxable 
year the information described in subsection (c) with respect to each 
such asset if the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $50,000 (or 
such higher dollar amount as the Secretary may prescribe).
    ``(b) Specified Foreign Financial Assets.--For purposes of this 
section, the term `specified foreign financial asset' means--

        1471(d)(2)) maintained by a foreign financial institution (as 
        defined in section 1471(d)(4)), and
            ``(2) any of the following assets which are not held in an 
        account maintained by a financial institution (as defined in

        information described in subsection (c) with respect to any 
        taxable year at the time and in the manner described in 
        subsection (a), such person shall pay a penalty of $10,000.

            ``(2) Increase in penalty where failure continues after 
        notification.--If <<NOTE: Time period.>> any failure described 
        in paragraph (1) continues for more than 90 days after the day 
        on which the Secretary mails notice of such failure to the 
        individual, such individual shall pay a penalty (in addition to 
        the penalties under paragraph (1)) of $10,000 for each 30-day 
        period (or fraction thereof) during which such failure continues 
        after the expiration of such 90-day period. The penalty imposed 
        under this paragraph with respect to any failure shall not

        financial assets, and

        information to demonstrate the aggregate value of such assets,

excess of $50,000 (or such higher dollar amount as the Secretary 
prescribes for purposes of subsection (a)) for purposes of assessing the 
penalties imposed under this section.
    ``(f) Application to Certain Entities.--To the extent provided by 
the Secretary in regulations or other guidance, the provisions of this 
section shall apply to any domestic entity which is formed or availed of 
for purposes of holding, directly or indirectly, specified foreign 
financial assets, in the same manner as if such entity were an 
individual.
    ``(g) Reasonable Cause Exception.--No penalty shall be imposed by 
this section on any failure which is shown to be due to reasonable cause 
and not due to willful neglect. The fact that a foreign jurisdiction 
would impose a civil or criminal penalty on the taxpayer (or any other 
person) for disclosing the required information is not reasonable cause.
    ``(h) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations 
or other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
purposes of this section, including regulations or other guidance which 
provide appropriate exceptions from the application of this section in 
the case of--
            ``(1) classes of assets identified by the Secretary,

III of subchapter A of chapter 61 is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to section 6038C the following new item:

        not provided by the taxpayer as required under the provisions of 
        those sections.
            ``(3) Increase in penalty for undisclosed foreign financial 
        asset understatements.--In the case of any portion of an 
        underpayment which is attributable to any undisclosed foreign 
        financial asset understatement, subsection (a) shall be applied 
        with respect to such portion by substituting `40 percent' for 
        `20 percent'.''.
