SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 21 USC 387 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:

[[Page 123 STAT. 1777]]

            (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is 
        a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results in 
        new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.
            (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical 
        communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous and 
        cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse health 
        effects.
            (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.
            (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under 
        the minimum legal age to purchase such products.
            (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute 
        significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products 
        by adolescents.
            (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and 
        marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb 
        tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the 
        sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.
            (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and 
        regulatory authority and resources they need to address 
        comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused 
        by the use of tobacco products.
            (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public 
        health community, and the public at large recognize that the 
        tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.
            (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the 
        Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating 
        interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.
            (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use 
        of tobacco products are activities in and substantially 
        affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, marketed, 
        advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce on a 
        nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the Nation's 
        economy.
            (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use 
        of such products substantially affect interstate commerce 
        through the health care and other costs attributable to the use 
        of tobacco products.
            (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact 
        legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with 
        the authority to regulate tobacco products and the advertising 
        and promotion of such products. The benefits to the American 
        people from enacting such legislation would be significant in 
        human and economic terms.
            (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of 
        premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in the 
        United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 Americans 
        have chronic illnesses related to smoking.
            (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent 
        would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from 
        becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of them 
        from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. Such a 
        reduction in youth smoking would also result in approximately 
        $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to reduced health care 
        costs.
            (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco 
        products have been especially directed to attract young persons 
        to use tobacco products, and these efforts have resulted in 
        increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to oversee

[[Page 123 STAT. 1778]]

        these activities have not been successful in adequately 
        preventing such increased use.
            (16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than 
        $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, 
        increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-term 
        attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.
            (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly portrays 
        the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and healthful to 
        minors.
            (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by 
        persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 are 
        regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.
            (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of 
        sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with 
        sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports 
        and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting 
        activity.
            (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable 
        tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about 
        tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to 
        overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the 
        number of young people who begin to use tobacco.
            (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and 
        other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and 
        encourages them to use tobacco products.
            (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco 
        market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including 
        tobacco use by young people.
            (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than 
        adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily 
        marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and older, 
        smoke these same brands.
            (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people 
        are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco 
        market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than 
        adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices 
        that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.
            (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a 
        positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.
            (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent 
        unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation 
        prohibiting access to young people and providing for education 
        about tobacco use.
            (27) International experience shows that advertising 
        regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a greater 
        impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use than weaker 
        or less comprehensive ones.
            (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a 
        ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while 
        preserving the informational function of advertising.
            (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt 
        legislation to address the public health crisis created by 
        actions of the tobacco industry.
            (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of 
        Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of the 
        Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion

[[Page 123 STAT. 1779]]

        as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are 
        consistent with the first amendment to the United States 
        Constitution and with the standards set forth in the amendments 
        made by this subtitle for the regulation of tobacco products by 
        the Food and Drug Administration, and the restriction on the 
        sale and distribution of, including access to and the 
        advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in such 
        regulations are substantially related to accomplishing the 
        public health goals of this division.
            (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will 
        directly and materially advance the Federal Government's 
        substantial interest in reducing the number of children and 
        adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in 
        preventing the life-threatening health consequences associated 
        with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of Americans who use 
        tobacco products begin using such products while they are minors 
        and become addicted to the nicotine in those products before 
        reaching the age of 18. Tobacco advertising and promotion play a 
        crucial role in the decision of these minors to begin using 
        tobacco products. Less restrictive and less comprehensive 
        approaches have not and will not be effective in reducing the 
        problems addressed by such regulations. The reasonable 
        restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco 
        products contained in such regulations will lead to a 
        significant decrease in the number of minors using and becoming 
        addicted to those products.
            (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no 
        more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco 
        manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the 
        number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and 
        smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health 
        consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations are 
        narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and promotional 
        practices which are most likely to be seen or heard by youth and 
        most likely to entice them into tobacco use, while affording 
        tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample opportunity to convey 
        information about their products to adult consumers.
            (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that 
        typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-term 
        or permanent abstinence.
            (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is 
        cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help them 
        quit completely.
            (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and 
        finance criminal activities both domestically and 
        internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been 
        linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.
            (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration 
        review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks or 
        exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be 
        empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such 
        products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to 
        marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such 
        products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will 
        benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into 
        account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not 
        currently use tobacco products.

[[Page 123 STAT. 1780]]

            (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the 
        risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such risks, 
        those products can cause substantial harm to the public health 
        to the extent that the individuals, who would otherwise not 
        consume tobacco products or would consume such products less, 
        use tobacco products purporting to reduce risk. Those who use 
        products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do 
        not in fact reduce risk, rather than quitting or reducing their 
        use of tobacco products, have a substantially increased 
        likelihood of suffering disability and premature death. The 
        costs to society of the widespread use of products sold or 
        distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce 
        risk or that increase risk include thousands of unnecessary 
        deaths and injuries and huge costs to our health care system.
            (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many 
        smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' 
        cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. As 
        the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken beliefs 
        about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' and 
        ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit smoking 
        entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.
            (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been no 
        reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low tar'' 
        and ``light'' cigarettes, and such products may actually 
        increase the risk of tobacco use.
            (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as modified 
        risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce risk are so 
        high that there is a compelling governmental interest in 
        ensuring that statements about modified risk tobacco products 
        are complete, accurate, and relate to the overall disease risk 
        of the product.
            (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers 
        have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is 
        claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in 
        the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to provide 
        clarification.
            (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated 
        statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether 
        express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would be 
        detrimental to the public health.
            (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health 
        from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco 
        products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to 
        require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or 
        distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of 
        marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to support 
        claims be fully verified.
            (44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory agency 
        with the scientific expertise to identify harmful substances in 
        products to which consumers are exposed, to design standards to 
        limit exposure to those substances, to evaluate scientific 
        studies supporting claims about the safety of products, and to 
        evaluate the impact of labels, labeling, and advertising on 
        consumer behavior in order to reduce the risk of harm and 
        promote understanding of the impact of the product on health. In 
        connection with its mandate to promote health and reduce the 
        risk of harm, the Food and Drug Administration

[[Page 123 STAT. 1781]]

        routinely makes decisions about whether and how products may be 
        marketed in the United States.
            (45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect 
        consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to 
        regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those 
        marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and 
        those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its 
        mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither 
        the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency except 
        the Food and Drug Administration possesses the scientific 
        expertise needed to implement effectively all provisions of the 
        Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.
            (46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications 
        directed to consumers through the media or through a label, 
        labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved or 
        inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies with 
        Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are likely to 
        be confused and misled. Depending upon the particular language 
        used and its context, such a statement could result in consumers 
        being misled into believing that the product is endorsed by the 
        Food and Drug Administration for use or in consumers being 
        misled about the harmfulness of the product because of such 
        regulation, inspection, approval, or compliance.
            (47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge 
        found that the major United States cigarette companies continue 
        to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., 
        et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).
            (48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge 
        found that the major United States cigarette companies 
        dramatically increased their advertising and promotional 
        spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking 
        subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement in 
        1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 
        99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).
            (49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge 
        found that the major United States cigarette companies have 
        designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine delivery 
        levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to create and 
        sustain addiction while also concealing much of their nicotine-
        related research. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil 
        Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).
SEC. 3. <<NOTE: 21 USC 387 note.>>  PURPOSE.

    The purposes of this division are--
            (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug Administration 
        to regulate tobacco products under the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by recognizing it as the 
        primary Federal regulatory authority with respect to the 
        manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products as 
        provided for in this division;
            (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the 
        authority to address issues of particular concern to public 
        health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young people 
        and dependence on tobacco;

[[Page 123 STAT. 1782]]

            (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set 
        national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco 
        products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of 
        ingredients used in such products;
            (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to 
        ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco 
        industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less 
        harmful tobacco products;
            (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the 
        authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other 
        harmful components of tobacco products;
            (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, 
        to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research 
        which has not previously been made available, as well as 
        research generated in the future, relating to the health and 
        dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;
            (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to 
        adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are not 
        sold or accessible to underage purchasers;
            (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the tobacco 
        industry;
            (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the 
        social costs associated with tobacco-related diseases; and
            (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in 
        tobacco products.

        promotion of, the tobacco product, if the Secretary determines 
        that such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of 
        the public health. The Secretary may by regulation impose 
        restrictions on the advertising and promotion of a tobacco 
        product consistent with and to full extent permitted by the 
        first amendment to the Constitution. The finding as to whether 
        such regulation would be appropriate for the protection of the 
        public health shall be determined with respect to the risks and 
        benefits to the population as a whole, including users and

                those who do not use tobacco products will start using 
                such products.

        a tobacco product be limited to the written or oral 
        authorization of a practitioner licensed by law to prescribe 
        medical products.

                      in a proposed rule, that it is appropriate for the 
                      protection of public health to require the 
                      reduction or elimination of an additive, 
                      constituent (including a smoke constituent), or 
                      other component of a tobacco product because the 
                      Secretary has found that the additive, 
                      constituent, or other component is or may be 
                      harmful, any party objecting to the proposed 
                      standard on the ground that the proposed standard 
                      will not reduce or eliminate the risk of illness 
                      or injury may provide for the Secretary's 
                      consideration scientific evidence that 
                      demonstrates that the proposed standard will not 
                      reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury.

        effects of the tobacco product standard on the health of 
        adolescent tobacco users, adult tobacco users, or nontobacco 
        users, such as the creation of a significant demand for 
        contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the 
        requirements of this chapter and the significance of such 
        demand.

    ``(c) Proposed Standards.--

        publication. Notice.>>  shall publish in the Federal Register a

        effect before 1 year after the date of its publication unless 
        the Secretary determines that an earlier effective date is 
        necessary for the protection of the public health. Such date or 
        dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent with 
        the public health, economic loss to, and disruption or 
        dislocation of, domestic and international trade. In 
        establishing such effective date or dates, the Secretary shall 
        consider information submitted in connection with a proposed

        compliance with the standard, and including information 
        concerning the existence of patents that make it impossible to 
        comply in the timeframe envisioned in the proposed standard. If 
        the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary's evaluation of 
        submitted comments, that a product standard can be met only by 
        manufacturers requiring substantial changes to the methods of 
        farming the domestically grown tobacco used by the manufacturer, 
        the
