                        Administrative Provision

    Sec. 1002. <<NOTE: 38 USC 107 note.>> Payments to Eligible Persons 
Who Served in the United States Armed Forces in the Far East During 
World War II.  (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Philippine islands became a United States possession 
        in 1898 when they were ceded from Spain following the Spanish-
        American War.
            (2) During World War II, Filipinos served in a variety of 
        units, some of which came under the direct control of the United 
        States Armed Forces.
            (3) The regular Philippine Scouts, the new Philippine 
        Scouts, the Guerrilla Services, and more than 100,000 members of 
        the Philippine Commonwealth Army were called into the service of 
        the United States Armed Forces of the Far East on July 26, 1941, 
        by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
            (4) Even after hostilities had ceased, wartime service of 
        the new Philippine Scouts continued as a matter of law until the 
        end of 1946, and the force gradually disbanded and was 
        disestablished in 1950.
            (5) Filipino veterans who were granted benefits prior to the 
        enactment of the so-called Rescissions Acts of 1946 (Public Laws 
        79-301 and 79-391) currently receive full benefits under laws 
        administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but under 
        section 107 of title 38, United States Code, the service of 
        certain other Filipino veterans is deemed not to be active 
        service for purposes of such laws.
            (6) These other Filipino veterans only receive certain 
        benefits under title 38, United States Code, and, depending on 
        where they legally reside, are paid such benefit amounts at 
        reduced rates.
            (7) The benefits such veterans receive include service-
        connected compensation benefits paid under chapter 11 of title 
        38, United States Code, dependency indemnity compensation 
        survivor benefits paid under chapter 13 of title 38, United 
        States Code, and burial benefits under chapters 23 and 24 of 
        title 38, United States Code, and such benefits are paid to 
        beneficiaries at the rate of $0.50 per dollar authorized, unless 
        they lawfully reside in the United States.
            (8) Dependents' educational assistance under chapter 35 of 
        title 38, United States Code, is also payable for the dependents 
        of such veterans at the rate of $0.50 per dollar authorized, 
        regardless of the veterans' residency.

    (b) Compensation Fund.--
            (1) In General.--There is in the general fund of the

            (2) Availability of Funds.--Subject to the availability of 
        appropriations for such purpose, amounts in the fund shall be

Required if Covered Entity Uses Electronic Health Record.--
            ``(1) In general.--In applying section 164.528 of title 45, 
        Code of Federal Regulations, in the case that a covered entity

        section 13101. Such regulations shall only require such 
        information to be collected through an electronic health record 
        in a manner that takes into account the interests of the 
        individuals in learning the circumstances under which their 
        protected health information is being disclosed and takes into 
        account the administrative burden of accounting for such 
        disclosures.

        for an accounting, a covered entity shall elect to provide

                information from inappropriate access, use, or 
                disclosure.
                    (D) The purpose of the exchange is the health care

                costs of the preparation and transmittal of the data for 
                such purpose, if the Secretary finds that such further 
                restriction will not impede such research or public 
                health activities.
            (4) Effective date.--Paragraph (1) shall apply to exchanges 
        occurring on or after the date that is 6 months after the date

        explanation) is in an electronic form shall not be greater than 
        the entity's labor costs in responding to the request for the 
        copy (or summary or explanation).

otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing, including 
a disclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties, to the 
Board, an inspector general, the Comptroller General, a member of 
Congress, a State or Federal regulatory or law enforcement agency, a 
person with supervisory authority over the employee (or such other 
person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate, 
discover, or terminate misconduct), a court or grand jury, the head of a 
Federal agency, or their representatives, information that the employee

        relating to covered funds;
            (2) a gross waste of covered funds;

                      determination that the complaint is frivolous,

                      Federal or State judicial or administrative 
                      proceeding has previously been invoked to resolve

                      a report within the 180-day period specified under 
                      subparagraph (A) and the person submitting the 
                      complaint agrees to an extension of time, the 
                      inspector general shall submit a report under 
                      paragraph (1) within such additional period of 
                      time as shall be agreed upon between the inspector 
                      general and the person submitting the complaint.
                          (ii) Extension granted by inspector general.--
                      If the inspector general is unable to complete an 
                      investigation under this section in time to submit 
                      a report within the 180-day period specified under

                      the period for not more than 180 days without 
                      agreeing with the person submitting the complaint 
                      to such extension, provided that the inspector 
                      general provides a written explanation (subject to 
                      the authority to exclude information under 
                      paragraph (4)(C)) for the decision, which shall be 
                      provided to both the person submitting the 
                      complaint and the non-Federal employer.
                          (iii) Semi-annual report on extensions.--The 
                      inspector general shall include in semi-annual 
                      reports to Congress a list of those investigations 
                      for which the inspector general received an

                explanation (subject to the authority to exclude 
                information under paragraph (4)(C)) for such decision.
                    (B) Assumption of rights to civil remedy.--Upon 
                receipt of an explanation of a decision not to conduct 
                or continue an investigation under subparagraph (A), the 
                person submitting a complaint shall immediately assume 
                the right to a civil remedy under subsection (c)(3) as 
                if the 210-day period specified under such subsection 
                has already passed.
                    (C) Semi-annual report.--The inspector general shall 
                include in semi-annual reports to Congress a list of 
                those investigations the inspector general decided not 
                to conduct or continue under this paragraph.
            (4) Access to investigative file of inspector general.--
                    (A) In general.--The person alleging a reprisal 
                under this section shall have access to the 
                investigation file of

[[Page 123 STAT. 299]]

                the appropriate inspector general in accordance with 
                section 552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
                referred to as the ``Privacy Act''). The investigation 
                of the inspector general shall be deemed closed for 
                purposes of disclosure under such section when an 
                employee files an appeal to an agency head or a court of 
                competent jurisdiction.
                    (B) Civil action.--In the event the person alleging 
                the reprisal brings suit under subsection (c)(3), the 
                person alleging the reprisal and the non-Federal 
                employer shall have access to the investigative file of 
                the inspector general in accordance with the Privacy 
                Act.
                    (C) Exception.--The inspector general may exclude 
                from disclosure--
                          (i) information protected from disclosure by a 
                      provision of law; and
                          (ii) any additional information the inspector 
                      general determines disclosure of which would 
                      impede a continuing investigation, provided that 
                      such information is disclosed once such disclosure 
                      would no longer impede such investigation, unless 
                      the inspector general determines that disclosure 
                      of law enforcement techniques, procedures, or 
                      information could reasonably be expected to risk 
                      circumvention of the law or disclose the identity 
                      of a confidential source.
            (5) Privacy of information.--An inspector general 
        investigating an alleged reprisal under this section may not 
        respond to any inquiry or disclose any information from or about 
        any person alleging such reprisal, except in accordance with the 
        provisions of section 552a of title 5, United States Code, or as 
        required by any other applicable Federal law.

    (c) Remedy and Enforcement Authority.--
            (1) Burden of proof.--
                    (A) Disclosure as contributing factor in reprisal.--
                          (i) In general.--A person alleging a reprisal 
                      under this section shall be deemed to have 
                      affirmatively established the occurrence of the 
                      reprisal if the person demonstrates that a 
                      disclosure described in subsection (a) was a 
                      contributing factor in the reprisal.
                          (ii) Use of circumstantial evidence.--A 
                      disclosure may be demonstrated as a contributing 
                      factor in a reprisal for purposes of this 
                      paragraph by circumstantial evidence, including--
                                    (I) evidence that the official 
                                undertaking the reprisal knew of the 
                                disclosure; or
                                    (II) evidence that the reprisal 
                                occurred within a period of time after 
                                the disclosure such that a reasonable 
                                person could conclude that the 
                                disclosure was a contributing factor in 
                                the reprisal.
                    (B) Opportunity for rebuttal.--The head of an agency 
                may not find the occurrence of a reprisal with respect 
                to a reprisal that is affirmatively established under 
                subparagraph (A) if the non-Federal employer 
                demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the 
                non-Federal employer would have taken the action 
                constituting the reprisal in the absence of the 
                disclosure.

[[Page 123 STAT. 300]]

            (2) Agency action.--
        Not <<NOTE: Deadline. Determination. Relief orders.>> later than 
        30 days after receiving an inspector general report under 
        subsection (b), the head of the agency concerned shall determine 
        whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the non-
        Federal employer has subjected the complainant to a reprisal 
        prohibited by subsection (a) and shall either issue an order 
        denying relief in whole or in part or shall take 1 or more of 
        the following actions:
                    (A) Order the employer to take affirmative action to 
                abate the reprisal.
                    (B) Order the employer to reinstate the person to 
                the position that the person held before the reprisal, 
                together with the compensation (including back pay), 
                compensatory damages, employment benefits, and other 
                terms and conditions of employment that would apply to 
                the person in that position if the reprisal had not been 
                taken.
                    (C) Order the employer to pay the complainant an 
                amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and 
                expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert 
                witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the 
                complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the 
                complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the 
                head of the agency or a court of competent jurisdiction.
            (3) Civil action.--If <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> the head of an 
        agency issues an order denying relief in whole or in part under 
        paragraph (1), has not issued an order within 210 days after the 
        submission of a complaint under subsection (b), or in the case 
        of an extension of time under subsection (b)(2)(B)(i), within 30 
        days after the expiration of the extension of time, or decides 
        under subsection (b)(3) not to investigate or to discontinue an 
        investigation, and there is no showing that such delay or 
        decision is due to the bad faith of the complainant, the 
        complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative 
        remedies with respect to the complaint, and the complainant may 
        bring a de novo action at law or equity against the employer to 
        seek compensatory damages and other relief available under this 
        section in the appropriate district court of the United States, 
        which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard 
        to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the 
        request of either party to the action, be tried by the court 
        with a jury.
            (4) Judicial enforcement of order.--Whenever a person fails 
        to comply with an order issued under paragraph (2), the head of 
        the agency shall file an action for enforcement of such order in 
        the United States district court for a district in which the 
        reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under 
        this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, 
        including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages,

                liability of the residents of such possession under such 
                system is determined by reference to the income tax laws

              PART VII--RULES RELATING TO OWNERSHIP CHANGES

SEC. 1261. <<NOTE: 26 USC 382 note.>>  CLARIFICATION OF REGULATIONS 
            RELATED TO LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN BUILT-IN LOSSES FOLLOWING 
            AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The delegation of authority to the Secretary of the 
        Treasury under section 382(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986 does not authorize the Secretary to provide exemptions or 
        special rules that are restricted to particular industries or 
        classes of taxpayers.

[[Page 123 STAT. 343]]

            (2) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 is inconsistent 
        with the congressional intent in enacting such section 382(m).
            (3) The legal authority to prescribe Internal Revenue 
        Service Notice 2008-83 is doubtful.
            (4) However, as taxpayers should generally be able to rely 
        on guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury legislation 
        is necessary to clarify the force and effect of Internal Revenue 
        Service Notice 2008-83 and restore the proper application under 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the limitation on built-in 
        losses following an ownership change of a bank.

    (b) Determination of Force and Effect of Internal Revenue Service 
Notice 2008-83 Exempting Banks From Limitation on Certain Built-in 
Losses Following Ownership Change.--
            (1) In general.--Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83--
                    (A) shall be deemed to have the force and effect of 
                law with respect to any ownership change (as defined in 
                section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) 
                occurring on or before January 16, 2009, and
                    (B) shall have no force or effect with respect to 
                any ownership change after such date.
            (2) Binding contracts.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), 
        Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-83 shall have the force and 
        effect of law with respect to any ownership change (as so 
        defined) which occurs after January 16, 2009, if such change--
                    (A) is pursuant to a written binding contract 
                entered into on or before such date, or
                    (B) is pursuant to a written agreement entered into 
                on or before such date and such agreement was described 
                on or before such date in a public announcement or in a 
                filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
                required by reason of such ownership change.

        manner and shall be subject to the same limitations (including 
        rent, income, and use restrictions on such building) as an 
        allocation of housing credit dollar amount allocated by such 
        State housing credit agency under section 42 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986, except that such subawards shall not be

        reasonable fees from a subaward recipient to cover expenses 
        associated with the performance of its duties under this 
        paragraph. The State housing credit agency may retain an agent

        paragraph.

        conditions or restrictions, including a requirement providing 
        for recapture, on any subaward under this section so as to 
        assure that the building with respect to which such subaward is 
        made remains a qualified low-income building during the 
        compliance period. Any such recapture shall be payable to the 
        Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the 
        Treasury and may be enforced by means

    ``(f)(1)(A) In addition to any other amounts, the Secretary of Labor 
shall provide for the making of unemployment compensation modernization 
incentive payments (hereinafter `incentive payments') to the accounts of 
the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund, by transfer from amounts 
reserved for that purpose in the Federal unemployment account, in 
accordance with succeeding provisions of this subsection.
    ``(B) The maximum incentive payment allowable under this subsection 
with respect to any State shall, as determined by the Secretary of 
Labor, be equal to the amount obtained by multiplying $7,000,000,000 by 
the same ratio as would apply under subsection (a)(2)(B) for purposes of 
determining such State's share of any excess amount (as described in 
subsection (a)(1)) that would have been subject to transfer to State 
accounts, as of October 1, 2008, under the provisions of subsection (a).
    ``(C) Of the maximum incentive payment determined under subparagraph 
(B) with respect to a State--
            ``(i) one-third shall be transferred to the account of such 
        State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the State 
        law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (2); and

        such State upon a certification under paragraph (4)(B) that the 
        State law of such State meets the requirements of paragraph (3).

paragraph if such State law--
            ``(A) uses a base period that includes the most recently 
        completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year 
        for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment 
        compensation; or

        not otherwise be eligible for unemployment compensation under 
        the State law because of the use of a base period that does not 
        include the most recently completed calendar quarter before the 
        start of the benefit year, eligibility shall be determined using 
        a base period that includes such calendar quarter.

    ``(3) The State law of a State meets the requirements of this 
paragraph if such State law includes provisions to carry out at least 2 
of the following subparagraphs:
            ``(A) An individual shall not be denied regular unemployment 
        compensation under any State law provisions relating to 
        availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to 
        accept work, solely because such individual is seeking only 
        part-time work (as defined by the Secretary of Labor), except 
        that the State law provisions carrying out this subparagraph may 
        exclude an individual if a majority of the weeks of work in such 
        individual's base period do not include part-time work (as so 
        defined).

        unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that 
        separation is for any compelling family reason. For purposes of 
        this subparagraph, the term `compelling family reason' means the 
        following:

                believe that such individual's continued employment 
                would jeopardize the safety of the individual or of any

        a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the 
        individual's place of employment, for entry into a high-demand 
        occupation.

        under this subparagraph to an individual for a week of 
        unemployment shall be equal to--

                State law.

        subparagraph to any individual shall be equal to at least 26 
        times the individual's average weekly benefit amount (including 
        dependents' allowances) for the most recent benefit year.

        any individual who is entitled to receive regular unemployment 
        compensation and who has any dependents (as defined by State 
        law), in an amount equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, 
        subject to any aggregate limitation on such allowances which the 
        State law may establish (but which aggregate limitation on the 
        total allowance for dependents paid to an individual may not be 
        less than $50 for each week of unemployment or 50 percent of the 
        individual's weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, 
        whichever is less), except that a State law may provide for a 
        reasonable reduction in the amount of any such allowance for a 
        week of less than total unemployment.

                      that is different than coverage under the plan in 
                      which such individual was enrolled at the time the 
                      qualifying event occurred, and such coverage shall

                      purposes of the applicable COBRA continuation 
                      coverage provision.

                      individual may elect to enroll in different 
                      coverage as described in clause (i) only if--

                                determination that such employer will 
                                permit assistance eligible individuals 
                                to enroll in different coverage as

                                coverage does not exceed the premium for 
                                coverage in which the individual was 
                                enrolled at the time the qualifying

                                which the individual elects to enroll is 
                                coverage that is also offered to the 
                                active employees of the employer at the

        professionals and mechanisms for delivering incentives and 
        adjustments to those professionals, including through incentive 
        payments and adjustments through Medicare Advantage 
        organizations or intermediary organizations.

subsection (d) hospital from the application of subclause (I) with 
respect to a fiscal year if the Secretary determines, subject to annual 
renewal, that requiring such hospital to be a meaningful EHR user during 
such fiscal year would result in a significant hardship, such as in the 
case of a hospital in a rural area without sufficient Internet access. 
In no case may a hospital be granted an exemption under this subclause 
for more than 5 years.
    ``(III) For fiscal year 2015 and each subsequent fiscal year, a 
State in which hospitals are paid for services under section 1814(b)(3)

manner that is designed to result in an aggregate reduction in payments 
to hospitals in the State that is equivalent to the aggregate reduction 
that would have occurred if payments had been reduced to each subsection 
(d) hospital in the State in a manner comparable to the reduction under 
the previous provisions of this clause. <<NOTE: Reports.>> The State 
shall report to the Secretary the methodology it will use to make the 
payment adjustment under the previous sentence.

specified by the Secretary.''.

                          (iv) the extent to which such health care

                      under this Act, under title XIII of division A, 
                      under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security

                      to the needs of, and be applied to, various 
                      populations (including children and disabled 
                      individuals); and
                          (iv) the capacity of such systems to 
                      facilitate interoperability.
                    (B) Considerations.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Health and Human

                smaller health care providers, health care providers 
                located in rural or other medically underserved areas, 
                and safety net providers that deliver a significant 
                level of health care to uninsured individuals, Medicaid 
                beneficiaries, SCHIP beneficiaries, and other vulnerable 
                individuals.

An eligible professional shall not qualify as a Medicaid provider under 
this subsection unless any right to payment under sections 1848(o) and

uncompensated care, the Secretary may require the adjustment of such 
uncompensated care data so that it would be an appropriate proxy for 
charity care, including a downward adjustment to eliminate bad debt data 
from uncompensated care. In applying subparagraphs 
(A) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> and (B)(ii), the methodology established by 
the Secretary for patient volume shall include individuals enrolled in a 
Medicaid managed care plan (under section 1903(m) or section 1932).

include, to the extent practicable, a data matching process between 
State Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services

may require the submission of such data relating to payments to such 
Medicaid providers as the Secretary may specify.

shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid duplicative 
requirements from Federal and State governments to demonstrate 
meaningful use of certified EHR technology under this title and title 
XVIII. In doing so, the Secretary may deem satisfaction of requirements 
for such meaningful use for a payment year under title XVIII to be 
sufficient to qualify as meaningful use under this subsection. The 
Secretary may also specify the reporting periods under this subsection 
in order to carry out this paragraph.

        certified EHR technology to promote health care quality and the 
        exchange of health care information under this title, subject to 
        applicable laws and regulations governing such exchange.

reports to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on status, 
progress, and oversight of payments described in paragraph (1),

also describe the extent of adoption of certified EHR technology among 
Medicaid providers resulting from the provisions of this subsection and 
any improvements in health outcomes, clinical quality, or efficiency 
resulting from such adoption.''.

available, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, 
there are appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account, 
$40,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2015 and $20,000,000

                relief for each subsequent calendar quarter ending 
                before July 1, 2010.
            (3) Applicable percent.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
                subject to subparagraph (B), the applicable percent is--
                          (i) 5.5 percent, if the State satisfies the

                      applied to a State under subparagraph (A) for any 
                      calendar quarter in the recession adjustment 
                      period beginning on or after January 1, 2009, and 
                      ending before July 1, 2010, (determined without 
                      regard to this subparagraph) is less than the 
                      percent applied for the preceding quarter (as so 
                      determined), the higher applicable percent shall 
                      continue in effect for each subsequent calendar 
                      quarter ending before July 1, 2010.

            (4) Computation of state unemployment increase percentage.--
                    (A) In general.--In this subsection, the ``State 
                unemployment increase percentage'' for a State for a 
                calendar quarter is equal to the number of percentage 
                points (if any) by which--
                          (i) the average monthly unemployment rate for 
                      the State for months in the most recent previous 
                      3-consecutive-month period for which data are 
                      available, subject to subparagraph (C); exceeds
                          (ii) the lowest average monthly unemployment 
                      rate for the State for any 3-consecutive-month 
                      period preceding the period described in clause 
                      (i) and beginning on or after January 1, 2006.
                    (B) Average monthly unemployment rate defined.--In 
                this paragraph, the term ``average monthly unemployment 
                rate'' means the average of the monthly number 
                unemployed, divided by the average of the monthly 
                civilian labor force, seasonally adjusted, as determined 
                based on the most recent monthly publications of the 
                Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.
                    (C) Special rule.--With respect to--
                          (i) the first 2 calendar quarters of the 
                      recession adjustment period, the most recent 
                      previous 3-consecutive-month period described in 
                      subparagraph (A)(i)

[[Page 123 STAT. 499]]

                      shall be the 3-consecutive-month period beginning 
                      with October 2008; and
                          (ii) the last 2 calendar quarters of the 
                      recession adjustment period, the most recent 
                      previous 3-consecutive-month period described in 
                      such subparagraph shall be the 3-consecutive-month 
                      period beginning with December 2009, or, if it 
                      results in a higher applicable percent under 
                      paragraph (3), the 3-consecutive-month period 
                      beginning with January 2010.

    (d) Increase in Cap on Medicaid Payments to Territories.--Subject to 
subsections (f) and (g), with respect to entire fiscal years occurring 
during the recession adjustment period and with respect to fiscal years 
only a portion of which occurs during such period (and in proportion to 
the portion of the fiscal year that occurs during such period), the 
amounts otherwise determined for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa under subsections (f) 
and (g) of section 1108 of the Social Security Act (42 6 U.S.C. 1308) 
shall each be increased by 30 percent (or, in the case of an election 
under subsection (b)(2), 15 percent). <<NOTE: Applicability.>> In the 
case of such an election by a territory, subsection (a)(1) of such 
section shall be applied without regard to any increase in payment made 
to the territory under part E of title IV of such Act that is 
attributable to the increase in FMAP effected under subsection (b) for 
the territory.

    (e) Scope of Application.--The increases in the FMAP for a State 
under this section shall apply for purposes of title XIX of the Social 
Security Act and shall not apply with respect to--
            (1) disproportionate share hospital payments described in 
        section 1923 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4);
            (2) payments under title IV of such Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et

        shall apply to payments under part E of title IV of such Act (42 
        U.S.C. 670 et seq.) and, for purposes of the application of this 
        section to the District of Columbia, payments under such part 
        shall be deemed to be made on the basis of the FMAP applied with 
        respect to such District for purposes of title XIX and as 
        increased under subsection (b));
            (3) payments under title XXI of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa

        on the enhanced FMAP described in section 2105(b) of such Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(b)); or
            (5) any payments under title XIX of such Act that are 
        attributable to expenditures for medical assistance provided to 
        individuals made eligible under a State plan under title XIX of 
        the Social Security Act (including under any waiver under such 
        title or under section 1115 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1315)) 
        because of income standards (expressed as a percentage of the 
        poverty line) for eligibility for medical assistance that are 
        higher than the income standards (as so expressed) for such 
        eligibility as in effect on July 1, 2008, (including as such 
        standards were proposed to be in effect under a State law 
        enacted but not effective as of such date or a State plan 
        amendment or waiver request under title XIX of such Act that was 
        pending approval on such date).

                under subsection (a), (b), or (c), or an increase in a 
                cap amount under subsection (d), if eligibility 
                standards, methodologies, or procedures under its State 
                plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act 
                (including any waiver under such title or under section 
                1115 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1315)) are more restrictive 
                than the eligibility standards, methodologies, or 
                procedures, respectively, under such plan (or waiver) as 
                in effect on July 1, 2008.

                Subject to subparagraph (C), a State that has restricted 
                eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures 
                under its State plan under title XIX of the Social 
                Security Act (including any waiver under such title or 
                under section 1115 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1315)) after 
                July 1, 2008, is no longer ineligible under subparagraph 
                (A) beginning with the first calendar quarter in which 
                the State has reinstated eligibility standards, 
                methodologies, or procedures that are no more 
                restrictive than the eligibility standards, 
                methodologies, or procedures, respectively, under such 
                plan (or waiver) as in effect on July 1, 2008.
                    (C) Special rules.--A State shall not be ineligible 
                under subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) for the calendar quarters before July 1, 
                      2009, on the basis of a restriction that was 
                      applied after July 1, 2008, and before the date of 
                      the enactment of this Act, if the State prior to

                      standards, methodologies, or procedures that are 
                      no more restrictive than the eligibility 
                      standards, methodologies, or procedures, 
                      respectively, under such plan (or waiver) as in 
                      effect on July 1, 2008; or
                          (ii) on the basis of a restriction that was 
                      directed to be made under State law as in effect 
                      on July 1, 2008, and would have been in effect as 
                      of such date, but for a delay in the effective 
                      date of a waiver under section 1115 of such Act 
                      with respect to such restriction.

                      section 1902(a)(37)(A) of the Social Security Act

                      claims in accordance with such section as applied 
                      under title XIX of such Act.
                          (ii) Reporting requirement.--Each State shall 
                      report to the Secretary, on a quarterly basis, its 
                      compliance with the requirements of clause (i) as

                      reporting requirement imposed under clause (ii), 
                      during any period in which there are exigent 
                      circumstances, including natural disasters, that 
                      prevent the timely processing of claims or the

                          (iv) Application to claims.--Clauses (i) and

    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
study the period of national economic downturn in effect on the date of 
enactment of this Act, as well as previous periods of national economic 
downturn since 1974, for the purpose of developing recommendations for

effects of temporary increases in the Federal medical assistance 
percentage under the Medicaid program with respect to such periods.
    (b) Report.--Not later than April 1, 2011, the Comptroller General 
of the United States shall submit a report to the appropriate committees 
of Congress on the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). 
Such report shall include the following:

        determines appropriate for modifying the national economic 
        downturn assistance formula for temporary adjustment of the

        Federal medical assistance percentage under Medicaid (also 
        referred to as a ``countercyclical FMAP'') described in GAO 
        report number GAO-07-97 to improve the effectiveness of the

                percentage could be adjusted to address State and 
                regional economic variations during such periods; and
                    (C) how the determination of the amount of such 
                percentage could be adjusted to be more responsive to 
                actual Medicaid costs incurred by States during such 
                periods.
            (2) An analysis of the impact on States during such periods 
        of--
                    (A) declines in private health benefits coverage;
                    (B) declines in State revenues; and

                publicly-funded programs to provide health benefits 
                coverage for State residents.
            (3) Identification of, and recommendations for addressing,
