To extend the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, to provide customs 
   support services to Haiti, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: May 24, 
                         2010 -  [H.R. 5160]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Haiti Economic 
Lift Program Act of 2010.>> 
SECTION <<NOTE: 19 USC 2701 note.>> 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of 
2010''.
SEC. <<NOTE: 19 USC 2703a note.>> 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude 
        earthquake, the worst earthquake to affect Haiti in recorded 
        history. Aftershocks from the earthquake, measuring up to 6.0 on 
        the Richter scale, continued for days afterwards.
            (2) The earthquake has devastated Haiti's infrastructure, 
        including homes, offices, factories, roads, ports, 
        communications, and other facilities. The loss of life 
        attributable to the earthquake was massive.
            (3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest 
        country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 
        countries according to the United Nation's Human Development 
        Index.
            (4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of 
        Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic 
        growth and development, including making strides towards 
        establishing a competitive apparel sector.
            (5) United States trade preference programs, including the 
        Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (as amended by the United 
        States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, the Haitian 
        Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 
        2006, and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through 
        Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008), which extend duty-free 
        tariff treatment to certain apparel produced in Haiti, have made 
        an important contribution to Haiti's economic development 
        efforts.
            (6) However, the Haitian apparel sector has been hard hit by 
        the January 12, 2010, earthquake. A number of apparel factories 
        based in and around Port-au-Prince have been heavily damaged, 
        including the collapse of one major apparel factory that had 
        employed nearly 4,000 workers.
            (7) The Port-au-Prince seaport that had served the apparel 
        trade has been badly damaged. And extensive damage to roads

[[Page 124 STAT. 1195]]

        has made it difficult to transport apparel to the Dominican 
        Republic for shipment from ports in that country.
            (8) According to estimates by the Department of Commerce, 
        imports of apparel articles from Haiti to the United States in 
        2010 have decreased by 43 percent as compared to the same period 
        in 2009.
            (9) The earthquake has increased significantly the costs and 
        uncertainty of doing business in Haiti. A strong and unequivocal 
        commitment from the United States is needed to help Haiti offset 
        these costs and preserve the gains made under United States 
        trade preference programs, and to encourage buyers and investors 
        to stand with Haiti through this crisis.
SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF CARIBBEAN BASIN ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT.

    The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)
