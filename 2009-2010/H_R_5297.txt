        Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)) is reviewed under paragraph (1) not 
        less frequently than once every 5 years.

    (b) Rules.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator shall promulgate rules for conducting the 
reviews required under subsection (a).
SEC. 1345. STUDY AND REPORT ON THE MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study of the mentor-protege program of the Administration for 
small business concerns participating in programs under section 8(a) of 
the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), and other relationships and 
strategic alliances pairing a larger business and a small business 
concern partner to gain access to Federal Government contracts, to 
determine whether the programs and relationships are effectively 
supporting the goal of increasing the participation of small business 
concerns in Government contracting.
    (b) Matters To Be Studied.--The study conducted under this section 
shall include--
            (1) a review of a broad cross-section of industries; and
            (2) an evaluation of--
                    (A) how each Federal agency carrying out a program 
                described in subsection (a) administers and monitors the 
                program;
                    (B) whether there are systems in place to ensure 
                that the mentor-protege relationship, or similar 
                affiliation, promotes real gain to the protege, and is 
                not just a mechanism to enable participants that would 
                not otherwise qualify under section 8(a) of the Small 
                Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) to receive contracts 
                under that section; and
                    (C) the degree to which protege businesses become 
                able to compete for Federal contracts without the 
                assistance of a mentor.

    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the 
Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives a report on 
the results of the study conducted under this section.

[[Page 124 STAT. 2578]]

    (c) Eligibility Criteria for State Other Credit Support Programs.--
For a State other credit support program to be approved under this 
section, that program shall be required to be a program of the State 
that--
            (1) can demonstrate that, at a minimum, $1 of public 
        investment by the State program will cause and result in $1 of 
        new private credit;
            (2) can demonstrate a reasonable expectation that, when 
        considered with all other State programs of the State, such 
        State programs together have the ability to use amounts of new 
        Federal contributions to, or for the account of, all such 
        programs in the State to cause and result in amounts of new 
        small business lending at least 10 times the new Federal 
        contribution amount;
            (3) for those State other credit support programs that 
        provide their credit support through 1 or more financial 
        institution lenders, requires the financial institution lenders 
        to have a meaningful amount of their own capital resources at 
        risk in their small business lending; and
            (4) uses Federal funds allocated under this title to extend 
        credit support that--
                    (A) targets an average borrower size of 500 
                employees or less;
                    (B) does not extend credit support to borrowers that 
                have more than 750 employees;
                    (C) targets support towards loans with an average 
                principal amount of $5,000,000 or less; and
                    (D) does not extend credit support to loans that 
                exceed a principal amount of $20,000,000.

    (d) Additional Considerations.--In making a determination that a 
State other credit support program is eligible for Federal contributions 
to, or for the account of, the State program, the Secretary shall take 
into account the following additional considerations:
            (1) The anticipated benefits to the State, its businesses, 
        and its residents to be derived from the Federal contributions 
        to, or for the account of, the approved State other credit 
        support program, including the extent to which resulting small 
        business lending will expand economic opportunities.
            (2) The operational capacity, skills, and experience of the 
        management team of the State other credit support program.
            (3) The capacity of the State other credit support program 
        to manage increases in the volume of its small business lending.
            (4) The internal accounting and administrative controls 
        systems of the State other credit support program, and the 
        extent to which they can provide reasonable assurance that funds 
        of the State program are safeguarded against waste, loss, 
        unauthorized use, or misappropriation.
            (5) The soundness of the program design and implementation 
        plan of the State other credit support program.

    (e) Federal Contributions to Approved State Other Credit Support 
Programs.--A State other credit support program approved under this 
section will be eligible for receiving Federal contributions to, or for 
the account of, the State program in an amount consistent with the 
schedule describing the apportionment of allocated Federal funds among 
State programs delivered by the State to the Secretary under the 
allocation agreement.

        requirements for approved State other credit support programs,

        Secretary determines applicable and appropriate, the minimum 
        Program requirements for approved State capital access programs 
        in section 3005(e).

                operating goals will allow it to address the needs of 
                small businesses in the areas it serves, as well as a

                institution to receive a capital investment based on the

                reduction shall not apply to a dollar amount of the 
                investment made by Treasury that is greater than the 
                dollar amount increase in the amount of small business 
                lending realized under this 
                program. <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  The Secretary may

                interest rate on the financial instrument to be issued 
                to the Secretary, from the dividend or interest rate 
                that would apply under subparagraphs (A) through (F), to 
                take into account any differential tax treatment of

                                such 10-year period, be subject to such

                      described under clause (i) shall not apply if the 
                      application of that term and condition would 
                      adversely affect the capital treatment of the 
                      stock or financial instrument under current or 
                      successor applicable capital provisions compared 
                      to a capital instrument with identical terms other 
                      than the term and condition described under clause 
                      (i).

increased regulatory uncertainty at community banks.

                efficiently utilize investigative resources;
            (4) capture outcome information on adjudicated claims for 
        reimbursement to allow for refinement and enhancement of the

        eventual status of a claim; and
            (5) prevent the payment of claims for reimbursement that
