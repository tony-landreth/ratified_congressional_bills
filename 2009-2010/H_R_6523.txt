SEC. 112. REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN NAVY AIRBORNE SIGNALS 
                        INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND 
                        RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Navy terminated the EP-X program to acquire a new 
        land-based airborne signals intelligence capability because of 
        escalating costs and funds budgeted for the program were re-
        allocated to other priorities.
            (2) The Navy took this action without planning and budgeting 
        for alternative means to meet operational requirements for 
        tactical-level and theater-level signals intelligence 
        capabilities to support the combatant commands and national 
        intelligence consumers.
            (3) The principal Navy airborne signals intelligence 
        capability today is the EP-3E Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated 
        Electronic System II (ARIES II)--the aircraft and associated 
        electronic equipment of this system are aging and will require

[[Page 124 STAT. 4153]]

        replacement or substantial ongoing upgrades to continue to meet 
        requirements.
            (4) The Special Projects Aircraft (SPA) platform of the Navy 
        is the second critical element in the airborne signals 
        intelligence capability of the Navy and provides the Navy its 
        most advanced, comprehensive multi-intelligence and quick-
        reaction capability available.

    (b) Requirement To Maintain Capabilities.--
            (1) Prohibition on retirement of platforms.--The Secretary 
        of the Navy may not retire (or to prepare to retire) the EP-3E 
        Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic System II or 
        Special Projects Aircraft platform.
            (2) Maintenance of platforms.--The Secretary of the Navy 
        shall continue to maintain, sustain, and upgrade the EP-3E 
        Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic System II and 
        Special Projects Aircraft platforms in order to provide 
        capabilities necessary to operate effectively against rapidly 
        evolving threats and to meet combatant commander operational 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance requirements.
            (3) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Certification.--Not later than 
        February 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the Under Secretary 
        of Defense for Intelligence and the Vice Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff shall jointly certify to Congress the following:
                    (A) The Secretary of the Navy is maintaining and 
                sustaining the EP-3E Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated 
                Electronic System II and Special Projects Aircraft 
                platform in a manner that meets the intelligence, 
                surveillance, and reconnaissance requirements of the 
                commanders of the combatant commands.
                    (B) Any plan for the retirement or replacement of 
                the EP-3E Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic 
                System II or Special Projects Aircraft platform will 
                provide, in the aggregate, an equivalent or superior 
                capability and capacity to the platform concerned.
            (4) Termination.--The requirements of this subsection with 
        respect to the EP-3E Airborne Reconnaissance Integrated 
        Electronic System II or the Special Projects Aircraft platform 
        shall expire on the commencement of the fielding by the Navy of 
        a platform or mix of platforms and sensors that are, in the 
        aggregate, equivalent or superior to the EP-3E Airborne 
        Reconnaissance Integrated Electronic System II (spiral 3) or the 
        Special Projects Aircraft (P909) platform.

    (c) Restriction on Transfer of Saber Focus Program ISR 
Capabilities.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Time period. Certification.>>  Restriction.--The 
        Secretary of the Navy may not transfer the Saber Focus unmanned 
        aerial system, associated equipment, or processing, 
        exploitation, and dissemination capabilities of the Saber Focus 
        program to the Secretary of the Air Force until 30 days after 
        the Secretary of the Air Force certifies to the congressional 
        defense committees that after such a transfer, the Secretary of 
        the Air Force will provide intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance (hereinafter in this section referred to as 
        ``ISR'') capabilities at the same or greater capability and 
        capacity level as the capability or capacity level at which the 
        Saber Focus program provides such capabilities to the area of 
        operations concerned as of the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.

[[Page 124 STAT. 4154]]

            (2) Continued navy provision of capabilities.--The Secretary 
        of the Navy shall continue to provide Saber Focus ISR program 
        capabilities at the same or greater capability and capacity 
        level as the capability or capacity level at which the Saber 
        Focus program provides such capabilities as of the date of the 
        enactment of this Act to the area of operations concerned 
        until--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Certification.>>  the certification 
                referred to in paragraph (1) is provided to the 
                congressional defense committees; or
                    (B) <<NOTE: Time period. Certification.>>  30 days 
                after the Secretary of Defense certifies to the 
                congressional defense committees that the ISR 
                capabilities of the Saber Focus program are no longer 
                required to mitigate the ISR requirements of the 
                combatant commander in the area of operations concerned.

Secretary shall--
            (1) conduct a cost-benefit analysis, in accordance with 
        Office of Management and Budget Circular A-94, comparing 
        extending the service life of existing F/A-18 aircraft with 
        procuring additional F/A-18E or F/A-18F aircraft as a means of 
        managing the shortfall of the Department of the Navy in strike 
        fighter aircraft; and
            (2) submit to the congressional defense committees a report 
        on such cost-benefit analysis.

    (b) Elements of Cost-benefit Analysis.--The cost-benefit analysis 
required by subsection (a)(1) shall include the following:
            (1) An estimate of the full costs, over the period covered 
        by the future-years defense program submitted to Congress under 
        section 221 of title 10, United States Code, with the budget of 
        the President, of extending legacy F/A-18 aircraft beyond 8,600 
        hours, including--
                    (A) any increases in operation and maintenance costs 
                associated with operating such aircraft beyond a service 
                life of 8,600 hours; and
                    (B) the costs with respect to the airframe,

                  Subtitle C--Missile Defense Programs

SEC. 221. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that the phased, adaptive approach to missile defense in 
        Europe is an appropriate response to the existing ballistic 
        missile threat from Iran to the European territory of North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, and to potential future 
        ballistic missile capabilities of Iran;
            (2) that the phased, adaptive approach to missile defense in 
        Europe is not intended to, and will not, provide a missile 
        defense capability relative to the ballistic missile deterrent 
        forces of the Russian Federation, or diminish strategic 
        stability with the Russian Federation;
            (3) to support the efforts of the United States Government 
        and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation 
        with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense 
        relative to Iranian missile threats;
            (4) that the ground-based midcourse defense system deployed 
        in Alaska and California currently provides adequate defensive 
        capability for the United States against currently anticipated 
        future long-range ballistic missile threats from Iran, and this 
        capability will be enhanced as the system is improved, including 
        by the planned deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in southern 
        Europe in 2011;
            (5) that the ground-based midcourse defense system should be 
        maintained, enhanced, and adequately tested to ensure its 
        operational capability through its service life;
            (6) that the United States should, as stated in its 
        unilateral statement accompanying the New START Treaty, 
        ``continue improving and deploying its missile defense systems 
        in order to defend itself against limited attack and as part of 
        our collaborative approach to strengthening stability in key 
        regions'';
            (7) that, as part of this effort, the Department of Defense 
        should pursue the development, testing, and deployment of 
        operationally effective versions of all variants of the standard 
        missile-3 for all four phases of the phased, adaptive approach 
        to missile defense in Europe;
            (8) that the standard missile-3 block IIB interceptor 
        missile planned for deployment in phase 4 of the phased, 
        adaptive approach should be capable of addressing the potential 
        future threat of intermediate-range and long-range ballistic 
        missiles

[[Page 124 STAT. 4168]]

        from Iran, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that 
        could be capable of reaching the United States;
            (9) that there are no constraints contained in the New START 
        Treaty on the development or deployment by the United States of 
        effective missile defenses, including all phases of the phased, 
        adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe and further 
        enhancements to the ground-based midcourse defense system, as 
        well as future missile defenses; and
            (10) that the Department of Defense should continue the 
        development, testing, and assessment of the two-stage ground-
        based interceptor in such a manner as to provide a hedge against 
        potential technical challenges with the development of the 
        standard missile-3 block IIB interceptor missile as a means of 
        augmenting the defense of Europe and of the homeland against a 
        limited ballistic missile attack from nations such as North 
        Korea or Iran.

    (b) New START Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``New START 
Treaty'' means the Treaty between the United States of America and the 
Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation 
of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010.

                        Subtitle E--Other Matters

SEC. 241. SENSE OF CONGRESS AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF DEPARTMENT 
                        OF DEFENSE PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT OF 
                        NEXT GENERATION SEMICONDUCTOR 
                        TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The next generation of weapons systems, battlefield 
        sensors, and intelligence platforms will need to be lighter, 
        more agile, consume less power, and have greater computational 
        power, which can be achieved by decreasing the feature size of 
        integrated circuits to the nanometer scale.

[[Page 124 STAT. 4176]]

            (2) There is a growing concern in the Department of Defense 
        and the United States intelligence community over the offshore 
        shift in development and production of high capacity 
        semiconductors. Greater reliance on providers of semiconductors 
        in the United States high technology industry would help 
        mitigate the security risks of such an offshore shift.
            (3) The development of new manufacturing technologies is 
        recognized in the semiconductor industry as critical to the 
        development of the next generation of integrated circuits.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should pursue research and development 
        capabilities to take the lead in developing and producing the 
        next generation of integrated circuits; and
            (2) the Department of Defense should continue to work with 
        industry and academia in pursuing the research and development 
        of advanced manufacturing techniques in support of the 
        development of the next generation of integrated circuits needed 
        for the requirements and specialized applications of the 
        Department of Defense.

        contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
            (2) Multiple studies have been conducted, and are being 
        conducted, which require significant amounts of data and 
        historical documentation, requiring the Department of the Navy 
        and ATSDR to have close collaboration and open access to 
        information.
            (3) In June 2010, the Department of the Navy and ATSDR 
        established the Camp Lejeune Data Mining Technical Workgroup to 
        identify and inventory information and data relevant to the 
        ongoing scientific research.

    (b) Requirements.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  ATSDR access to data.--By not later 
        than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary of the Navy shall ensure that the inventory created by 
        the Camp Lejeune Data Mining Technical Workgroup is accurate and

SEC. 314. COMPTROLLER GENERAL ASSESSMENT ON MILITARY ENVIRONMENTAL 
                        EXPOSURES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There have been various reports of the exposure of 
        current and former members of the Armed Forces, their 
        dependents, and civilian employees to environmental hazards 
        while living and working on military installations.
            (2) There is the need to better understand existing 
        Department of Defense policies and procedures for addressing 
        possible environmental exposures at military installations, 
        determining any correlation between such an exposure and a 
        subsequent health condition, and handling claims and potential 
        compensation.

[[Page 124 STAT. 4182]]

            (3) While many of these possible exposures have been studied 
        and evaluated, the extent to which those exposures caused or 
        contributed to the short- and long-term health conditions of 
        current and former members of the Armed Forces, their 
        dependents, and civilian employees remains largely unknown.
            (4) As for these possible exposures and the link between the 
        exposure and subsequent health conditions, there may be better 
        ways for the Federal Government to evaluate, address and, as 
        warranted, provide health benefits or possible compensation as a 
        remedy to these potential exposures.

    (b) Comptroller General Assessment Required.--The Comptroller 
General of the United States shall carry out an assessment of possible 
exposures to environmental hazards on military installations that 
includes the following:
            (1) An identification of the policies and processes by which 
        the Department of Defense and the military departments respond 
        to environmental hazards on military installations and possible 
        exposures and determine if there is a standard framework.
            (2) An identification of the existing processes available to 
        current and former members of the Armed Forces, their

after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
shall issue comprehensive guidance on the management of manufacturing 
risk in major defense acquisition programs.

    (b) Elements.--The guidance issued under subsection (a) shall, at a 
minimum--
            (1) require the use of manufacturing readiness levels as a 
        basis for measuring, assessing, reporting, and communicating 
        manufacturing readiness and risk on major defense acquisition 
        programs throughout the Department of Defense;
            (2) provide guidance on the definition of manufacturing 
        readiness levels and how manufacturing readiness levels should 
        be used to assess manufacturing risk and readiness in major 
        defense acquisition programs;
            (3) specify manufacturing readiness levels that should be 
        achieved at key milestones and decision points for major defense 
        acquisition programs;
            (4) identify tools and models that may be used to assess, 
        manage, and reduce risks that are identified in the course of 
        manufacturing readiness assessments for major defense 
        acquisition programs; and
            (5) require appropriate consideration of the manufacturing 
        readiness and manufacturing readiness processes of potential 
        contractors and subcontractors as a part of the source selection 
        process for major defense acquisition programs.

                the United States textile industry that use fire 
                resistant rayon fiber, and the extent to which that 
                instability or inefficiency results in less efficient 
                business practices, impedes investment and innovation, 
                and thereby results or may result in higher costs, 
                delayed delivery, or a lower quality of product 
                delivered to the Government.
                    (H) The extent to which any modifications to

SEC. 843. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN FOR CRITICAL RARE EARTH MATERIALS IN 
                        DEFENSE APPLICATIONS.

    (a) Assessment Required.--

[[Page 124 STAT. 4283]]

            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall undertake an 
        assessment of the supply and demand for rare earth materials in 
        defense applications and identify which, if any, rare earth 
        material meets both of the following criteria:
                    (A) The rare earth material is critical to the 
                production, sustainment, or operation of significant 
                United States military equipment.
                    (B) The rare earth material is subject to 
                interruption of supply, based on actions or events 
                outside the control of the Government of the United 
                States.
            (2) Evaluation of supply.--The assessment shall include a 
        comprehensive evaluation of the long-term security and 
        availability of all aspects of the supply chain for rare earth 
        materials in defense applications, particularly the location and 
        number of sources at each step of the supply chain, including--
                    (A) mining of rare earth ores;
                    (B) separation of rare earth oxides;
                    (C) refining and reduction of rare earth metals;
                    (D) creation of rare earth alloys;
                    (E) manufacturing of components and systems 
                containing rare earth materials; and
                    (F) recycling of components and systems to reclaim 
                and reuse rare earth materials.
            (3) Evaluation of demand.--The assessment shall include a 
        comprehensive evaluation of the demand for and usage of rare 
        earth materials in all defense applications, including--
                    (A) approximations of the total amounts of 
                individual rare earth materials used in defense 
                applications;
                    (B) determinations of which, if any, defense 
                applications are dependent upon rare earth materials for 
                proper operation and functioning; and
                    (C) assessments of the feasibility of alternatives 
                to usage of rare earth materials in defense 
                applications.
            (4) Other studies and agencies.--Any applicable studies 
        conducted by the Department of Defense, the Comptroller General 
        of the United States, or other Federal agencies during fiscal 
        year 2010 may be considered as partial fulfillment of the 
        requirements of this section. The Secretary may consider the 
        views of other Federal agencies, as appropriate.
            (5) Specific material included.--At a minimum, the Secretary 
        shall identify sintered neodymium iron boron magnets as meeting 
        the criteria specified in paragraph (1).

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Plan.--For each rare earth material 
identified pursuant to subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall develop a 
plan to ensure the long-term availability of such rare earth material, 
with a goal of establishing an assured source of supply of such material 
in critical defense applications by December 31, 2015. In developing the 
plan, the Secretary shall consider all aspects of the material's supply 
chain, as described in subsection (a)(2). The plan shall include 
consideration of numerous risk mitigation methods with respect to the 
material, including--
            (1) an assessment of including the material in the National 
        Defense Stockpile;
            (2) in consultation with the United States Trade 
        Representative, the identification of any trade practices known 
        to the Secretary that limit the Secretary's ability to ensure 
        the long-term availability of such material or the ability to 
        meet the

[[Page 124 STAT. 4284]]

        goal of establishing an assured source of supply of such 
        material by December 31, 2015;
            (3) an assessment of the availability of financing to 
        industry, academic institutions, or not-for-profit entities to 
        provide the capacity required to ensure the availability of the 
        material, as well as potential mechanisms to increase the 
        availability of such financing;
            (4) an assessment of the benefits, if any, of Defense 
        Production Act funding to support the establishment of an 
        assured source of supply for military components;
            (5) an assessment of funding for research and development 
        related to any aspect of the rare earth material supply chain or 
        research on alternatives and substitutes;
            (6) any other risk mitigation method determined appropriate 
        by the Secretary that is consistent with the goal of 
        establishing an assured source of supply by December 31, 2015; 
        and
            (7) for steps of the rare earth material supply chain for 
        which no other risk mitigation method, as described in

                          OF A NAVAL COMBAT VESSEL AFTER FATHER 
                          VINCENT CAPODANNO.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Father Vincent Capodanno was born on February 13, 1929, 
        in Staten Island, New York.
            (2) After attending Fordham University for a year, he 
        entered the Maryknoll Missionary Seminary in upstate New York in 
        1949, and was ordained a Catholic priest in June 1957.
            (3) Father Capodanno's first assignment as a missionary was 
        working with aboriginal Taiwanese people in the mountains of 
        Taiwan where he served in a parish and later in a school. After 
        several years, Father Capodanno returned to the United States 
        for leave and then was assigned to a Maryknoll school in Hong 
        Kong.
            (4) Father Vincent Capodanno volunteered as a Navy Chaplain 
        and was commissioned a Lieutenant in the Chaplain Corps of the 
        United States Naval Reserve in December 28, 1965.
            (5) Father Vincent Capodanno selflessly extended his combat 
        tour in Vietnam on the condition he was allowed to remain with 
        the infantry.
            (6) On September 4, 1967, during a fierce battle in the 
        Thang Binh District of the Que-Son Valley in Vietnam, Father 
        Capodanno went among the wounded and dying, giving last rites 
        and caring for the injured. He was killed that day while taking 
        care of his Marines.
            (7) On January 7, 1969, Father Vincent Capodanno was awarded 
        the Medal of Honor posthumously for comforting the

[[Page 124 STAT. 4349]]

        wounded and dying during the Vietnam conflict. For his dedicated 
        service, Father Capodanno was also awarded the Bronze Star, the 
        Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation, the National 
        Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam 
        Gallantry Cross with Palm, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.
            (8) In his memory, the U.S.S. Capodanno was commissioned on 
        September 17, 1973. It is the only Naval vessel to date to have 
        received a Papal blessing by Pope John Paul II in Naples, Italy, 
        on September 4, 1981.
            (9) The U.S.S. Capodanno was decommissioned on July 30, 
        1993.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Navy should name a combat vessel of the United States 
Navy the ``U.S.S. Father Vincent Capodanno'', in honor of Father Vincent 
Capodanno, a lieutenant in the Navy Chaplain Corps.

for that fiscal year an assessment that describes and discusses the

60 days after the date on which the congressional defense committees 
receive the plan under subsection (a), the Director of the Congressional

year in which a quadrennial defense review is not submitted and the 
budget of the President submitted under section 1105(a) of title 31 
decreases the number of vessels requested in the future-years defense 
program submitted under section 221 of this title, the Secretary of the 
Navy shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on 
such decrease including--
            ``(1) an addendum to the most recent quadrennial defense 
        review that fully explains and justifies the decrease with

                          FORCE REDUCTIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that no action should be taken to 
implement the reduction of the strategic nuclear forces of the United 
States below the levels described in the Treaty between the United 
States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further 
Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms signed on April 8, 
2010 (commonly known as the ``New START

[[Page 124 STAT. 4381]]

Treaty''), unless the President submits to the congressional defense 
committees a report on such reduction, including--
            (1) the justification for such reduction;
            (2) an assessment of the strategic environment, threat, and 
        policy and the technical and operational implications of such 
        reduction; and
            (3) written certification by the President that--
                    (A) either--
                          (i) the strategic environment or the 
                      assessment of the threat allows for such 
                      reduction; or
                          (ii) technical measures to provide a 
                      commensurate or better level of safety, security, 
                      and reliability as before such reduction have been 
                      implemented for the remaining strategic nuclear 
                      forces of the United States;
                    (B) the remaining strategic nuclear forces of the 
                United States provide a sufficient means of protection 
                against unforeseen technical challenges and geopolitical 
                events;
                    (C) such reduction is compensated by other measures 
                (such as nuclear modernization, conventional forces, and 
                missile defense) that together provide a commensurate or 
                better deterrence capability and level of credibility as 
                before such reduction; and
                    (D) measures to modernize the nuclear weapons 
                complex are being implemented (or have been implemented) 
                to provide a sufficiently responsive infrastructure to 
                support the remaining strategic nuclear forces of the 
                United States.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the 2010 report on the Department 
of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review concludes that ``[a]nti-access 
strategies seek to deny outside countries the ability to project power 
into a region, thereby allowing aggression or other destabilizing 
actions to be conducted by the anti-access power. Without dominant 
capabilities to project power, the integrity of United States alliances 
and security partnerships could be called into question, reducing United 
States security and influence and increasing the possibility of 
conflict''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, in light 
of the finding in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense should ensure 
that the United States has the appropriate authorities, capabilities, 
and force structure to defend against any potential future threats posed 
by the anti-access and area-denial capabilities of potentially hostile 
foreign countries.

        hostile foreign countries, including an identification of the 
        foreign countries with such capabilities, the nature of such 
        capabilities, and the possible advances in such capabilities 
        over the next 10 years.
            (2) A description of any efforts by the Department of 
        Defense to address the potential future threats posed by the 
        anti-access and area-denial capabilities of potentially hostile 
        foreign countries.

        countries.

provide the contractor for a chemical demilitarization facility an 
incentive to accelerate the safe elimination of the United States

specify the target incentive ranges of costs for completion of 
destruction operations and facility closure activities, respectively, as

concerned. An incentives clause shall require a proportionate reduction

contractor exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are 
the responsibility of the contractor.

a chemical demilitarization facility under an incentives clause under 
this subsection shall be based upon a determination by the Secretary on 
how early in the target incentive range specified in such clause 
destruction operations or facility closure activities, as the case may 
be, are completed.

shall be consistent with the obligation of the Secretary of Defense

the destruction of the lethal chemical agents and munitions.

                          ALASKA.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the Alaska Railroad proposes the 
extension of its railroad corridor over approximately 950 acres of land 
located south and east of North Pole, Alaska, including lands located 
near or adjacent to the Chena River spillway, Eielson Air Force Base, 
Tanana Flats Training Area (Fort Wainwright), Donnelly Training Area 
(Fort Wainwright), and Fort Greely.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force should 
explore means of accommodating the railroad corridor expansion referred 
to in subsection (a) using existing authorities that will not adversely 
impact military missions, operations, and training.
SEC. 2856. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPROVING MILITARY HOUSING FOR 
                          MEMBERS OF THE AIR FORCE.

    (a) Finding.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the mid-1990s, the Department of Defense became 
        concerned that inadequate and poor quality housing for members 
        of the Armed Forces was adversely affecting the quality of life 
        for members and their families and adversely affecting military 
        readiness by contributing to decisions by members to leave the 
        Armed Forces.
            (2) At that time, the Department of Defense designated about 
        180,000 houses, or nearly two-thirds of its domestic family 
        housing inventory, as inadequate and needing repair or complete 
        replacement.
            (3) The Department of Defense believed that it would need 
        about $20,000,000,000 in appropriated funds and would take up to 
        40 years to eliminate poor quality military housing through new 
        construction or renovation using its traditional military 
        construction approach.
            (4) In 1996, Congress enacted the Military Housing 
        Privatization Initiative to provide the Department of Defense 
        with a variety of authorities to obtain private sector financing

[[Page 124 STAT. 4479]]

        and management for the repair, renovation, construction, and 
        management of military family housing.
            (5) The Air Force has used the Military Housing 
        Privatization Initiative to award 27 projects at 44 military 
        bases to improve over 37,000 homes.
            (6) The Air Force has received $7,100,000,000 in total 
        development investment from the private sector for new housing 
        with a taxpayer contribution of approximately $425,000,000, 
        representing a 15 to 1 leveraging of taxpayer dollars.
            (7) The Air Force, like the other military services, has 
        been able to leverage varying conditions of housing at military 
        bases into fiscally viable projects by packaging housing 
        inventories at multiple bases into a single transaction.
            (8) Congress has approved transactions involving the 
        packaging of multiple bases as a critical tool to maximize the 
        efficient use of taxpayer funds.
            (9) Congress supports the goal of the Air Force to complete 
        transactions for the repair, renovation, construction, and 
        management of 100 percent of their military family housing 
        inventory in the United States by December 31, 2012.
            (10) The Air Force currently has 6 project solicitations 
        prepared for open competition at 22 Air Force installations to 
        improve over 15,000 homes.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Air Force should use existing authority to carry out 
solicitations for the 6 military housing projects involving the 
packaging of 22 bases consistent with the goal of improving 15,000 homes 
for Air Force personnel and their families by December 31, 2012.
SEC. 2857. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RECREATIONAL HUNTING AND 
                          FISHING ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) military installations that permit public access for 
        recreational hunting and fishing should continue to permit such 
        hunting and fishing where appropriate;
            (2) permitting the public to access military installations 
        for recreational hunting and fishing benefits local communities 
        by conserving and promoting the outdoors and establishing 
        positive relations between the civilian and defense sectors;
            (3) any military installations that make recreational 
        hunting and fishing permits available for purchase should 
        provide a discounted rate for active and retired members of the 
        Armed Forces and veterans with disabilities; and
            (4) the Department of Defense, all of the service branches, 
        and military installations that permit public access for 
        recreational hunting and fishing should promote access to such 
        installations by making the appropriate accommodations for 
        members of the Armed Forces and veterans with disabilities.
