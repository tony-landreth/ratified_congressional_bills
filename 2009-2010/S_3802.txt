SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Theodore ``Ted'' Fulton Stevens, who began serving in 
        the Senate 9 years after Alaska was admitted to Statehood, 
        represented the people of the State of Alaska with distinction 
        in the Senate for over 40 years from 1968 to 2009 and played a 
        significant role in the transformation of the State of Alaska 
        from an impoverished territory to a full-fledged State through 
        the assistance he provided in building energy facilities, 
        hospitals and clinics, roads, docks, airports, water and sewer 
        facilities, schools, and other community facilities in the State 
        of Alaska, which earned him recognition as ``Alaskan of the 
        Century'' from the Alaska Legislature in 2000;
            (2) Ted Stevens distinguished himself as a transport pilot 
        during World War II in support of the ``Flying Tigers'' of the 
        United States Army Air Corps, 14th Air Force, earning 2 
        Distinguished Flying Crosses and other decorations for his skill 
        and bravery;
            (3) Ted Stevens, after serving as a United States Attorney 
        in the territory of Alaska, came to Washington, District of 
        Columbia in 1956 to serve in the Eisenhower Administration in 
        the Department of the Interior, where he was a leading force in 
        securing the legislation that led to the admission of Alaska as 
        the 49th State on January 3, 1959, and then as Solicitor of the 
        Department of the Interior;
            (4) in 1961, Ted Stevens returned to the State of Alaska 
        and, in 1964, was elected to the Alaska House of 
        Representatives, where he was subsequently elected as Speaker 
        pro tempore and majority leader until his appointment on 
        December 24, 1968, to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by 
        the death of Senator E.L. Bartlett;
            (5) Ted Stevens, the longest-serving Republican Senator in 
        the history of the Senate, served as President pro tempore of 
        the Senate from 2003 through 2007 and as President pro tempore 
        emeritus from 2008 to 2009, and over the course

[[Page 124 STAT. 3051]]

        of his career in the Senate, Ted Stevens served as assistant 
        Republican leader, Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, 
        Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, Chairman 
        of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Chairman of the 
        Committee on Appropriations, and Chairman of the Committee on 
        Commerce, Science, and Transportation;
            (6) Ted Stevens worked tirelessly for the enactment of the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), 
        which provided for the conveyance of approximately 44,000,000 
        acres of land in the State of Alaska to the Aleut, Eskimo, and 
        Indian peoples and created Native Corporations to secure the 
        long-term economic, cultural, and political empowerment of the 
        Native peoples of the State of Alaska;
            (7) Ted Stevens was a leader in shaping the communications 
        policies of the United States, as he helped to establish the 
        spectrum auction policy, negotiated the Telecommunications Act 
        of 1996, authored the Digital Television Transition and Public 
        Safety Act of 2005 (47 U.S.C. 309 note; Public Law 109-171), and 
        passionately advocated for the connection of rural America to 
        the rest of the world and to improve the lives of the people of 
        the United States through the use of telemedicine and distance 
        learning;
            (8) Ted Stevens was a conservationist who championed the 
        safe development of the natural resources of the United States, 
        as illustrated by his authorship of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline 
        Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.), the Magnuson-Stevens 
        Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et 
        seq.), which established the 200-mile exclusive economic zone 
        and led to a reduction in the dominance of foreign fishing 
        fleets in the fisheries of the United States, the Magnuson-
        Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act 
        of 2006 (Public Law 109-479; 120 Stat. 3575), which established 
        conservation measures designed to end overfishing, and the High 
        Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act (16 U.S.C. 1826a et 
        seq.), which provided for the denial of entry into ports of the 
        United States and the imposition of sanctions on vessels 
        carrying out large-scale driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive 
        economic zone of any nation;
            (9) Ted Stevens was committed to health and fitness in his 
        personal life and in his legislative accomplishments, as 
        illustrated by his authorship of the Ted Stevens Amateur and 
        Olympic Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et seq.), his encouragement 
        of providing equality to female athletes through the enactment 
        of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 
        et seq.), and his leadership in improving physical education 
        programs in schools through the Carol M. White Physical 
        Education Program (20 U.S.C. 7261 et seq.);
            (10) Ted Stevens unconditionally supported the needs of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States through visits to soldiers, 
        sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guardsmen in every major 
        military conflict and war zone where United States military 
        personnel have been assigned during his service in the Senate, 
        including Vietnam, Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and 
        Afghanistan, and in his role as Chairman and Ranking Member of 
        the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations for more than 20 
        years;

[[Page 124 STAT. 3052]]

            (11) Ted Stevens was a devoted husband, father, and 
        grandfather who worked to promote family-friendly policies in 
        the Federal government;
            (12) Ted Stevens was well-respected for reaching across the 
        aisle to forge bipartisan alliances and enjoyed many close 
        friendships with colleagues in both political parties and with 
        his staff, who were deeply loyal to him; and
            (13) the designation of the unnamed highest peak in the 
        State of Alaska, along with an icefield in the Chugach National 
        Forest in that State, in honor of Ted Stevens would be a fitting 
        tribute to his honorable life and legacy.
