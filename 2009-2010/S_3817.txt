SEC. 301. CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT AND ADOPTION 
                        REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--Section 201 of the Child Abuse Prevention and 
Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 5111) is amended--
            (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) on the last day of fiscal year 2009, some 424,000 
        children were living in temporary foster family homes or other 
        foster care settings;
            ``(2) most children in foster care are victims of child 
        abuse or neglect by their biological parents and their entry 
        into foster care brought them the additional trauma of 
        separation from their homes and often their communities;
            ``(3) on average, children entering foster care have more 
        physical and mental health needs than do children in the general 
        population, and some require intensive services because the 
        children entering foster care--
                    ``(A) were born to mothers who did not receive 
                prenatal care;
                    ``(B) were born with life-threatening conditions or 
                disabilities;
                    ``(C) were born addicted to alcohol or other drugs; 
                or
                    ``(D) have HIV/AIDS;
            ``(4) each year, thousands of children in foster care, 
        regardless of their age, the size of the sibling group they are 
        a part of, their racial or ethnic status, their medical 
        condition, or any physical, mental or emotional disability they 
        may have, are in need of placement with permanent, loving, 
        adoptive families;
            ``(5)(A) States have made important strides in increasing 
        the number of children who are placed in permanent homes with 
        adoptive parents and in reducing the length of time children 
        wait for such a placement; and
            ``(B) many thousands of children, however, still remain in 
        institutions or foster homes solely because of legal and other 
        barriers to such a placement;
            ``(6)(A) on the last day of fiscal year 2009, there were 
        115,000 children waiting for adoption;
            ``(B) children waiting for adoption have had parental rights 
        of all living parents terminated or the children have a 
        permanency goal of adoption;

            ``(C)(i) the average age of children adopted with public 
        child welfare agency involvement during fiscal year 2009 was a 
        little more than 6 years; and
            ``(ii) the average age of children waiting for adoption on 
        the last day of that fiscal year was a little more than 8 years 
        of age and more than 30,000 of those children were 12 years of 
        age or older; and
            ``(D)(i) 25 percent of the children adopted with public 
        child welfare agency involvement during fiscal year 2009 were 
        African-American; and
            ``(ii) 30 percent of the children waiting for adoption on 
        the last day of fiscal year 2009 were African-American;
            ``(7) adoption may be the best alternative for assuring the 
        healthy development of children placed in foster care;
            ``(8) there are qualified persons seeking to adopt such 
        children who are unable to do so because of barriers to their 
        placement and adoption; and
            ``(9) in order both to enhance the stability of and love in 
        the home environments of such children and to avoid wasteful 
        expenditures of public funds, such children--
                    ``(A) should not have medically indicated treatment 
                withheld from them; or

                when adoption is appropriate and families can be found 
                for such children.''; and

                after ``particularly''; and
                    (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the 
                following:

                adoption; and
                    ``(C) connect placement agencies, prospective 
                adoptive parents, and adoptive parents to resources 
                designed to reduce barriers to adoption, support 
                adoptive families, and ensure permanency; and''.

    (b) Information and Services.--Section 203 of the Child Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 
5113) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking all that follows

        minority children, and children with special needs, particularly 
        infants and toddlers with disabilities who have life-threatening
