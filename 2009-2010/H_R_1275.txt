        the parcels of Federal land and non-Federal land may not have

        land to proceed.
            (4) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Timing.--It is the intent of 
        Congress that at least the first phase of the exchange of land

                lease or authorization to develop oil shale resources;
                    (B) the amount that would have been received by the 
                Federal Government under the applicable royalty rate if 
                the oil shale resources had been retained in Federal 
                ownership; and
                    (C) 50 percent of any other payment received by the 
                State pursuant to any lease or authorization to develop
