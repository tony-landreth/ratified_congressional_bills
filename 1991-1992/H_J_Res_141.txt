Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning May 13, 1991, as `National Senior Nutrition
Week'.
Whereas in fiscal year 1991 over 145,000,000 meals will be served in
congregate settings to approximately 2,700,000 Americans age 60 and over,
meeting the needs of both good nutrition and fellowship;
Whereas in fiscal year 1991 over 115,000,000 home-delivered meals will also
be served to approximately 728,000 Americans age 60 and over;
Whereas the dedication of staff and volunteers in helping older people
receive hot nutritious meals each day ensures the continued well-being and
independence of so many older Americans;
Whereas community-based congregate and home-delivered meal programs make
possible the joint use of public and private funds and resources to serve
older people; and
Whereas since 1963 the month of May has been designated as `Older Americans
Month': Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning May 13, 1991,
 is designated as `National Senior Nutrition Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the
 United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
