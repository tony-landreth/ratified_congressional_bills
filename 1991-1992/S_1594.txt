AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
An Act
To honor and commend the efforts of Terry Beirn, to amend the Public Health
Service Act to rename and make technical amendments to the community-based
AIDS research initiative, and for other purposes.
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 This Act may be cited as the `Terry Beirn Community Based AIDS Research
 Initiative Act of 1991'.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
 (1) community-based clinical trials complement the National Institute of
 Allergy and Infectious Diseases' university-based research in order to
 provide increased access to experimental therapies;
 (2) community-based clinical trials provide an efficient and cost-effective
 means to develop new HIV-related treatments, benefiting all people living
 with HIV disease and other illnesses; and
 (3) because the community-based clinical trials model has a proven ability
 to conduct rapid trials that meet the very highest standards of scientific
 inquiry, this program should be reauthorized and significantly expanded.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that, because of Terry
 Beirn's tireless efforts to foster a partnership among all parties invested in
 AIDS research (including the National Institutes of Health university-based
 research system, primary care physicians practicing in the community, and
 patients), the community-based clinical trials program should be renamed
 as the `Terry Beirn Community-Based AIDS Research Initiative' in his honor.
SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED EVALUATIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL THERAPIES.
