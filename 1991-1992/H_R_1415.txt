 that agency's procedures for such review, except that such declassification
 review shall be completed by the originating agency within 120 days after
 such records are submitted for review. If the originating agency determines
 that any such record is not declassifiable because of a continuing need to
 protect sources and methods for the collection of intelligence information
 or to protect other sensitive national security information, then the
 originating agency shall attempt to make such deletions in the text as will
 make the record declassifiable.
 `(2) If the Historian determines that the meaning of the records proposed for
 inclusion in a volume of the FRUS series would be so altered or changed by

 inaccurate or incomplete historical record, then the Advisory Committee
 shall so advise the Secretary of State and submit recommendations to resolve
 the issue.
 `(5)(A) The Advisory Committee shall have full and complete access to
 the original text of any record in which deletions have been made. In the
 event that the head of any originating agency considers it necessary to

 of joint cooperation with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Lao
 People's Democratic Republic to achieve credible answers for the families of
 America's servicemen and civilians who are missing or otherwise unaccounted
 for, including primary-next-of-kin access to all records and information
 resulting from the process of joint investigations, surveys, and excavations;

 to the families of POW/MIAs and to American veterans organizations, such
 as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of
 America in their efforts to account for POW/MIAs;
 (4) General John Vessey should be highly commended for his personal commitment
 to resolving the POW/MIA issue;
 (5) the United States should develop a means to obtain the fullest possible
 accounting for Americans who are listed as missing or otherwise unaccounted
 for in Cambodia, without placing this humanitarian objective into conflict
 with United States efforts to obtain an acceptable political settlement of
 the Cambodian situation; and
 (6) the United States should heighten responsible public awareness of the
 Americans still missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Southeast Asia
 through the dissemination of factual data.
SEC. 355. CHINA'S ILLEGAL CONTROL OF TIBET.

 (2) Tibet's true representatives are the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government
 in exile as recognized by the Tibetan people;
 (3) Tibet has maintained throughout its history a distinctive and sovereign
 national, cultural, and religious identity separate from that of China
 and, except during periods of illegal Chinese occupation, has maintained
 a separate and sovereign political and territorial identity;
 (4) historical evidence of this separate identity may be found in Chinese
 archival documents and traditional dynastic histories, in United States
 recognition of Tibetan neutrality during World War II, and in the fact
 that a number of countries including the United States, Mongolia, Bhutan,
 Sikkim, Nepal, India, Japan, Great Britain, and Russia recognized Tibet
 as an independent nation or dealt with Tibet independently of any Chinese
 government;
 (5) in 1949-1950, China launched an armed invasion of Tibet in contravention

 (1) the Warsaw Pact military alliance no longer exists;
 (2) the Soviet Union's capability to pose a military threat to European
 security has retreated radically; and
 (3) in light of the retreating Soviet threat, West European electorates are
 unlikely to approve the deployment of new United States tactical nuclear

TITLE IV--ARMS TRANSFERS RESTRAINT POLICY FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND PERSIAN
GULF REGION
SEC. 401. FINDINGS.
 The Congress finds that--
 (1) nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, which accounted for
 over 40 percent of the international trade in weapons and related equipment
 and services during the decade of the 1980's, are the principal market for
 the worldwide arms trade;
 (2) regional instability, large financial resources, and the desire of
 arms-supplying governments to gain influence in the Middle East and Persian
 Gulf region, contribute to a regional arms race;
 (3) the continued proliferation of weapons and related equipment and services
 contribute further to a regional arms race in the Middle East and Persian
 Gulf region that is politically, economically, and militarily destabilizing;
 (4) the continued proliferation of unconventional weapons, including nuclear,
 biological, and chemical weapons, as well as delivery systems associated
 with those weapons, poses an urgent threat to security and stability in
 the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;
 (5) the continued proliferation of ballistic missile technologies and
 ballistic missile systems that are capable of delivering conventional,
 nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads undermines security and stability
 in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;
 (6) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region
 would be enhanced by establishing a stable military balance among regional
 powers by restraining and reducing both conventional and unconventional
 weapons;
 (7) security, stability, peace, and prosperity in the Middle East and Persian
 Gulf region are important to the welfare of the international economy and
 to the national security interests of the United States;
 (8) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region
 would be enhanced through the development of a multilateral arms transfer and
 control regime similar to those of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, the Missile
 Technology Control Regime, and the Australia Chemical Weapons Suppliers Group;
 (9) such a regime should be developed, implemented, and agreed to through
 multilateral negotiations, including under the auspices of the 5 permanent
 members of the United Nations Security Council;
 (10) confidence-building arms control measures such as the establishment of a
 centralized arms trade registry at the United Nations, greater multinational
 transparency on the transfer of defense articles and services prior
 to agreement or transfer, cooperative verification measures, advanced
 notification of military exercises, information exchanges, on-site
 inspections, and creation of a Middle East and Persian Gulf Conflict
 Prevention Center, are important to implement an effective multilateral
 arms transfer and control regime;
 (11) as an interim step, the United States should consider introducing,
 during the ongoing negotiations on confidence security-building measures
 at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), a proposal
 regarding the international exchange of information, on an annual basis,
 on the sale and transfer of major military equipment, particularly to the
 Middle East and Persian Gulf region; and
 (12) such a regime should be applied to other regions with the ultimate
 objective of achieving an effective global arms transfer and control regime,
 implemented and enforced through the United Nations Security Council, that--
 (A) includes a linkage of humanitarian and developmental objectives with
 security objectives in Third World countries, particularly the poorest of
 the poor countries; and
 (B) encourages countries selling military equipment and services to consider
 the following factors before making conventional arms sales: the security
 needs of the purchasing countries, the level of defense expenditures by
 the purchasing countries, and the level of indigenous production of the
 purchasing countries.

 these negotiations, the President should propose to the 5 permanent members
 of the United Nations Security Council a temporary moratorium on the sale
 and transfer of major military equipment to nations in the Middle East and
 Persian Gulf region until such time as the 5 permanent members agree to a
 multilateral arms transfer and control regime.
 (b) PURPOSE OF THE REGIME- The purpose of the multilateral arms transfer
 and control regime should be--

 (B) achieving transparency among arms suppliers nations through advanced
 notification of agreement to, or transfer of, conventional major military
 equipment; and
 (C) developing and adopting common and comprehensive control guidelines on
 the sale and transfer of conventional major military equipment to the region;
 (2) to halt the proliferation of unconventional weapons, including nuclear,
 biological, and chemical weapons, as well as delivery systems associated
