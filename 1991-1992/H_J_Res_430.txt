One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate May 4, 1992, through May 10, 1992, as `Public Service Recognition
Week'.
Whereas public employees at every level of government faithfully serve their
fellow Americans, and there are now nine million employees in city and county
government, four million employees in State government, and over four million
Federal civilian and military employees;
Whereas Americans are aware of the many contributions public employees have
made to the quality of their lives, in occupations that run the gamut from
astronauts to zoologists, including scientists, police officers, teachers,
doctors, forest rangers, engineers, food inspectors, researchers, and foreign
service agents, among others;
Whereas the Nation should value a professional civil service whose highest
principle is one of patriotism, whose foremost commitment is to excellence,
and whose experience and expertise are a national resource to be used and
respected;
Whereas the millions of workers who serve the Nation are men and women of
knowledge, ability, and integrity who deserve to be recognized for their
dedicated service; and
Whereas designating a week to honor these employees will provide a dual
opportunity to pay tribute to our public employees and to inform the American
people about the scope and importance of public service, including the range of
employment opportunities available to our young people: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week of May 4 through May 10,
 1992, is designated as `Public Service Recognition Week'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
