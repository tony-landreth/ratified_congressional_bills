H.J.Res.167
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating June 14, 1991, and June 14, 1992, each as `Baltic Freedom Day'.
Whereas on June 14, 1941, the Soviet Union began mass deportation to Siberia
of peoples from the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania;
Whereas the United States has for the past 50 years refused to recognize
the forced incorporation of the Baltic republics into the Soviet Union;
Whereas the Soviet Union has consistently refused to follow the request of
the United States that it begin negotiating a peaceful end to the occupation
of the Baltic republics;
Whereas the Baltic republics, which in 1990 reaffirmed independence from the
Soviet Union, have not been allowed to pursue policies which would realize
the intent of these declarations;
Whereas the armed forces and secret police of the Soviet Union continue to
maintain an extensive presence in the Baltic republics;
Whereas, although the Soviet Union has stated its intention to pursue policies
of Glasnost and Perestroika, recent events in the Baltic republics indicate
that the Soviet Union is not fully committed to those policies;
Whereas the Soviet Union has consistently pursued measures which are contrary
to its stated goal of sovereignty for Soviet republics; and
Whereas the Soviet Union has not acted in accord with the Helsinki agreements,
which it signed 15 years ago, because it has not allowed the Baltic republics
to exercise their respective rights to self-determination: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That June 14, 1991, and June 14, 1992,
 are each designated as `Baltic Freedom Day', and the President of the United
 States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the
 people of the United States to observe such days with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
