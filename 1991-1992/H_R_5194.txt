SEC. 3. RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH.
  (a) FINDINGS- Section 302 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
  Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5701) is amended--
  (1) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:
  `(1) juveniles who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from
  home without parental permission, are at risk of developing serious health
  and other problems because they lack sufficient resources to obtain care and
  may live on the street for extended periods thereby endangering themselves
  and creating a substantial law enforcement problem for communities in
  which they congregate;';
  (2) by striking `and' at the end of paragraph (4);
  (3) in paragraph (5) by striking `temporary' and all that follows through
  the period at the end and inserting `care (including preventive services,
  emergency shelter services, and extended residential shelter) outside the
  welfare system and the law enforcement system;' and
  (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
  `(6) runaway and homeless youth have a disproportionate share of health,
  behavioral, and emotional problems compared to the general population of
  youth, but have less access to health care and other appropriate services
  and therefore may need access to longer periods of residential care,
  more intensive aftercare service, and other assistance;
  `(7) to make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless
  youth, and other street youth need opportunities to complete high school or
  earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment;
  `(8) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the
  responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an accurate national
  reporting system and to develop an effective system of care including
  prevention, emergency shelter services, and longer residential care outside
  the public welfare and law enforcement structures;
  `(9) early intervention services (such as home-based services) are needed
  to prevent runaway and homeless youth from becoming involved in the juvenile
  justice system and other law enforcement systems; and
  `(10) street-based services that target runaway and homeless youth where
  they congregate are needed to reach youth who require assistance but who
  would not otherwise avail themselves of such assistance or services without
  street-based outreach.'.

  of child protection services to protect suffering children;
  (2) the documentary described in paragraph (1) showed the serious need
  for systemic changes in our child welfare protection system;
  (3) thorough, coordinated, and comprehensive investigation will, it is
  hoped, lead to the prevention of abuse, neglect, or death in the future;
  (4) an undue burden is placed on investigation due to strict Federal and
  State laws and regulations regarding confidentiality;
  (5) while the Congress recognizes the importance of maintaining the
  confidentiality of records pertaining to child abuse, neglect, and death,
  often the purpose of confidentiality laws and regulations are defeated
  when they have the effect of protecting those responsible;
  (6) comprehensive and coordinated interagency communication needs to
  be established, with adequate provisions to protect against the public
  disclosure of any detrimental information need to be established;
  (7) certain States, including Georgia, North Carolina, California,
  Missouri, Arizona, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Oregon, have taken steps to
  establish by statute interagency, multidisciplinary fatality review teams
  to fully investigate incidents of death believed to be caused by child
  abuse or neglect;
  (8) teams such as those described in paragraph (7) should be established
  in every State, and their scope of review should be expanded to include
  egregious incidents of child abuse and neglect before the child in question
  dies; and
  (9) teams such as those described in paragraph (7) will increase the
  accountability of child protection services.
  (b) MODIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION REGARDING STATE GRANTS UNDER
  CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT- Section 107(b)(4) of the Child
  Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5106A(b)(4)) is amended to
  read as follows:
  `(4) provide for--
  `(A) methods to preserve the confidentiality of all records in order to
  protect the rights of the child and of the child's parents or guardians,
  including methods to ensure that disclosure (and redisclosure) of information
  concerning child abuse or neglect involving specific individuals is made
  only to persons or entities that the State determines have a need for such
  information directly related to purposes of this Act; and
  `(B) requirements for the prompt disclosure of all relevant information
  to any Federal, State, or local governmental entity, or any agent of
  such entity, with a need for such information in order to carry out its
  responsibilities under law to protect children from abuse and neglect;'.
  (c) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that each
  State should review and reform of the system in the State for protecting
  against child abuse and neglect, including implementing formal interagency,
  multidisciplinary teams--
  (1) to review--
  (A) all cases of child death in which the child was previously known by
  the State to have been abused or neglected; and
  (B) incidents of child abuse before a child dies when there is evidence
  of negligent handling by the State,
in order to hold the State accountable; and
  (2) to make recommendations regarding the outcomes of individual cases and
  systemic changes in the State's procedures for protecting against child
  abuse and neglect.
