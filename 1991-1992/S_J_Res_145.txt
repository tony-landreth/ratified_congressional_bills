S.J.Res.145
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning November 10, 1991, as `National Women Veterans
Recognition Week'.
Whereas there are more than 1,200,000 women veterans in the United States
representing 4.2 percent of the total veteran population;
Whereas the number of women serving in the United States Armed Forces and
the number of women veterans continue to increase;
Whereas women veterans have contributed greatly to the security of the United
States through honorable military service, often involving great hardship
and danger;
Whereas women are performing a wider range of tasks in the United States
Armed Forces, as demonstrated by the participation of women in the military
actions taken in Panama and the Persian Gulf region;
Whereas the special needs of women veterans, especially in the area of
health care, have often been overlooked or inadequately addressed by the
Federal Government;
Whereas the lack of attention to the special needs of women veterans has
discouraged or prevented many women veterans from taking full advantage of
the benefits and services to which they are entitled; and
Whereas designating a week to recognize women veterans will help both to
promote important gains made by women veterans and to focus attention on
the special needs of women veterans: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning November 10,
 1991, is designated as `National Women Veterans Recognition Week', and
 the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
