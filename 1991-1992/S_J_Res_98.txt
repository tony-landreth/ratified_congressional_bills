S.J.Res. 98
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To express appreciation for the benefit brought to the Nation by Amtrak
during its
twenty years of existence.
Whereas May 1, 1991, will mark the twentieth anniversary of the commencement
of intercity rail passenger service by the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation, better known as Amtrak;
Whereas Amtrak has dramatically improved both the quality and the economics
of rail passenger service in the past twenty years and provides a marketable
and highly desired national transportation service, with over two hundred
and twenty trains each day operating over twenty-four thousand track miles
through forty-four States;
Whereas Amtrak carries passengers more miles and longer distances than
carried by all the passenger railroads in 1970 prior to the establishment
of Amtrak, provides transportation to nearly twenty-two million intercity
and eighteen million commuter passengers each year, and serves as a vital
national transportation link to rural America, which increasingly is losing
other modes of public transportation;
Whereas Amtrak employs nearly twenty-four thousand railroad employees,
who cumulatively earn over $1,000,000,000 in annual taxable income, and
procures over $350,000,000 in goods and services from domestic companies
across the country;
Whereas the country is witnessing a remarkable resurgence in support for
a national rail passenger system, reflected by trains that frequently are
sold out far in advance of departure and by increasing demands across the
country for additional Amtrak service;
Whereas Amtrak is now covering over 80 percent of its operating costs without
Federal support compared to just 50 percent in 1981, and is committed to
covering 100 percent of its operating costs by the year 2000;
Whereas rail passenger service increasingly is recognized as a critical element
of a balanced national transportation system and as an energy efficient,
environmentally benign alternative to growing highway and airport congestion;
Whereas Congress has repeatedly been required to preserve funding for a
national rail passenger system in the face of proposals to eliminate Federal
assistance for Amtrak, and is proud of the success Amtrak has achieved in
providing increasingly better service at less cost to the Federal taxpayer; and
Whereas Amtrak has a critical role to play in the future of the Nation's
surface transportation system, as the operator of both conventional and
high-speed rail systems, new systems based on magnetic levitation, and
contract commuter rail systems: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the creation of Amtrak had the important
 effect of preserving a national rail passenger system and of providing
 Americans with an energy efficient, environmentally preferable transportation
 alternative, and that the need for a balanced national transportation system
 in this country dictates that Federal and State transportation planners
 consider the many advantages of improved rail passenger service as they
 look to addressing national and regional transportation concerns.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
