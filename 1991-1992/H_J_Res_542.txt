H.J.Res. 542
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning November 8, 1992, as `Hire a Veteran Week'.
Whereas the people of the  United States have a deep appreciation and respect
for the men and women who serve our Nation in the Armed Forces;
Whereas, although veterans possess special qualities and skills which make
them ideal candidates for employment, many veterans encounter difficulties
in securing employment;
Whereas military spending cuts and reductions-in-force in the Armed Forces will
send tens of thousands of veterans looking for employment in the job market;
Whereas it would be inconsiderate and contrary to the economic competitiveness
of our Nation to neglect the post-military needs of the men and women who
served our Nation in the Armed Forces; and
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Labor,
the Office of Personnel Management, and many State and local governments
administer veterans programs and have veterans employment representatives
both to ensure that veterans receive the services to which they are entitled
and to promote employer interest in hiring veterans: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning November 8,
  1992, is hereby designated as `Hire a Veteran Week', and the President is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon employers,
  labor organizations, veterans organizations, and Federal, State, and local
  governmental agencies to lend their support to the campaign to increase
  employment of the men and women who have served our Nation in the Armed
  Forces.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
