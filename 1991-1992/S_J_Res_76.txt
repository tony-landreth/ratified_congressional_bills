Joint Resolution
Commending the Peace Corps and the current and former Peace Corps volunteers on
the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the Peace Corps.
Whereas, on March 1, 1991, the Peace Corps of the United States of America
concludes 30 years of promoting world peace and friendship, making available
volunteers to help the peoples of other countries to meet their needs, and
promoting mutual understanding between such peoples and the American people;
Whereas over 125,000 Americans have served in the Peace Corps in over 100
countries around the world;
Whereas Peace Corps programs and the efforts of individual volunteers have
added significantly to mutual understanding between the people of the United
States and the peoples of other countries;
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers work with their host country counterparts
in seeking long-term solutions to complex human problems through efforts
in education, agriculture, health, the environment, urban development,
and small business;
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers have returned to their communities enriched
by their experiences, more knowledgeable of the world, and more understanding
of the challenges of building a lasting peace;
Whereas former Peace Corps volunteers continue to maintain friendships with
the people of the countries with whom they served, thereby furthering the
goals of international understanding and peace;
Whereas former Peace Corps volunteers continue to engage in volunteer-related
activities in the United States, including activities that meet educational
and other needs in the United States;
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers are now serving in more countries than ever
before in all regions of the world; and
Whereas the response of Americans to the Peace Corps' call to serve continues
to exceed the Peace Corps' recruiting requirements: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That, on the occasion of the thirtieth
 anniversary of the establishment of the Peace Corps, the Congress (1) commends
 the Peace Corps and all those who have served as Peace Corps volunteers for
 the great contributions they have made to world peace and understanding,
 to the betterment of the lives of the citizens of the countries where
 volunteers have served, and to our own country, (2) reaffirms the United
 States' commitment, through the Peace Corps, to help peoples in countries
