H.J.Res.219
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning June 9, 1991, as `National Scleroderma
Awareness Week'.
Whereas scleroderma is a disease caused by excessive production of collagen,
the main fibrous component of connective tissue, the effects of which are
hardening of the skin and internal organs, such as the esophagus, lungs,
kidney, and heart;
Whereas approximately 300,000 people in the United States suffer from
scleroderma, and women of childbearing years suffer from the disease 3 times
more frequently than men;
Whereas scleroderma, a painful, crippling, and disfiguring disease, is often
progressive and can result in premature death;
Whereas the symptoms of scleroderma are variable and therefore complicate
and confuse diagnosis of the disease;
Whereas the cause of and cure for scleroderma are unknown; and
Whereas scleroderma is an orphan disease that requires intensive research
to improve treatment and to discover its cause and cure: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning June 9, 1991, is
 designated as `National Scleroderma Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the
 United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
