One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating September 1992 as `Childhood Cancer Month'.
Whereas dramatic progress has been made in the early diagnosis and treatment
of cancer and, as a result, young cancer victims and their families no longer
need to relinquish their dreams for the future;
Whereas according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the number
of child deaths from cancer in the United States declined by 36 percent
between 1973 and 1987;
Whereas despite such encouraging progress, cancer deaths continue to be the
leading cause of death by disease among children between the ages of 3 and 14;
Whereas families facing the specter of childhood cancer need the best possible
medical care and emotional support that can be provided;
Whereas brothers and sisters of young cancer victims need special consideration
both at home and at school;
Whereas young cancer victims need financial help, understanding and compassion,
and the opportunity to express and pursue the fresh, unjaded dreams that
are the hallmark of childhood;
Whereas many private organizations (including the National Cancer Institute)
and government agencies throughout the United States are working to meet the
needs of children with cancer and hundreds of private volunteer organizations
at both the national and international level (including the American Cancer
Society, the Leukemia Society of America, the Candlelighters Childhood
Cancer Foundation, and the Ronald McDonald Foundation) are helping parents
and children to cope with this tremendous problem; and
Whereas recognition should be given to the dedication and hard work of
scientists, health care professionals, and volunteers who are working to
overcome childhood cancer, to assist its victims, and to express admiration
and support for the courageous youngsters and parents who struggle with this
disease: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That September 1992 is designated as
 `Childhood Cancer Month', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
