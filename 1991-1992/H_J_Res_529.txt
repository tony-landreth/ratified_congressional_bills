One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Supporting the planting of 500 redwood trees from California in Spain in
commemoration of the quincentenary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus
and designating the trees as a gift to the people of Spain.
Whereas the voyage of Christopher Columbus across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492
established permanent communications between the Eastern and the Western
Hemispheres and launched the greatest migration of human beings in the
history of the world;
Whereas such voyage stimulated the first circumnavigation of the globe and
other explorations that gave humankind its first genuine understanding of
the Earth's geography;
Whereas such voyage inaugurated a new world that led to the formation of
the United States; and
Whereas the quincentenary of such voyage is an appropriate time for its
commemoration by the planting of a grove of redwood trees from California on
the northwest coast of Spain, facing the Atlantic Ocean, so that during the
next 5 centuries, as the trees grow from seedlings to their full noble grandeur
in the soil of the Eastern Hemisphere, they will give to each individual
who visits them an experience of the awesome potentials and wondrous beauty
of Creation and represent the hope for a future of growing friendship among
the peoples of the Eastern and the Western Hemispheres: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That--
  (1) the Congress supports the planting of 500 redwood trees from California
  on the northwest coast of Spain that is being organized by persons in the
  United States in cooperation with agencies of the Government of Spain in
  commemoration of the quincentenary of the voyage of Christopher Columbus
  to the New World; and
  (2) such trees, which will be planted in December 1992 on land set aside
  for that purpose by authority of the Council of Galicia and the community
  of Montes de San Xoan in the Province of Pontevedra and supervised by the
  forestry service of such Province, are designated as a gift to the people
  of Spain made in the name of the people of the United States.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
