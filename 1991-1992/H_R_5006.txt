  the United States against limited attacks of ballistic missiles;'.
  (b) ELIMINATION OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM ELEMENT FROM SDI-
  (1) Section 235(a) of such Act (105 Stat. 1323) is amended--

  States for the military department to do so; and

OF MILITARY DECORATIONS AND AWARDS.

  (1) Former members of the Armed Forces, military units, and veteran
  organizations throughout the United States will be celebrating the 50th
  anniversary of World War II at reunions and other events through 1995.

  II, and groups of former members of the Armed Forces who served together
  in units during World War II have expressed interest in individual and
  unit decorations and awards involving their World War II service that were
  never presented.
  (3) In some cases, the Secretaries of the military departments have declined
  to consider individual and unit decorations and awards involving World War
  II service that were established by administrative action solely because
  of time limitations established administratively on the submission of
  recommendations for the decorations and awards.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that the Secretaries of
  the military departments should consider a recommendation for a decoration
  or award for World War II service without regard to time limitations on
  the consideration of the recommendation if the recommendation--
  (1) is submitted before December 31, 1995;
  (2) involves a decoration or award that is not established by Act of
  Congress; and
  (3) presents new information or evidence that the original recommendation
  was not submitted or was mishandled due to administrative error.

  of such awards.
SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE AWARD OF THE PURPLE HEART TO
MEMBERS KILLED OR WOUNDED IN ACTION BY FRIENDLY FIRE.
  (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The Purple Heart should be awarded to members of the Armed Forces

  and reluctance when considering the award of the Purple Heart to members
  of the Armed Forces killed or wounded by friendly fire while actively
  engaged with the enemy, including engagements during the Persian Gulf War.
  (3) The Congress recognizes that the Secretaries of the military departments
  contend that, as a matter of policy, the Purple Heart has been awarded as
  described in paragraph (1), including during the Persian Gulf War.
  (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress--
  (1) that the Secretaries of the military departments should ensure that
  in the future the Purple Heart is awarded without hesitation to members of
  the Armed Forces killed or wounded by friendly fire while actively engaged
  with the enemy; and
  (2) that the Secretaries of the military departments should award the Purple
  Heart in each case of a member of the Armed Forces killed or wounded on
  or after December 7, 1941, by friendly fire while actively engaged with
  the enemy which is known to the Secretary or for which an application is
  made to the Secretary in such a manner as the Secretary requires.

`SEC. 195. PURPOSE.
  `It is the purpose of this subtitle to authorize the establishment of a
  Civilian Community Corps to provide a basis for determining--
  `(1) whether residential service programs administered by the Federal
  Government can significantly increase the support for national service
  and community service by the people of the United States;
  `(2) whether such programs can expand the opportunities for willing young men
  and women to perform meaningful, direct, and consequential acts of community
  service in a manner that will enhance their own skills while contributing
  to their understanding of civic responsibility in the United States;
  `(3) whether retired members and former members of the Armed Forces of the
  United States, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or
  released from active duty in connection with reduced Department of Defense
  spending, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or
  transferred from the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve in connection

  programs that  contribute meaningfully to the encouragement of national
  and community service; and

SEC. 1301. OVERSEAS BASING ACTIVITIES.
  (a) FUNDING REDUCTIONS- (1)(A) The total amount appropriated to the
  Department of Defense for operation and maintenance and for military
  construction (including NATO Infrastructure) that is obligated to conduct

  amount equal to the baseline for fiscal year 1993 reduced by $500,000,000.
  (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the baseline for fiscal year 1993
  is the sum of the amounts of the overseas funding estimates specified

  Overseas Funding'.
  (2) It is the sense of Congress that the amounts obligated to conduct
  overseas basing activities should decline significantly in fiscal years

  means the activities of the Department of Defense for which funds are
  provided through appropriations for operation and maintenance, including
  appropriations for family housing operations, and for military construction
  (including family housing construction and NATO Infrastructure) for the
  payment of costs for Department of Defense overseas military units and
  the costs for all dependents who accompany Department of Defense personnel
  outside the United States.
  (c) OFFSETS- Reductions for purposes of subsection (a) in obligations of
  appropriated funds for overseas basing activities may be offset by either
  or a combination of the following:
  (1) Increase in the level of host-nation support due to agreements reached
  under subsection (e) or otherwise.
  (2) Accelerated withdrawal of United States forces or equipment under the
  provisions of section 1302 and the amendment made by section 1303.

  in that country or the placement of combat equipment of the United States
  in that country.
  (B) Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to--
  (i) a foreign country that receives assistance under section 23 of the
  Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2673) (relating to the foreign military
  financing program) or under the provisions of chapter 4 of part II of the
  Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.); or

SEC. 1314. REPORT ON POSSIBLE REVISIONS TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) when the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, the clear military
  threat to the security of Western Europe was the Soviet Union and its
  allies in Eastern Europe;
  (2) since 1949 it has been clearly understood by the people of the Western
  World that the primary mission of NATO was to deter an attack from the
  Soviet Bloc;
  (3) the dramatic changes in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in
  1989, and the subsequent dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet
  Union have fundamentally changed the security situation in Europe;
  (4) one of the consequences of the breakdown of 40 years of Communist rule
  in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has been ethnic conflict
  throughout the region, particularly in the Balkans and the Republics of
  the former Soviet Union;
  (5) those fundamental changes in the security threats facing NATO member
  nations have caused confusion concerning the mission of NATO in the post-cold
  war world and the role of NATO military forces outside of the NATO Theater,
  particularly in the former Soviet Union;
  (6) if NATO is to continue to be relevant to the security interests
  of Western Europe and North America through the 1990's and beyond, the
  alliance's mission must be recrafted in order to enable it to address
  common transatlantic security concerns, including those beyond NATO's
  geographic boundaries; and
  (7) a fundamental review of the North Atlantic Treaty is necessary, in
  light of the new security situation in Europe.
  (b) REPORT- Not later than April 1, 1993, the President shall submit to
  Congress a report on the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. The report shall
  include--
  (1) a detailed analysis of the forseeable threats to the security of NATO
  member nations;
  (2) a determination whether the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 should be
  revised to meet the future challenges to peace and security; and
  (3) the extent to which the NATO charter permits the use of NATO forces for
  peacekeeping purposes, given the steadily increased use of military forces
  for such purposes, and the range of missions that should be considered
  for such peacekeeping to protect the interests of member nations
Subtitle C--Matters Relating to the Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
SEC. 1321. NUCLEAR WEAPONS REDUCTION.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) On February 1, 1992, the President of the United States and the President
  of the Russian Federation agreed in a Joint Statement that `Russia and the
  United States do not regard each other as potential adversaries' and stated
  further that, `We will work to remove any remnants of cold war hostility,
  including taking steps to reduce our strategic arsenals'.
  (2) In the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in exchange
  for the non-nuclear-weapon states agreeing not to seek a nuclear weapons
  capability nor to assist other non-nuclear-weapon states in doing so,
  the United States agreed to seek the complete elimination of all nuclear
  weapons worldwide, as declared in the preamble to the Treaty, which states
  that it is a goal of the parties to the Treaty to `facilitate the cessation
  of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing
  stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons
  and the means of their delivery' as well as in Article VI of the Treaty,
  which states that `each of the parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue
  negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation
  of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament'.
  (3) Carrying out a policy of seeking further significant and continuous
  reductions in the nuclear arsenals of all countries, besides reducing
  the likelihood of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasing
  the likelihood of a successful extension and possible strengthening of
  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995, when the
  Treaty is scheduled for review and possible extension, has additional
  benefits to the national security of the United States, including--
  (A) a reduced risk of accidental enablement and launch of a nuclear
  weapon, and
  (B) a defense cost savings which could be reallocated for deficit reduction
  or other important national needs.
  (4) The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) Treaty and the agreement
  by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian
  Federation on June 17, 1992, to reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals of
  each country to a level between 3,000 and 3,500 weapons are commendable
  intermediate stages in the process of achieving the policy goals described
  in paragraphs (1) and (2).
  (5) The current international era of cooperation provides greater
  opportunities for achieving worldwide reduction and control of nuclear
  weapons and material than any time since the emergence of nuclear weapons
  50 years ago.
  (6) It is in the security interests of both the United States and the
  world community for the President and the Congress to begin the process of
  reducing the number of nuclear weapons in every country through multilateral
  agreements and other appropriate means.
  (7) In a 1991 study, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences
  concluded that: `The appropriate new levels of nuclear weapons cannot be
  specified at this time, but it seems reasonable to the committee that
  U.S. strategic forces could in time be reduced to 1,000-2,000 nuclear
  warheads, provided that such a multilateral agreement included appropriate
  levels and verification measures for the other nations that possess nuclear
  weapons. This step would require successful implementation of our proposed
  post-START U.S.-Soviet reductions, related confidence-building measures
  in all the countries involved, and multilateral security cooperation in
  areas such as conventional force deployments and planning.'.
  (b) UNITED STATES POLICY- It shall be the goal of the United States--
  (1) to encourage and facilitate the denuclearization of Ukraine, Byelarus,
  and Kazakhstan, as agreed upon in the Lisbon ministerial meeting of May
  23, 1992;
  (2) to rapidly complete and submit for ratification by the United States
  the treaty incorporating the agreement of June 17, 1992, between the United
  States and the Russian Federation to reduce the number of strategic nuclear
  weapons in each country's arsenal to a level between 3,000 and 3,500;
  (3) to facilitate the ability of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Byelarus,
  and Kazakhstan to implement agreed mutual reductions under the START Treaty,
  and under the Joint Understanding of June 16-17, 1992 between the United
  States and the Russian Federation, on an accelerated timetable, so that
  all such reductions can be completed by the year 2000;
  (4) to build on the agreement reached in the Joint Understanding of June
  16-17, 1992, by entering into multilateral negotiations with the Russian
  Federation, the United Kingdom, France, and the People's Republic of China,
  and, at an appropriate point in that process, enter into negotiations with
  other nuclear armed states in order to reach subsequent stage-by-stage
  agreements to achieve further reductions in the number of nuclear weapons
  in all countries;
  (5) to continue and extend cooperative discussions with the appropriate
  authorities of the former Soviet military on means to maintain and improve
  secure command and control over nuclear forces;
  (6) in consultation with other member countries of the North Atlantic
  Treaty Organization and other allies, to initiate discussions to bring
  tactical nuclear weapons into the arms control process; and
  (7) to ensure that the United States assistance to securely transport and
  store, and ultimately dismantle, former Soviet nuclear weapons and missiles
  for such weapons is being properly and effectively utilized.
  (c) ANNUAL REPORT- By February 1 of each year, the President shall submit
  to the Congress a report on--
  (1) the actions that the United States has taken, and the actions the
  United States plans to take during the next 12 months, to achieve each of
  the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b); and
  (2) the actions that have been taken by the Russian Federation, by other
  former Soviet republics, and by other countries to achieve those goals.
Each such report shall be submitted in unclassified form, with a classified
appendix if necessary.

  the proposals of the Secretary General of the United Nations contained
  in his report to the Security Council entitled `Preventive Diplomacy,
  Peacemaking and Peacekeeping', dated June 19, 1992.
  (b) CONTENT OF PRESIDENT'S REPORT- The President's report shall contain
  a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the proposals of the Secretary
  General, including, in particular, the following:
  (1) The proposal that contributions for peacekeeping and related enforcement
  activities be funded out of the National Defense function of the budget
  rather than the `Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities'
  account of the Department of State.
  (2) The assignment of responsibilities within the Executive branch if
  such contributions are funded, in whole or in part, out of the National
  Defense function.

  United Nations negotiate special agreements under Article 43 of the
  United Nations Charter to provide for those states to make armed forces,
  assistance, and facilities available to the Security Council of the United
  Nations for the purposes stated in Article 42 of that Charter, not only

SEC. 1342. SUPPORT FOR PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) International peacekeeping activities contribute to the national
  interests of the United States in maintaining global stability and order.
  (2) International peacekeeping activities take many forms and include
  observer missions, ceasefire monitoring, human rights monitoring, refugee
  and humanitarian assistance, monitoring and conducting elections, monitoring
  of police in the demobilization of former combatants, and reforming judicial
  and other civil and administrative systems of government.
  (3) International peacekeeping activities traditionally involve the presence
  of military troops, police forces, and, in recent years, civilian experts
  in transportation, logistics, medicine, electoral systems, human rights,
  land tenure, other economic and social issues, and other areas of expertise.
  (4) International peacekeeping activities serve both the foreign policy
  interests and defense policy interests of the United States.
  (5) The normal budget process of authorizing and appropriating funds a
  year in advance and reprogramming such funds is insufficient to satisfy the
  need for funds for peacekeeping efforts arising from an unanticipated crisis.
  (6) Greater flexibility is needed to ensure the timely availability of
  funding to provide for peacekeeping activities.
  (b) AUTHORIZED SUPPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1993- (1) Subject to paragraph

  Department of Defense for fiscal year 1993 for operation and maintenance
  or from balances in working capital accounts.
  (2) No amount may be obligated pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the
  expenditure of such amount has been determined by the Director of the Office
  of Management and Budget to be counted against the defense category of the
  discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 1993 (as defined in section

  international peacekeeping activities, as determined by the President; and
  `(2) only to the extent that such funds are required to meet unexpected
  and urgent requirements; and
  `(3) only to the extent that the United States' fair share of such costs

  programs from which the funds proposed to be obligated are to be derived
  and the amount of the proposed obligation;
  `(2) specify the activities and forms of assistance for which the Secretary
  of Defense plans to obligate such funds; and

  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (1) an estimated 10-20 million mines are scattered across Cambodia,
  Afghanistan, Somalia, Angola, and other countries which have experienced
  conflict; and
  (2) refugee repatriation and other humanitarian programs are being seriously
  hampered by the widespread use of anti-personnel mines in regional conflicts

SEC. 1365. LANDMINE EXPORT MORATORIUM.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) Anti-personnel landmines, which are specifically designed to maim and
  kill people, have been used indiscriminately in dramatically increasing
  numbers, primarily in insurgencies in poor developing countries. Noncombatant
  civilians, including tens of thousands of children, have been the primary
  victims.
  (2) Unlike other military weapons, landmines often remain implanted and
  undiscovered after conflict has ended, causing untold suffering to civilian
  populations. In Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Angola, tens of
  millions of unexploded landmines have rendered whole areas uninhabitable. In
  Afghanistan, an estimated hundreds of thousands of people have been maimed
  and killed by landmines during the 14-year civil war. In Cambodia, more
  than 20,000 civilians have lost limbs and another 60 are being maimed each
  month from landmines.
  (3) Over 35 countries are known to manufacture landmines, including the
  United States. However, the United States is not a major exporter of
  landmines. During the past ten years the Department of State has approved
  ten licenses for the commercial export of anti-personnel landmines valued
  at $980,000, and during the past five years the Department of Defense has
  approved the sale of 13,156 anti-personnel landmines valued at $841,145.
  (4) The United States signed, but has not ratified, the 1981 Convention
  on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons
  Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate
  Effects. The Convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of landmines.
  (5) When it signed the Convention, the United States stated: `We believe that
  the Convention represents a positive step forward in efforts to minimize
  injury or damage to the civilian population in time of armed conflict. Our
  signature of the Convention reflects the general willingness of the United
  States to adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning the conduct
  of military operations, for the purpose of protecting noncombatants.'.
  (6) The President should submit the Convention to the Senate for its advice
  and consent to ratification, and the President should actively negotiate
  under United Nations auspices or other auspices an international agreement,
  or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit the sale, transfer or
  export of anti-personnel landmines. Such an agreement or modification would
  be an appropriate response to the end of the Cold War and the promotion of
  arms control agreements to reduce the indiscriminate killing and maiming
  of civilians.
  (7) The United States should set an example for other countries in such
  negotiations, by implementing a one-year moratorium on the sale, transfer
  or export of anti-personnel landmines.
  (b) STATEMENT OF POLICY- (1) It shall be the policy of the United States to
  seek verifiable international agreements prohibiting the sale, transfer,
  or export, and further limiting the use, production, possession, and
  deployment of anti-personnel landmines.
  (2) It is the sense of the Congress that the President should actively
  seek to negotiate under United Nations auspices or other auspices an
  international agreement, or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit
  the sale, transfer, or export of anti-personnel landmines.

TITLE XVII--CUBAN DEMOCRACY ACT OF 1992
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.
  This title may be cited as the `Cuban Democracy Act of 1992'.
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.
  The Congress makes the following findings:
  (1) The government of Fidel Castro has demonstrated consistent disregard
  for internationally accepted standards of human rights and for democratic
  values. It restricts the Cuban people's exercise of freedom of speech,
  press, assembly, and other rights recognized by the Universal Declaration
  of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
  December 10, 1948. It has refused to admit into Cuba the representative
  of the United Nations Human Rights Commission appointed to investigate
  human rights violations on the island.
  (2) The Cuban people have demonstrated their yearning for freedom and
  their increasing opposition to the Castro government by risking their
  lives in organizing independent, democratic activities on the island and
  by undertaking hazardous flights for freedom to the United States and
  other countries.
  (3) The Castro government maintains a military-dominated economy that
  has decreased the well-being of the Cuban people in order to enable the
  government to engage in military interventions and subversive activities
  throughout the world and, especially, in the Western Hemisphere. These
  have included involvement in narcotics trafficking and support for the
  FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.
  (4) There is no sign that the Castro regime is prepared to make any
  significant concessions to democracy or to undertake any form of democratic
  opening. Efforts to suppress dissent through intimidation, imprisonment,
  and exile have accelerated since the political changes that have occurred
  in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
  (5) Events in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have dramatically
  reduced Cuba's external support and threaten Cuba's food and oil supplies.
  (6) The fall of communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
  the now universal recognition in Latin America and the Caribbean that Cuba
  provides a failed model of government and development, and the evident
  inability of Cuba's economy to survive current trends, provide the United
  States and the international democratic community with an unprecedented
  opportunity to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.
  (7) However, Castro's intransigence increases the likelihood that there
  could be a collapse of the Cuban economy, social upheaval, or widespread
  suffering. The recently concluded Cuban Communist Party Congress has
  underscored Castro's unwillingness to respond positively to increasing
  pressures for reform either from within the party or without.
  (8) The United States cooperated with its European and other allies
  to assist the difficult transitions from Communist regimes in Eastern
  Europe. Therefore, it is appropriate for those allies to cooperate with
  United States policy to promote a peaceful transition in Cuba.
SEC. 1703. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
  It should be the policy of the United States--
  (1) to seek a peaceful transition to democracy and a resumption of economic
  growth in Cuba through the careful application of sanctions directed at
  the Castro government and support for the Cuban people;
  (2) to seek the cooperation of other democratic countries in this policy;
  (3) to make clear to other countries that, in determining its relations
  with them, the United States will take into account their willingness to
  cooperate in such a policy;
  (4) to seek the speedy termination of any remaining military or technical
  assistance, subsidies, or other forms of assistance to the Government of
  Cuba from any of the independent states of the former Soviet Union;
  (5) to continue vigorously to oppose the human rights violations of the
  Castro regime;
  (6) to maintain sanctions on the Castro regime so long as it continues to
  refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights;
  (7) to be prepared to reduce the sanctions in carefully calibrated ways
  in response to positive developments in Cuba;
  (8) to encourage free and fair elections to determine Cuba's political
  future;
  (9) to request the speedy termination of any military or technical
  assistance, subsidies, or other forms of assistance to the Government of
  Cuba from the government of any other country; and
  (10) to initiate immediately the development of a comprehensive United
  States policy toward Cuba in a post-Castro era.

  by the utilities) to address the requirements and circumstances of the
  installation.
  `(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility to
