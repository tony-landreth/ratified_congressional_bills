Whereas substance abuse has reached epidemic proportions and is of major
concern to all Americans;
Whereas substance abuse is a major public health threat and is one of the
major causes of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United
States today;
Whereas illegal drug use is not limited to persons of a particular age,
gender, or socioeconomic status;
Whereas the drug problem appears to be insurmountable, but the United States
has begun to lay the foundation to combat the use of illegal drugs;
Whereas the United States must continue the important strides made to combat
substance abuse;
Whereas it has been demonstrated through public opinion polls that the American
people consider drug abuse one of the most serious domestic problems facing
the United States and have begun to take steps against it;
Whereas the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth has declared
October 24, 1992, through November 1, 1992, as `National Red Ribbon Week',
has organized the National Red Ribbon Campaign to coordinate the week's
activities, has established the theme, `Neighbors--Drug Free and Proud' for
the week, and has called for a comprehensive public awareness, prevention,
and education program involving thousands of parent and community groups
across the country;
Whereas the National Red Ribbon Campaign is headed by President and Mrs. George
Bush and national honorary chairmen;
Whereas any use of an illegal drug is unacceptable and the illegal use of
a legal drug cannot be tolerated; and
Whereas substance abuse destroys lives, spawns crime, undermines our economy,
and threatens our security as a Nation: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled,   That--

  and to develop an attitude of intolerance concerning the use of drugs; and
