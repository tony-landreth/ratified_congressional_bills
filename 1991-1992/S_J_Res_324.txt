Joint Resolution
To commend the NASA Langley Research Center on the celebration of its 75th
anniversary on July 17, 1992.
Whereas, in 1917, the first civilian aeronautical research laboratory of
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was established in
Hampton, Virginia;
Whereas such laboratory, now called the NASA Langley Research Center
(hereafter referred to in this Resolution as the `Center'), occupies 787
acres of government-owned land;
Whereas the official groundbreaking ceremonies for the Center were held on
July 17, 1917;
Whereas the Center is the United States Government's oldest, most prolific
and most honored aerospace laboratory;
Whereas the Center supports the Nation by studying the basic problems of
flight, selecting certain of those problems for investigation, and following
up with practical solutions to such problems through long-term research and
test programs;
Whereas the first United States manned space program, Project Mercury,
began at the Center in 1958;
Whereas the Center supports investigations and research in space technology
and advanced space transportation systems, designs concepts for large space
structures, and develops research hardware and conducts experiments in space;
Whereas the Center makes major contributions to national atmospheric
research such as developing satellite experiments, modeling the atmosphere
and analyzing climate observations;
Whereas from the beginning, people have been the most important resource of
the Center with over 3,000 civil servants and over 2,200 contract personnel
university researchers and United States Army helicopter research personnel
currently working at NASA Langley;
Whereas the Center is comprised of many facilities unique in the world of
aerospace research, five of which have been designated as National Historic
Landmarks by the Department of the Interior; and
Whereas the Center is one of the leading aerospace research laboratories in the
world and has consistently been a source of technology that has made aerospace
a major factor in commerce and national defense: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress does commend the NASA
 Langley Research Center as it celebrates its 75th anniversary on July 17,
 1992, and as it continues expanding the frontiers of flight.
