H.J.Res.133
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Authorizing and requesting the President to designate the second full week
in March
1991 as `National Employ the Older Worker Week'.
Whereas individuals aged 55 and over are a major national resource, constitute
22 percent of the population of the United States at the present time, and are
likely to constitute a larger percentage of the population in future decades;
Whereas a growing number of such individuals, being willing and able to work,
are looking for employment opportunities, want to remain in the workforce,
or would like to serve their communities and their Nation in voluntary roles;
Whereas such individuals, who have made continuing contributions to the
national welfare, should be encouraged to remain in, or resume, career and
voluntary roles that utilize their strengths, wisdom, and skills;
Whereas career opportunities reaffirm the dignity, self-worth, and independence
of older individuals by encouraging them to make decisions and to act upon
those decisions, by tapping their resources, experience, and knowledge,
and by enabling them to contribute to society;
Whereas the operation of title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 has
demonstrated that older workers are extremely capable in a wide variety of
job roles;
Whereas recent studies conducted by the Department of Labor and the Work in
America Institute indicate that, in many cases, employers prefer to retain
older workers or rehire former older employees due to the high quality of
their job performance and their low rate of absenteeism; and
Whereas the American Legion has sponsored a `National Employ the Older
Worker Week' during the second full week of March in every year since 1959,
focusing public attention on the advantages of employing older individuals:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized and
 requested to designate the second full week in March 1991 as `National
 Employ the Older Worker Week', and to issue a proclamation calling upon--
 (1) the employers and labor unions of the United States to give special
 consideration to older workers, with a view toward expanding career and
 employment opportunities for older workers who are willing and able to work
 and who desire to remain employed or to reenter the workforce;
 (2) voluntary organizations to reexamine the many fine service programs
 which they sponsor with a view toward expanding both the number of older
 volunteers and the types of service roles open to older workers;
 (3) the Department of Labor to give special assistance to older workers by
 means of job training programs under the Jobs Training and Partnership Act,
 job counseling through the United States Employment Service, and additional
 support through its Older Worker program, as authorized by title V of the
 Older Americans Act; and
 (4) the citizens of the United States to observe this day with appropriate
 programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
