AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To designate August 15, 1992, as `82d Airborne Division
50th Anniversary Recognition Day'.
Whereas 50 years ago, brave men and women of the United States made tremendous
sacrifices to defend freedom and to save the world from tyranny and aggression
during World War II;
Whereas, during World War II, the American paratrooper became a new type of
fighting soldier;
Whereas, from the drop zones of Sicily and Normandy to the desert sands of
Iraq, the paratroopers of the 82d Airborne Division of the United States
Army have distinguished themselves as being among those who were the first
to answer the call to go in harm's way;
Whereas the 82d Airborne Division is recognized as an elite fighting force
that continues to be on the cutting-edge of our Armed Forces;
Whereas today, as for the past 50 years, the 82d Airborne Division's ranks
are filled with some of our Nation's best soldiers; and
Whereas it is appropriate that we recognize the 82d Airborne Division on the
50th anniversary of its formation and pay tribute to the gallant paratroopers,
past and present, who wear the maroon beret: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That August 15, 1992, is designated as
 `82d Airborne Division 50th Anniversary Recognition Day'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such day with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities acknowledging the many important contributions of the 82d
 Airborne Division of the United States Army over the past 50 years.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
