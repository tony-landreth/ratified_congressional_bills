S.J.Res. 59
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating March 25, 1991, as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of
Celebration of Greek and American Democracy'.
Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the
supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew heavily
upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming
our representative democracy;
Whereas March 25, 1991, marks the one hundred and seventieth anniversary
of the beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from the
Ottoman Empire;
Whereas 1991 marks the 50th anniversary of the historic Battle of Crete of
World War II--one of many wars which have found Greece and the United States
allied in the defense of democracy;
Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond between our two
nations and their peoples; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people, and to
reaffirm the democratic principles from which our two great nations sprang:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1991, is designated as
 `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American
 Democracy,' and that the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe the designated day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
