H.J.Res.411
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of September 13, 1992, through September 19, 1992, as
`National Rehabilitation Week'.
Whereas the designation of a week as `National Rehabilitation Week' gives the
people of this Nation an opportunity to celebrate the victories, courage, and
determination of individuals with disabilities in this Nation and recognize
dedicated health care professionals who work daily to help such individuals
achieve independence;
Whereas there are significant areas where the needs of such individuals with
disabilities have not been met, such as certain research and educational needs;
Whereas half of the people of this Nation will need some form of rehabilitation
therapy;
Whereas rehabilitation agencies and facilities offer care and treatment for
individuals with physical, mental, emotional, and social disabilities;
Whereas the goal of the rehabilitative services offered by such agencies and
facilities is to help disabled individuals lead active lives at the greatest
level of independence possible; and
Whereas the majority of the people of this Nation are not aware of the
limitless possibilities of invaluable rehabilitative services in this Nation:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) the week of September 13, 1992, through September 19, 1992, is designated
 as `National Rehabilitation Week' and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
 States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities,
 including educational activities to heighten public awareness of the types
 of rehabilitative services available in this Nation and the manner in which
 such services improve the quality of life of disabled individuals; and
 (2) each State governor, and each chief executive of each political
 subdivision of each State, is urged to issue a proclamation (or other
 appropriate official statement) calling upon the citizens of such State
 or political subdivision of a State to observe such week in the manner
 described in paragraph (1).
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
