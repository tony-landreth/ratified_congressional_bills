H.J.Res.327
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating 1992 as the `Year of the Gulf of Mexico'.
Whereas the Gulf of Mexico, which is bordered by the United States on 3
sides, is a national treasure deserving of our time, attention, and best
stewardship efforts;
Whereas, although the Gulf of Mexico is a body of water that is of prime
economic importance to the United States and is a recreational retreat for
millions of Americans, there are signs of serious long-term environmental
damage appearing throughout the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of Mexico;
Whereas commercial fishing in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for more than 20
percent of the total commercial fish yield of the United States, and the
Gulf of Mexico currently yields close to twice the amount of shrimp than
all other United States fisheries combined;
Whereas the estuaries, wetlands, and barrier islands of the Gulf of Mexico
provide critical habitat for large populations of finfish, shellfish,
waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial nesting birds, and 75 percent of the migratory
waterfowl traversing the United States;
Whereas the Gulf of Mexico is an economic cornerstone for the States that
border it, in that 90 percent of domestic offshore production of oil and gas
comes from the Gulf of Mexico and close to 50 percent of the United States
shipping tonnage passes through Gulf of Mexico ports;
Whereas it is estimated that tourism-related dollars in States that border the
Gulf of Mexico contribute an estimated $20,000,000,000 to the economy of the
United States, drawing millions of sport fishermen and beach users annually;
Whereas during the past few decades the Gulf of Mexico has begun to show
signs of deteriorating environmental quality, including excess nutrients,
toxic substance and pesticide contamination, and the presence of human
pathogens, which are contributing to the deteriorating water quality and
closed fishing and shellfish areas in the Gulf of Mexico;
Whereas shoreline development, canal and channel dredging, and alterations
of freshwater flow into the Gulf of Mexico estuaries are causing extensive
losses of marshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds, which are critical and highly
productive habitats to a wide variety of estuarine and marine organisms; and
Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to preserve and
enhance the natural and economic resources of the Gulf of Mexico by heightening
awareness of the need for active participation in the protection of the Gulf
of Mexico:  Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) 1992 is designated as the `Year of the Gulf of Mexico';
 (2) all Federal and State agencies which have responsibility for matters
 affecting the Gulf of Mexico should take a responsible role in the cooperative
 effort to increase the awareness of the public regarding the immeasurable
 value of this resource and the current conditions which threaten its
 aesthetic and economic value; and
 (3) the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 recognizing such year and calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such year with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
