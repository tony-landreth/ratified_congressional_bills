AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating November 1992 as `Neurofibromatosis Awareness Month'.
Whereas neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow
in the human nervous system;
Whereas neurofibromatosis is the most common tumor-causing genetic disorder
of the nervous system;
Whereas neurofibromatosis leads to disfigurement, blindness, deafness,
loss of limbs, scoliosis, and brain and spinal tumors;
Whereas neurofibromatosis is a potentially debilitating disorder that strikes
males and females of all races and ethnic groups;
Whereas great strides have been made in neurofibromatosis research with the
discovery of the neurofibromatosis gene and its product and function as well
as the cloning of the NF1 gene;
Whereas the neurofibromatosis gene is known to be a tumor suppressor gene,
research into neurofibromatosis has profound significance for investigations
into the causes of cancer;
Whereas an animal model for NF1 has recently been found;
Whereas a candidate gene for NF2 has also been discovered;
Whereas because the incidence of learning disabilities in the population
of individuals suffering from neurofibromatosis is 5 times greater than in
the general population, progress in neurofibromatosis research is important
to achieving a better understanding of the causes of learning disabilities,
which affect more than 30 million Americans; and
Whereas the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation, Inc., a voluntary health
organization with chapters across the United States, was established to
serve individuals with neuro- fibromatosis and their families, to promote
and support biomedical research on neurofibromatosis, and to increase public
awareness of neurofibromatosis and its consequences: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That November  1992 is designated as
  `Neurofibromatosis Awareness Month'. The President is authorized and
  requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
  States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
