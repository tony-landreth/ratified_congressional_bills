An Act
To develop a national intermodal surface transportation system, to authorize
funds for construction of highways, for highway safety programs, and for
mass transit programs, and for other purposes.
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 This Act may be cited as the `Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
 Act of 1991'.
SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY: INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY
ACT.
 It is the policy of the United States to develop a National Intermodal
 Transportation System that is economically efficient and environmentally
 sound, provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global
 economy, and will move people and goods in an energy efficient manner.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall consist of all forms
 of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner, including the
 transportation systems of the future, to reduce energy consumption and air
 pollution while promoting economic development and supporting the Nation's
 preeminent position in international commerce.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include a National
 Highway System which consists of the National System of Interstate and
 Defense Highways and those principal arterial roads which are essential for
 interstate and regional commerce and travel, national defense, intermodal
 transfer facilities, and international commerce and border crossings.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall include significant
 improvements in public transportation necessary to achieve national goals
 for improved air quality, energy conservation, international competitiveness,
 and mobility for elderly persons, persons with disabilities, and economically
 disadvantaged persons in urban and rural areas of the country.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall provide improved access
 to ports and airports, the Nation's link to world commerce.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall give special emphasis
 to the contributions of the transportation sectors to increased productivity
 growth. Social benefits must be considered with particular attention to the
 external benefits of reduced air pollution, reduced traffic congestion and
 other aspects of the quality of life in the United States.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System must be operated and maintained
 with insistent attention to the concepts of innovation, competition, energy
 efficiency, productivity, growth, and accountability. Practices that resulted
 in the lengthy and overly costly construction of the Interstate and Defense
 Highway System must be confronted and ceased.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System shall be adapted to `intelligent
 vehicles', `magnetic levitation systems', and other new technologies wherever
 feasible and economical, with benefit cost estimates given special emphasis
 concerning safety considerations and techniques for cost allocation.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System, where appropriate, will be
 financed, as regards Federal apportionments and reimbursements, by the
 Highway Trust Fund. Financial assistance will be provided to State and
 local governments and their instrumentalities to help implement national
 goals relating to mobility for elderly persons, persons with disabilities,
 and economically disadvantaged persons.
 The National Intermodal Transportation System must be the centerpiece of a
 national investment commitment to create the new wealth of the Nation for
 the 21st century.
 The Secretary shall distribute copies of this Declaration of Policy to
 each employee of the Department of Transportation and shall ensure that
 such Declaration of Policy is posted in all offices of the Department of
 Transportation.

 population centers, international border crossings, ports, airports, public
 transportation facilities, and other intermodal transportation facilities
 and other major travel destinations; meet national defense requirements;
 and serve interstate and interregional travel.
 `(2) COMPONENTS- The National Highway System shall consist of the following:
 `(A) Highways designated as part of the Interstate System under subsection
 (e) and section 139 of this title.
 `(B) Other urban and rural principal arterials and highways (including toll
 facilities) which provide motor vehicle access between such an arterial and
 a major port, airport, public transportation facility, or other intermodal
 transportation facility. The States, in cooperation with local and regional
 officials, shall propose to the Secretary arterials and highways for
 designation to the National Highway System under this paragraph. In urbanized
 areas, the local officials shall act through the metropolitan planning
 organizations designated for such areas under section 134 of this title. The
 routes on the National Highway System, as shown on the map submitted by the
 Secretary to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House
 of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the
 Senate in 1991, illustrating the National Highway System, shall serve as the
 basis for the States in proposing arterials and highways for designation to
 such system. The Secretary may modify or revise such proposals and submit
 such modified or revised proposals to Congress for approval in accordance
 with paragraph (3).
 `(C) A strategic highway network which is a network of highways which are
 important to the United States strategic defense policy and which provide
 defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for the movement of
 personnel, materiels, and equipment in both peace time and war time. Such
 highways may include highways on and off the Interstate System and shall
 be designated by the Secretary in consultation with appropriate Federal
 agencies and the States and be subject to approval by Congress in accordance
 with paragraph (3).
 `(D) Major strategic highway network connectors which are highways that
 provide motor vehicle access between major military installations and
 highways which are part of the strategic highway network. Such highways shall
 be designated by the Secretary in consultation with appropriate Federal
 agencies and the States and subject to approval by Congress in accordance
 with paragraph (3).

 CORRIDORS- (A) Before making an apportionment of funds under subsection
 (b)(3) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall set aside $5,000,000 of the
 funds authorized to be appropriated for the surface transportation program
 for such fiscal year for elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings
 in not to exceed 5 railway corridors selected by the Secretary in accordance
 with the criteria set forth in this paragraph.
 `(B) A corridor selected by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) must include
 rail lines where railroad speeds of 90 miles per hour are occurring or can
 reasonably be expected to occur in the future.
 `(3) In making the determination required by paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary
 shall consider projected rail ridership volumes in such corridors, the
 percentage of the corridor over which a train will be capable of operating
 at its maximum cruise speed taking into account such factors as topography
 and other traffic on the line, projected benefits to nonriders such as
 congestion relief on other modes of transportation serving the corridors
 (including congestion in heavily traveled air passenger corridors), the amount
 of State and local financial support that can reasonably be anticipated for
 the improvement of the line and related facilities, and the cooperation
 of the owner of the right-of-way that can reasonably be expected in the
 operation of high speed rail passenger service in such corridors.'.

SEC. 1012. TOLL ROADS, BRIDGES, AND TUNNELS.
 (a) NEW PROGRAM- Section 129(a) of title 23, United States Code, is amended
 to read as follows:
 `(a) BASIC PROGRAM-
 `(1) AUTHORIZATION FOR FEDERAL PARTICIPATION- Notwithstanding section 301
 of this title and subject to the provisions of this section, the Secretary
 shall permit Federal participation in--
 `(A) initial construction of a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel (other than
 a highway, bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate System) or approach thereto;
 `(B) reconstructing, resurfacing, restoring, and rehabilitating a toll
 highway, bridge, or tunnel (including a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel
 subject to an agreement entered into under this section or section 119(e)
 as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Intermodal
 Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991) or approach thereto;
 `(C) reconstruction or replacement of a toll-free bridge or tunnel and
 conversion of the bridge or tunnel to a toll facility;
 `(D) reconstruction of a toll-free Federal-aid highway (other than a
 highway on the Interstate System) and conversion of the highway to a toll
 facility; and
 `(E) preliminary studies to determine the feasibility of a toll facility
 for which Federal participation is authorized under subparagraph (A), (B),
 (C), or (D);
on the same basis and in the same manner as in the construction of free
highways under this chapter.
 `(2) OWNERSHIP- Each highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto constructed
 under this subsection must--
 `(A) be publicly owned, or
 `(B) be privately owned if the public authority having jurisdiction over
 the highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach has entered into a contract with
 a private person or persons to design, finance, construct, and operate the
 facility and the public authority will be responsible for complying with
 all applicable requirements of this title with respect to the facility.
 `(3) LIMITATIONS ON USE OF REVENUES- Before the Secretary may permit Federal
 participation under this subsection in construction of a highway, bridge,
 or tunnel located in a State, the public authority (including the State
 transportation department) having jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, or
 tunnel must enter into an agreement with the Secretary which provides that all
 toll revenues received from operation of the toll facility will be used first
 for debt service, for reasonable return on investment of any private person
 financing the project, and for the costs necessary for the proper operation
 and maintenance of the toll facility, including reconstruction, resurfacing,
 restoration, and rehabilitation. If the State certifies annually that the
 tolled facility is being adequately maintained, the State may use any toll
 revenues in excess of amounts required under the preceding sentence for any
 purpose for which Federal funds may be obligated by a State under this title.
 `(4) SPECIAL RULE FOR FUNDING- In the case of a toll highway, bridge,
 or tunnel under the jurisdiction of a public authority of a State (other
 than the State transportation department), upon request of the State
 transportation department and subject to such terms and conditions as such
 department and public authority may agree, the Secretary shall reimburse
 such public authority for the Federal share of the costs of construction of
 the project carried out on the toll facility under this subsection in the
 same manner and to the same extent as such department would be reimbursed if
 such project was being carried out by such department. The reimbursement of
 funds under this paragraph shall be from sums apportioned to the State under
 this chapter and available for obligations on projects on the Federal-aid
 system in such State on which the project is being carried out.
 `(5) LIMITATION ON FEDERAL SHARE- Except as otherwise provided in this
 paragraph, the Federal share payable for construction of a highway, bridge,
 tunnel, or approach thereto or conversion of a highway, bridge, or tunnel
 to a toll facility under this subsection shall be such percentage as
 the State determines but not to exceed 50 percent. The Federal share
 payable for construction of a new bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto
 or for reconstruction or replacement of a bridge, tunnel, or approach
 thereto shall be such percentage as the Secretary determines but not to
 exceed 80 percent. In the case of a toll facility subject to an agreement
 under section 119 or 129, the Federal share payable on any project for
 resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, or reconstructing such facility
 shall be 80 percent until the scheduled expiration of such agreement (as
 in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Intermodal
 Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991).
 `(6) MODIFICATIONS- If a public authority (including a State transportation
 department) having jurisdiction over a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel
 subject to an agreement under this section or section 119(e), as in
 effect on the day before the effective date of title I of the Intermodal
 Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, requests modification of such
 agreement, the Secretary shall modify such agreement to allow the continuation
 of tolls in accordance with paragraph (3) without repayment of Federal funds.
 `(7) LOANS- A State may loan all or part of the Federal share of a toll
 project under this section to a public or private agency constructing a
 toll facility. Such loan may be made only after all Federal environmental
 requirements have been complied with and permits obtained. The amount
 loaned shall be subordinated to other debt financing for the facility
 except for loans made by the State or any other public agency to the agency
 constructing the facility. Funds loaned pursuant to this section may be
 obligated for projects eligible under this section. The repayment of any
 such loan shall commence not more than 5 years after the facility has
 opened to traffic. Any such loan shall bear interest at the average rate
 the State's pooled investment fund earned in the 52 weeks preceding the
 start of repayment. The term of any such loan shall not exceed 30 years
 from the time the loan was obligated. Amounts repaid to a State from any
 loan made under this section may be obligated for any purpose for which
 the loaned funds were available. The Secretary shall establish procedures
 and guidelines for making such loans.
 `(8) INITIAL CONSTRUCTION DEFINED- For purposes of this subsection, the
 term `initial construction' means the construction of a highway, bridge,
 or tunnel at any time before it is open to traffic and does not include
 any improvement to a highway, bridge, or tunnel after it is open to traffic.'.
 (b) CONGESTION PRICING PILOT PROGRAM- (1) The Secretary shall solicit the
 participation of State and local governments and public authorities for
 one or more congestion pricing pilot projects. The Secretary may enter into
 cooperative agreements with as many as 5 such State or local governments or
 public authorities to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing
 projects.
 (2) Notwithstanding section 129 of title 23, United States Code, the Federal
 share payable for such programs shall be 80 percent. The Secretary shall
 fund all of the development and other start up costs of such projects,
 including salaries and expenses, for a period of at least 1 year, and
 thereafter until such time that sufficient revenues are being generated
 by the program to fund its operating costs without Federal participation,
 except that the Secretary may not fund any project for more than 3 years.
 (3) Revenues generated by any pilot project under this subsection must be
 applied to projects eligible under such title.
 (4) Notwithstanding sections 129 and 301 of title 23, United States Code,
 the Secretary shall allow the use of tolls on the Interstate System as part of
 a pilot program under this section, but not on more than 3 of such programs.
 (5) The Secretary shall monitor the effect of such projects for a period of at
 least 10 years, and shall report to the Committee on Environment and Public
 Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of
 the House of Representatives every 2 years on the effects such programs are
 having on driver behavior, traffic, volume, transit ridership, air quality,
 and availability of funds for transportation programs.
 (6) Of the sums made available to the Secretary pursuant to section
 104(a) of title 23, United States Code, not to exceed $25,000,000 shall
 be made available each fiscal year to carry out the requirements of this
 subsection. Not more than $15,000,000 of such amounts shall be made available
 to carry out each pilot project under this section.
 (c) ELIMINATION OF PUBLIC OPERATION REQUIREMENT FOR TOLL FERRIES- Section
 129 of such title is amended--
 (1) by striking subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (i), and (k);
 (2) by redesignating subsections (f), (g), and (j) as subsections (b),
 (c), and (d), respectively;
 (3) in subsection (c) as so redesignated by inserting `and ferry terminal
 facilities' after `boats';
 (4) in subsection (c) as so redesignated by striking paragraph (3) and
 inserting the following:
 `(3) Such ferry boat or ferry terminal facility shall be publicly owned.'; and
 (5) in subsection (c)(4) as so redesignated--
 (A) by inserting `or other public entity' after `State'; and
 (B) by inserting before the period at the end the following: `, debt service,
 negotiated management fees, and, in the case of a privately operated toll
 ferry, for a reasonable rate of return'.
 (d) CONTINUATION OF EXISTING AGREEMENTS- Unless modified under section
 129(a)(6) of such title, as amended by subsection (a) of this section,
 agreements entered into under section 119(e) or 129 of such title before the
 effective date of this title and in effect on the day before such effective
 date shall continue in effect on and after such effective date in accordance
 with the provisions of such agreement and such section 119(e) or 129.
 (e) SPECIAL RULE FOR CERTAIN EXISTING TOLL FACILITY AGREEMENTS-
 Notwithstanding sections 119 and 129 of title 23, United States Code, at
 the request of the non-Federal parties to a toll facility agreement reached
 before October 1, 1991, regarding the New York State Thruway or the Fort
 McHenry Tunnel under section 105 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 or
 section 129 of title 23, United States Code (as in effect on the day before
 the date of the enactment of this Act), the Secretary shall allow for the
 continuance of tolls without repayment of Federal funds. Revenues collected
 from such tolls, after the date of such request, in excess of revenues needed
 for debt service and the actual costs of operation and maintenance shall be
 available for (1) any transportation project eligible for assistance under
 title 23, United States Code, or (2) costs associated with transportation
 facilities under the jurisdiction of such non-Federal party, including debt
 service and costs related to the construction, reconstruction, restoration,
 repair, operation and maintenance of such facilities.
 (f) VOIDING OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR I-78 DELAWARE RIVER BRIDGE- Upon
 the joint request of the State of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey,
 and the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, and upon such parties
 entering into a new agreement with the Secretary regarding the bridge on
 Interstate Route 78 which crosses the Delaware River in the vicinity of
 Easton, Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, New Jersey, the Secretary shall
 void any agreement entered into with such parties with respect to the bridge
 before the effective date of this subsection under section 129(a), 129(d),
 or 129(e) of title 23, United States Code. The new agreement referred to
 in the preceding sentence shall permit the continuation of tolls without
 repayment of Federal funds and shall provide that all toll revenues received
 from operation of the bridge will be used--
 (1) first for repayment of the non-Federal cost of construction of the bridge
 (including debt service);
 (2) second for the costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance
 of the bridge, including resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation; and
 (3) to the extent that toll revenues exceed the amount necessary for
 paragraphs (1) and (2), such excess may be used with respect to any other
 bridge under the jurisdiction of the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge
 Commission.

 on and after September 1, 1997. Subject to the provisions of subsection
 (c), the percentage prescribed for passenger cars manufactured on and after
 September 1, 1997, shall be met entirely by inflatable restraints (accompanied
 by lap and shoulder belts) for both front outboard seating positions.
 (2) NEW TRUCKS, BUSES, AND MULTIPURPOSE PASSENGER VEHICLES- The amendment
 shall take effect for 80 percent of each manufacturer's annual production of
 trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles described in subsection
 (a)(1)(A) and manufactured on and after September 1, 1997, and before
 September 1, 1998, and for 100 percent of each manufacturer's production
 of such trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles manufactured
 on and after September 1, 1998. Subject to the provisions of subsection
 (c), the percentage prescribed for such trucks, buses, and multipurpose
 passenger vehicles manufactured on and after September 1, 1998, shall be met
 entirely by inflatable restraints (accompanied by lap and shoulder belts) for
 both front outboard seating positions. The incentives or credits available
 under Standard 208 (as amended by this section) prior to September 1, 1998,
 shall not be available to the manufacturers to comply with the 100 percent
 requirement of this paragraph on and after such date.
 (c) TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FROM REQUIREMENTS- Upon application by a manufacturer,
 in such manner and containing such information as the Secretary shall
 prescribe in the amendment under this section to such Standard 208, the
 Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions and to such
 extent as the Secretary deems appropriate, temporarily exempt or renew
 the exemption of a motor vehicle from the requirements of subsection (a)
 or (b), or both, if the Secretary finds that there has been a disruption
 in the supply of any inflatable restraint component, or a disruption in
 the use and installation by the manufacturer of such component due to
 unavoidable events not under the control of the manufacturer, that will
 prevent a manufacturer from meeting its anticipated production volume of
 vehicles with such restraints. Each application for such exemption must be
 filed by the manufacturer affected, and must specify the models, lines, and
 types of vehicles actually affected, although the Secretary may consolidate
 applications of a similar nature of 1 or more manufacturers. Any exemption
 or renewal shall be conditioned upon the manufacturer's commitment to recall
 the exempted vehicles for installation of omitted inflatable restraints
 within a reasonable time proposed by the manufacturer and approved by the
 Secretary after such components become available in sufficient quantities to
 satisfy both anticipated production and recall volume requirements. Notice
 of each application shall be published in the Federal Register and notice
 of each decision to grant or deny a temporary exemption, and the reasons
 for granting or denying it, shall be published in the Federal Register. The
 Secretary shall require labeling for each exempted motor vehicle which can
 only be removed after recall and installation of the required inflatable
 restraint. If a vehicle is delivered without an inflatable restraint,
 the Secretary shall require that written notification of the exemption
 be delivered to the dealer and first purchasers for purposes other than
 resale of such exempted motor vehicle in such a manner, and containing such
 information, as the Secretary deems appropriate.
 (d) CONSTRUCTION- Nothing in this section shall be construed by the Secretary
 or any other person, including any court, as altering or affecting any
 other provision of law administered by the Secretary and applicable to such
 passenger cars or trucks, buses, or multipurpose passenger vehicles or as
 establishing any precedent regarding the development and promulgation of
 any Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. Nothing in this section or in the
 amendments made under this section to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
 208 shall be construed by any person or court as indicating an intention
 by Congress to affect, change, or modify in any way the liability, if any,
 of a motor vehicle manufacturer under applicable law relative to vehicles
 with or without inflatable restraints.
 (e) REPORT- The Secretary shall biannually report, beginning October 1,
 1992 and continuing to October 1, 2000, on the actual effectiveness of an
 occupant restraint system defined as the percentage reduction in fatalities
 or injuries of restrained occupants as compared to unrestrained occupants
 for the combination of inflated restraints and lap and shoulder belts,
 for inflated restraints alone, and for lap and shoulder belts alone. The
 Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of
 Defense, shall also provide data and analysis on lap and shoulder belt use,
 nationally and in each State, by Federal, State, and local law enforcement
 officers, by military personnel, by Federal and State employees other than
 law enforcement officers, and by the public.
 (f) AIRBAGS FOR CARS ACQUIRED FOR FEDERAL USE- The Secretary, in cooperation
 with the Administrator of General Services and the heads of other appropriate
 Federal agencies and consistent with applicable provisions of Federal
 procurement law and available appropriations, shall establish a program
 requiring that all passenger cars acquired after September 30, 1994, for use
 by the Federal Government be equipped, to the maximum extent practicable,
 with driver-side inflatable restraints and that all passenger cars acquired
 after September 30, 1996, for use by the Federal Government be equipped,
 to the maximum extent practicable, with inflatable restraints for both the
 driver and front seat outboard seating positions.

SEC. 3012. METROPOLITAN PLANNING.
 The Act is amended by striking section 8 and inserting the following new
 section:
`SEC. 8. METROPOLITAN PLANNING.
 `(a) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS- It is in the national interest to encourage and
 promote the development of transportation systems embracing various modes
 of transportation in a manner which will efficiently maximize mobility
 of people and goods within and through urbanized areas and minimize
 transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution. To accomplish
 this objective, metropolitan planning organizations, in cooperation with the
 State, shall develop transportation plans and programs for urbanized areas
 of the State. Such plans and programs shall provide for the development
 of transportation facilities (including pedestrian walkways and bicycle
 transportation facilities) which will function as an intermodal transportation
 system for the State, the metropolitan areas, and the Nation. The process
 for developing such plans and programs shall provide for consideration
 of all modes of transportation and shall be continuing, cooperative, and
 comprehensive to the degree appropriate, based on the complexity of the
 transportation problems.
 `(b) DESIGNATION OF METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- To carry out the transportation planning process required
 by this section, a metropolitan planning organization shall be designated
 for each urbanized area of more than 50,000 population by agreement among
 the Governor and units of general purpose local government which together
 represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the
 central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census) or in
 accordance with procedures established by applicable State or local law.
 `(2) MEMBERSHIP OF CERTAIN MPO'S- In a metropolitan area designated as
 a transportation management area, the metropolitan planning organization
 designated for such area shall include local elected officials, officials
 of agencies which administer or operate major modes of transportation in
 the metropolitan area (including all transportation agencies included in
 the metropolitan planning organization on June 1, 1991) and appropriate
 State officials. This paragraph shall only apply to a metropolitan planning
 organization which is redesignated after the date of the enactment of
 this section.

 organizations, whether made under this section or other provisions of law,
 shall remain in effect until redesignated under paragraph (5) or revoked by
 agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government
 which together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population or
 as otherwise provided under State or local procedures.
 `(5) REDESIGNATION-
 `(A) PROCEDURES- A metropolitan planning organization may be redesignated by
 agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government
 which together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population
 (including the central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census)
 as appropriate to carry out this section.
 `(B) CERTAIN REQUESTS TO REDESIGNATE- A metropolitan planning organization
 shall be redesignated upon request of a unit or units of general purpose
 local government representing at least 25 percent of the affected population
 (including the central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census)
 in any urbanized area (i) whose population is more than 5,000,000 but less
 than 10,000,000, or (ii) which is an extreme nonattainment area for ozone
 or carbon monoxide as defined under the Clean Air Act. Such redesignation
 shall be accomplished using procedures established by subparagraph (A).
 `(6) TREATMENT OF LARGE URBAN AREAS- More than 1 metropolitan planning
 organization may be designated within an urbanized area as defined by
 the Bureau of the Census only if the Governor determines that the size and
 complexity of the urbanized area make designation of more than 1 metropolitan
 planning organization for such area appropriate.
 `(c) METROPOLITAN AREA BOUNDARIES- For the purposes of this section, the
 boundaries of a metropolitan area shall be determined by agreement between
 the metropolitan planning organization and the Governor. Each metropolitan
 area shall cover at least the existing urbanized area and the contiguous
 area expected to become urbanized within the 20-year forecast period and
 may encompass the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area or Consolidated
 Metropolitan Statistical Area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. For
 areas designated as nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide under
