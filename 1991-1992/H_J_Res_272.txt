One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To proclaim March 20, 1992, as `National Agriculture Day'.
Whereas agriculture is the Nation's largest and most basic industry, and its
associated production, processing, and marketing segments together provide
more jobs than any other single industry;
Whereas the United States agricultural sector serves all Americans by
providing food, fiber, and other basic necessities of life;
Whereas the performance of the agricultural economy is vital to maintaining
the strength of our national economy, the standard of living of our citizens,
and our presence in world trade markets;
Whereas the Nation's heritage of family-owned and family-operated farms and
ranches has been the core of the American agricultural system and continues
to be the best means for assuring the protection of our natural resources
and the production of an adequate and affordable supply of food and fiber
for future generations of Americans;
Whereas the American agricultural system provides American consumers with
a stable supply of the highest quality food and fiber for the lowest cost
per capita in the world;
Whereas American agriculture continually seeks to maintain and improve the
high level of product quality and safety expected by the consumer;
Whereas the public should be aware of the contributions of all people--men
and women--who are a part of American agriculture and its contributions to
American life, health, and prosperity;
Whereas women play a vital role in maintaining the family farm system, both
as sole operators and as working partners, and are also attaining important
leadership roles throughout the American agricultural system;
Whereas farmworkers are an indispensable part of the agricultural system as
witnessed by their hard work and dedication;
Whereas scientists and researchers play an integral part in the agricultural
system in their search for better and more efficient ways to produce and
process safe and nutritious agricultural products;
Whereas farmers and food processors are responding to the desire of
health-conscious American consumers by developing more health-oriented
food products;
Whereas distributors play an important role in transporting agricultural
products to retailers who in turn make the products available to the consumer;
Whereas our youth--the future of our Nation--have become involved through
various organizations in increasing their understanding and our understanding
of the importance of agriculture in today's society;
Whereas it is important that all Americans should understand the role that
agriculture plays in their lives and well-being, whether they live in urban
or rural areas; and
Whereas since 1973, the first day of spring has been celebrated as National
Agriculture Day by farmers and ranchers, commodity and farm organizations,
cooperatives and agribusiness organizations, nonprofit and community
organizations, other persons involved in the agricultural system, and Federal,
State, and local governments: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That March 20, 1992, is proclaimed `National
 Agriculture Day', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe this
 day with appropriate ceremonies and activities during the week of March 15
 through March 21.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
