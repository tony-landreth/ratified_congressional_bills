H.J.Res.546
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating February 4, 1993, and February 3, 1994, as `National Women and
Girls in Sports Day'.
Whereas women's athletics is one of the most effective avenues available
for women of the United States to develop self-discipline, initiative,
confidence, and leadership skills;
Whereas sports and fitness activities contribute to emotional and physical
well-being;
Whereas women need strong bodies as well as strong minds;
Whereas the history of women in sports is rich and long, but there has
been little national recognition of the significance of women's athletic
achievements;
Whereas the number of women in leadership positions as coaches, officials,
and administrators has declined drastically since the passage of title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972;
Whereas there is a need to restore women to leadership positions in athletics
to ensure a fair representation of the abilities of women and to provide
role models for young female athletes;
Whereas the bonds built between women through athletics help to break down
the social barriers of racism and prejudice;
Whereas the communication and cooperation skills learned through athletic
experience play a key role in the contributions of an athlete at home,
at work, and to society;
Whereas women's athletics has produced such winners as Flo Hyman, whose
spirit, talent, and accomplishments distinguished her above others and
exhibited the true meaning of fairness, determination, and team play;
Whereas parents feel that sports are equally important for boys and girls
and that sports and fitness activities provide important benefits to girls
who participate;
Whereas early motor skill training and enjoyable experiences of physical
activity strongly influence lifelong habits of physical fitness;
Whereas the performances of female athletes in the Olympic games are a source
of inspiration and pride to the United States;
Whereas the athletic opportunities for male students at the collegiate and high
school levels remain significantly greater than those for female students; and
Whereas the number of funded research projects focusing on the specific needs
of women athletes is limited and the information provided by the projects
is imperative to the health and performance of future women athletes: Now,
therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That--
  (1) February 4, 1993, and February 3, 1994, are designated as `National
  Women and Girls in Sports Day'; and
  (2) the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
  calling on local and State jurisdictions, appropriate Federal agencies,
  and the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate
  ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
