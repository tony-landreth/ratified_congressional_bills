H.J.Res.91
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating June 10 through 16, 1991, as `Pediatric AIDS Awareness Week'.
Whereas more than 157,525 individuals in the United States have been diagnosed
with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (commonly known as AIDS) and 98,530
have died from the disease;
Whereas the Public Health Service has estimated that there will be 365,000
cases of AIDS by the end of 1992 and that there are currently between
1,000,000 and 1,500,000 persons in the United States infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV) which causes AIDS;
Whereas heterosexual AIDS is not a myth as evidenced by the fact that the
proportion of females with AIDS continues to rise, as does the number of
pediatric AIDS cases of children infected perinatally;
Whereas pediatric AIDS refers to AIDS patients under the age of 13 at the
time of being diagnosed with the disease;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control has reported 2,734 cases of pediatric
AIDS resulting in 1,423 deaths as of November 1990;
Whereas approximately 75 percent of teenagers in the United States have had
sexual intercourse by the age of 19;
Whereas among the 25,000,000 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 there
are subgroups who either have intercourse at an earlier age or whose patterns
of sexual behavior put them at risk of becoming infected with HIV;
Whereas HIV-infected women can transmit the virus to their infants during
pregnancy or at birth;
Whereas more than 80 percent of children with AIDS have a parent with,
or at risk for, HIV infection;
Whereas 27 percent of reported pediatric AIDS cases in the United States
have occurred in New York City and 74 percent of those are related to drug
use by a parent or unprotected sexual activity;
Whereas 70 percent of women who are HIV-infected and 78 percent of children
with pediatric AIDS are African-American or Latino, many of whom have
experienced social and economic discrimination;
Whereas there have been 157 cases of pediatric AIDS reported to the Centers
for Disease Control in Miami, Florida; 123 cases in Newark, New Jersey; 106
cases in San Juan, Puerto Rico; 90 cases in Los Angeles, California; 64 cases
in Washington, District of Columbia; 53 cases in West Palm Beach, Florida;
53 cases in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 51 cases in Boston, Massachusetts;
50 cases in Chicago, Illinois; 49 cases in Baltimore, Maryland; and 45 cases
in Houston, Texas;
Whereas schools across the Nation continue to discriminate against AIDS and
HIV-infected children and their families;
Whereas there are increasing numbers of HIV-infected children and it is
important that the people of the United States diligently seek preventative
measures and better solutions to care for HIV-infected pregnant women,
including helping them gain access to new delaying and preventative therapies
to allow time for biomedical progress;
Whereas early intervention and educational resources must be made available to
all citizens, especially adolescents, women who are drug abusers, and other
high-risk groups to make them more aware of AIDS and the risks associated
with engaging in unprotected sexual activity;
Whereas the Health Care Financing Administration and the Public Health
Service should work with appropriate State officials to help design optimal
care packages needed for children with AIDS or HIV infection; and
Whereas States and localities should recognize relatives as an appropriate
source of foster care for children with AIDS whose parents can no longer
care for them, subject to the same review and afforded the same benefits as
other foster parents: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That June 10 through 16, 1991, is designated
 as `Pediatric AIDS Awareness Week', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
