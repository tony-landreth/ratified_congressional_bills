TITLE V--OMNIBUS TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYEE TESTING
SHORT TITLE
 SEC. 1. This title may be cited as the `Omnibus Transportation Employee
 Testing Act of 1991'.
FINDINGS
 SEC. 2. The Congress finds that--
 (1) alcohol abuse and illegal drug use pose significant dangers to the
 safety and welfare of the Nation;
 (2) millions of the Nation's citizens utilize transportation by aircraft,
 railroads, trucks, and buses, and depend on the operators of aircraft,
 trains, trucks, and buses to perform in a safe and responsible manner;
 (3) the greatest efforts must be expended to eliminate the abuse of alcohol
 and use of illegal drugs, whether on duty or off duty, by those individuals
 who are involved in the operation of aircraft, trains, trucks, and buses;
 (4) the use of alcohol and illegal drugs has been demonstrated to affect
 significantly the performance of individuals, and has been proven to have
 been a critical factor in transportation accidents;
 (5) the testing of uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces has shown that
 the most effective deterrent to abuse of alcohol and use of illegal drugs
 is increased testing, including random testing;
 (6) adequate safeguards can be implemented to ensure that testing for abuse
 of alcohol or use of illegal drugs is performed in a manner which protects an
 individual's right of privacy, ensures that no individual is harassed by being
 treated differently from other individuals, and ensures that no individual's
 reputation or career development is unduly threatened or harmed; and
 (7) rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program for
 abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, and should be made available to
 individuals, as appropriate.

 such employees for such use in violation of law or Federal regulation.
 `(2) PROGRAM FOR FAA EMPLOYEES- The Administrator shall establish a program
 applicable to employees of the Federal Aviation Administration whose duties
 include responsibility for safety-sensitive functions.  Such program shall
 provide for preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident
 testing for use, in violation of law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or
 a controlled substance.  The Administrator may also prescribe regulations,

 in the presence of the tested individual and that a portion thereof be
 retained in a secure manner to prevent the possibility of tampering, so
 that in the event the individual's confirmation test results are positive
