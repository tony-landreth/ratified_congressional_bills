S.J.Res.127
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of May 1991, as `National Huntington's Disease Awareness
Month'.
Whereas 25,000 Americans are victims of Huntington's Disease, a fatal,
hereditary, neurological disorder;
Whereas an additional 125,000 Americans have a 50 percent chance of inheriting
the gene responsible for Huntington's Disease from an affected parent,
and are considered to be `at-risk' for the disease;
Whereas tens of thousands of other Americans experience the destructive
effects of the disease, including suffering from the social stigma associated
with the disease, assuming the difficult role of caring for a loved victim
of the disease, witnessing the prolonged, irreversible physical and mental
deterioration of a loved one, and agonizing over the death of a loved one;
Whereas at present there is no cure for Huntington's Disease and no means
available to retard or reverse the effects of the disease;
Whereas a victim of the later stages of Huntington's Disease invariably
requires total personal care, the provision of which often results in
devastating financial consequences for the victim and the victim's family;
Whereas recent advances in the field of molecular genetics have enabled
scientists to locate approximately the gene-site responsible for Huntington's
Disease;
Whereas many of the novel techniques resulting from these advances have
also been instrumental in locating the gene-sites responsible for familial
Alzheimer's Disease, manic depression, kidney cancer and other disorders;
Whereas increased Federal funding of medical research could facilitate
additional advances and result in the discovery of the cause and chemical
processes of Huntington's Disease and the development of strategies to stop
and reverse the progress of the disease;
Whereas Huntington's Disease typifies other late-onset, behavioral genetic
disorders by presenting the victim and the victim's family with a broad
range of biomedical, psychological, social, and economic problems; and
Whereas in the absence of a cure for Huntington's Disease, victims of the
disease deserve to live with dignity and be regarded as full and respected
family members and members of society: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of May 1991, is designated
 as `National Huntington's Disease Awareness Month', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the
 United States to observe such month with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Passed the Senate May 8 (legislative day, April 25), 1991.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
