One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning April 12, 1992, as `National Public Safety
Telecommunicators Week'.
Whereas over one-half million dedicated men and women are engaged in the
operation of emergency response systems for Federal, State, and local
governmental entities throughout the United States;
Whereas these individuals are responsible for responding to the telephone
calls of the general public for police, fire, and emergency medical assistance
and for dispatching said assistance to help save the lives and property of
our citizens;
Whereas such calls include not only police, fire, and emergency medical
service calls but those governmental communications related to forestry and
conservation operations, highway safety and maintenance activities, and all
of the other operations which the modern governmental agency must conduct; and
Whereas America's public safety telecommunicators daily serve the public in
countless ways without due recognition by the beneficiaries of their services:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning April 12, 1992,
 is designated as `National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week', and the
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the
 people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
