One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate 1992 as the `Year of Reconciliation Between American Indians and
non-Indians'.
Whereas 1992 will be recognized as the quincentennial anniversary of the
arrival of Christopher Columbus to this continent;
Whereas this 500th anniversary offers an opportunity for the United States
to honor the indigenous peoples of this continent;
Whereas strife between American Indian and non-Indian cultures is of grave
concern to the people of the United States;
Whereas in the past, improvement in cultural understanding has been achieved
by individuals who have striven to understand the differences between cultures
and to educate others;
Whereas a national effort to develop trust and respect between American Indians
and non-Indians must include participation from the private and public sectors,
churches and church associations, the Federal Government, Tribal governments
and State governments, individuals, communities, and community organizations;
Whereas mutual trust and respect provides a sound basis for constructive
change, given a shared commitment to achieving the goals of equal opportunity,
social justice and economic prosperity; and
Whereas the celebration of our cultural differences can lead to a new respect
for American Indians and their culture among non-Indians: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That 1992 is designated as the `Year of
 Reconciliation Between American Indians and non-Indians'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States, both Indian and non-Indian, to lay aside fears and
 mistrust of one another, to build friendships, to join together and take
 part in shared cultural activities, and to strive towards mutual respect
 and understanding.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
