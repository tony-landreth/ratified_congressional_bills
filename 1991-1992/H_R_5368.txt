  environmental impact assessment. On March 1, 1993 and March 1, 1994, the
  Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress describing
  in detail the progress being made by the MDBs in meeting these benchmarks.
  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), benchmarks are as follows:
  (A) In the area of sustainable energy development--
  (i) all loans in the energy sector should be based on, or support development
  of, `least-cost' integrated resource plans. Such plans shall include analyses
  of possible end-use energy efficiency measures and nonconventional renewable
  energy options, and such plans shall reflect the quantifiable environmental
  costs of proposed energy developments;
  (ii) a substantial portion of loans and grants in the energy, industry,
  and transportation sectors shall be devoted to end-use energy efficiency
  improvements and nonconventional renewable energy development; and
  (iii) all organizational units within the MDBs should create staff positions
  in a management role in end-use efficiency and renewable energy, which
  positions shall be staffed by individuals with professional experience
  in program design and management and educational degrees in relevant
  technical disciplines.
  (B) In the area of forest conservation--
  (i) forestry loans should not support commercial logging in relatively
  undisturbed primary forests, nor should loans result in any significant
  loss of tropical forests;
  (ii) forestry loans should not be disbursed until legal, economic, land
  tenure, and other policy conditions needed to ensure sustainability are
  in place;
  (iii) loans should not support mineral, petroleum, or other industrial
  development in, or construction or upgrading of roads through, relatively
  undisturbed primary forests unless adequate safeguards and monitoring
  systems, developed in consultation with local populations, are already in
  place to prevent degradation of the surrounding forests;
  (iv) loans should be consistent with and support the needs and rights of
  indigenous peoples and other long-term forest inhabitants and should not
  be made to countries which have shown an unwillingness to resolve fairly
  the territorial claims of such people; and
  (v) support for protection of biological diversity, in close consultation
  with local communities, should be increased to account for a larger
  proportion of MDB lending.
  (C) In the area of forced displacement of populations--
  (i) the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asian Development
  Bank should maintain a listing, available to the Secretary of the Treasury,
  of all ongoing projects involving forced displacement of populations,
  including the number of people displaced and a report on the status of
  the implementation of their resettlement policy guidelines for each such
  project, and obtain agreements with borrowers to ensure that all ongoing
  projects involving forced displacement will be in full compliance with
  their resettlement policy guidelines by mid-1993; and
  (ii) the African Development Bank should adopt and implement policy
  guidelines on forced displacement similar to such guidelines of the
  other MDBs.
  (D) In the area of procedures for environmental impact assessment (EIA)--
  (i) each MDB should require that draft and final EIA reports be made
  available to the public in borrowing and donor countries and that the public
  be offered timely opportunities for comment on the EIA process, including
  initial scoping sessions, review of EIA categories assigned to individual
  projects, and opportunities to comment on draft and final EIA reports;
  (ii) each MDB should apply EIA requirements to all sector loans and develop
  and apply the methodology for environmental assessment of structural
  adjustment loans;
  (iii) each MDB should require that the EIA process include analyses of
  the potential impacts of proposed projects on the global environment; and
  (iv) each MDB should require the head of the appropriate environmental
  unit, rather than project officers, determine the appropriate type of
  environmental analysis required under the bank's EIA procedures.
  (d) The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall
  instruct all Agency missions and bureaus to continue to implement all
  elements of the `Global Warming Initiative' as defined in, and which
  may continue under, the authorities of sections 533(c) (1) through (4)
  of Public Law 101-513. The Initiative shall continue to emphasize the need
  to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases through strategies consistent with
  continued economic development, such as forest conservation, end-use energy
  efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy development. The
  Administrator shall direct Agency mission directors to incorporate these
  strategies in their country programs.

  Act to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (including title IV of
  chapter 2 of part I, relating to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation)
  or the Arms Export Control Act may be used to provide assistance to Jordan

NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION POLICY IN SOUTH ASIA
  SEC. 585. (a) The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended by inserting
  the following new section:
`SEC. 620F. NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION POLICY IN SOUTH ASIA.
  `(a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  `(1) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the
  most serious threats to international peace and stability;
  `(2) South Asia, in particular, is an area where the threat of a regional
  nuclear exchange remains high due to continued Indo-Pakistani tensions
  over issues such as Kashmir;
  `(3) to date, United States efforts to halt proliferation in South Asia
  have failed;
  `(4) although global disarmament is a desirable goal which should be
  vigorously pursued, both regional and sub-regional security arrangements can
  serve to decrease tensions and promote non-proliferation in certain areas;
  `(5) thus far, there has been some success on a regional basis, such as
  the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and the Treaty of Tlatelolco
  in Latin America;
  `(6) in particular, in Latin America, the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been
  signed by all the nuclear powers;
  `(7) a critical part of this treaty is Protocol II which prohibits nuclear
  attacks by nuclear weapons states on signatories to the treaty;
  `(8) in 1991, a proposal was made for a regional conference on
  non-proliferation in South Asia which would include Pakistan, India,
  the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States; and
  `(9) thus far, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States have expressed
  interest in attending such a conference, whereas India has refused to attend.
  `(b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that the President should
  pursue a policy which seeks a regional negotiated solution to the issue
  of nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia at the earliest possible time,
  including a protocol to be signed by all nuclear weapons states, prohibiting
  nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on countries in the region. Such
  a policy should have as its ultimate goal concurrent accession by Pakistan
  and India to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should also include
  as needed a phased approach to that goal through a series of agreements
  among the parties on nuclear issues, such as the agreement reached by
  Pakistan and India not to attack one another's nuclear facilities.
  `(c) REPORT ON PROGRESS TOWARD REGIONAL NON-PROLIFERATION- Not later than
  April 1, 1993, and every six months thereafter, the President shall submit
  a report to the Committees on Appropriations, the Speaker of the House of
  Representatives, and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations
  of the Senate, on nuclear proliferation in South Asia, including efforts
  taken by the United States to achieve a regional agreement on nuclear
  non-proliferation, and including a comprehensive list of the obstacles to
  concluding such a regional agreement.'.
  (b) REPORT ON SOUTH ASIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMS- Not later than six months
  after the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report
  with respect to the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and India in
  writing to the Committees on Appropriations, the Speaker of the House of
  Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of
  the Senate, on those country's nuclear and ballistic missile programs,
  including, but not limited to--
  (1) a determination as to whether that country possesses a nuclear explosive
  device or whether it possesses all the components necessary for the assembly
  of such a device;
  (2) a complete report on the status of that country's missile development
  program, foreign assistance to that program, and foreign sales of missiles
  or missile components to that country and steps which the United States
  has taken in response to such sales; and
  (3) a report on whether that country has agreed to fully adhere, and is
  adhering, to all peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements with the United
  States and has formally agreed to place all United States-supplied nuclear
  materials under international safeguards in perpetuity.

POLICY ON TERMINATING THE ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL
  SEC. 598. (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--

  Israel, refusing to do business with Israel;
  (2) since the early 1950s the Arab League has maintained a secondary and
  tertiary boycott against American and other companies that have commercial
  ties with Israel;
  (3) the boycott seeks to coerce American firms by blacklisting those that
  do business with Israel and harm America's competitiveness;
  (4) the United States has a longstanding policy opposing the Arab League
  boycott and United States law prohibits American firms from providing
  information to Arab countries to demonstrate compliance with the boycott;
  (5) with real progress being made in the Middle East peace process and
  the serious confidence-building measures taken by the State of Israel,
  an end to the Arab boycott of Israel and of American companies that
  have commercial ties with Israel is long overdue and would represent a
  significant confidence-building measure;
  (6) the President has proposed the sale of 72 advanced F-15 aircraft to
  Saudi Arabia despite its refusal to renounce publicly the Arab boycott of
  American firms that do business with or invest in Israel; and
  (7) in the interest of Middle East peace and free commerce, the President
  must take more concrete steps to press the Arab states to end their practice
  of blacklisting and boycotting American companies that have trade ties
  with Israel.
  (b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that--
  (1) the Arab League countries should immediately and publicly renounce
  the primary boycott of Israel and the secondary and tertiary boycott of
  American firms that have commercial ties with Israel and
  (2) the President should--
  (A) take more concrete steps to encourage vigorously Arab League countries
  to renounce publicly the primary boycotts of Israel and the secondary and
  tertiary boycotts of American firms that have commercial relations with
  Israel as a confidence-building measure;
  (B) take into consideration the participation of any recipient country in
  the primary boycott of Israel and the secondary and tertiary boycotts of
  American firms that have commerical relations with Israel when determining
  whether to sell weapons to said country;
  (C) report to Congress on the specific steps being taken by the President to
  bring about a public renunciation of the Arab primary boycott of Israel and
  the secondary and tertiary boycotts of American firms that have commercial
  relations with Israel; and
  (D) encourage the allies and trading partners of the United States to enact
  laws prohibiting businesses from complying with the boycott and penalizing
  businesses that do comply.
IMPACT ON JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES
  SEC. 599. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated or
  expended to provide--
  (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located
  in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to

  likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in
  the United States because United States production is being replaced by
  such enterprise outside the United States;
  (b) assistance for the purpose of establishing or developing in a foreign
  country any export processing zone or designated area in which the tax,
  tariff, labor, environment, and safety laws of that country do not apply,
  in part or in whole, to activities carried out within that zone or area,
  unless the President determines and certifies that such assistance is not
  likely to cause a loss of jobs within the United States; or
  (c) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the
  violation of internationally recognized workers rights, as defined in
  section 502(a)(4) of the Trade Act of 1974, of workers in the recipient
  country, including any designated zone or area in that country.
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR ARMENIA
  SEC. 599A. (a) Of the aggregate of the funds appropriated by this Act

  not less than $5,000,000 shall be made available, notwithstanding any
  provision of law which restricts assistance to foreign countries, for
  refugee assistance to Armenia.
  (b) It is the sense of Congress that the Administration should--
  (1) encourage Japan or any oil exporting nation to provide fuel to Armenia
  for urgently needed humanitarian purposes, to include harvesting the
  autumn crop;
  (2) renew its existing commitment to deliver this fuel by United States
  transport;
  (3) ensure that safeguards are in place to guarantee that the fuel is used
  solely for the humanitarian purposes intended.
  (c) The Congress finds that Armenia has entered into an aggressive program
  of economic reforms and land privatization that serves as a model for the
  former republics of the Soviet Union.

  States representatives to the International Monetary Fund and the World
  Bank to support these important reforms by providing Armenia financial
  and technical assistance.

  activities in Guatemala, unless the President determines that to do so
  is important to the national interest and so notifies the Committees on
  Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the Senate.
AUTHORITY TO ASSIST BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA
  SEC. 599D. (a) Congress finds as follows:
  (1) the United Nations has imposed an embargo on the transfer of arms to
  any country on the territory of the former Yugoslavia;
  (2) the federated states of Serbia and Montenegro have a large supply
  of military equipment and ammunition and the Serbian forces fighting the
  government of Bosnia-Hercegovina have more than one thousand battle tanks,
  armored vehicles, and artillery pieces; and
  (3) because the United Nations arms embargo is serving to sustain the
  military advantage of the aggressor, the United Nations should exempt the
  government of Bosnia-Hercegovina from its embargo.
  (b) Pursuant to a lifting of the United Nations arms embargo against
  Bosnia-Hercegovina, the President is authorized to transfer to the government
  of that nation, without reimbursement, defense articles from the stocks of
  the Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $50,000,000

  effort.
  (c) Within 60 days of any transfer under the authority provided in subsection
  (b), and every 60 days thereafter, the President shall report in writing to
  the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of
  the Senate concerning the articles transferred and the disposition thereof.
  (d) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums
  as may be necessary to reimburse the applicable appropriation, fund,
  or account for defense articles provided under this section.

TITLE VI--LOAN GUARANTEES TO ISRAEL
LOAN GUARANTEES TO ISRAEL PROGRAM
  SEC. 601. Title III of Chapter 2 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act
  of 1961 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section:
`SEC. 226. LOAN GUARANTEES TO ISRAEL PROGRAM.
  `(a) IN GENERAL- Subject to the terms and conditions of this section,
  during the period beginning October 1, 1992, and ending September 30,
  1997, the President is authorized to issue guarantees against losses
  incurred in connection with loans to Israel made as a result of Israel's
  extraordinary humanitarian effort to resettle and absorb immigrants into
  Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other
  countries. In the event that less than the full amount authorized to be
  issued under subsection (b) of this section is issued in such period,
  the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall be available
  in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1998.
  `(b) FISCAL YEAR LEVELS- The President is authorized to issue guarantees
  in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Subject to subsection
  (d), the total principal amount of guarantees which may be issued by the
  President under this section shall be up to $10,000,000,000 which may be
  issued as follows:
  `(1) in fiscal year 1993, up to $2,000,000,000 may be issued on October 1,
  1992 or thereafter;
  `(2) subject to subsection (d), in fiscal years 1994 through 1997, up to
  $2,000,000,000 in each fiscal year may be issued on October 1 or thereafter.
  `(3) If less than the full amount of guarantees authorized to be made
  available in a fiscal year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
  subsection is issued to Israel during that fiscal year, the authority to
  issue the balance of such guarantees shall extend to any subsequent fiscal
  year ending on or before September 30, 1998.
  `(4)(A) Not later than September 1 of each year during the period in which
  the President is authorized to issue loan guarantees under subsection (a),
  beginning in fiscal year 1993, the President shall notify the appropriate
  congressional committees in writing of his intentions regarding the exercise
  of that authority for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year,
  including a statement of the total principal amount of guarantees, if any,
  that the  President proposes to issue for that fiscal year.
  `(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `appropriate congressional
  committees' means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on
  Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and
  the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.
  `(c) USE OF GUARANTEES- Guarantees may be issued under this section only
  to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the
  administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.
  `(d) LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE AMOUNT- The amount of authorized but unissued
  guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified
  in subsection (b) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount
  extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel
  during the previous year for activities which the President determines
  are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings
  reached between the United States Government and the Government of Israel
  regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall
  submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year
  during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under
  this subsection  and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees
  authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.
  `(e) FEES-
  `(1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each
  year shall be an aggregate annual  origination fee equal to the estimated
  subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section  for that year,
  calculated by the Office of Management  and Budget for the Federal Credit
  Reform Act of 1990. This shall also include an amount  for the administrative
  expenses of the Agency  for International Development in administering the
  program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government
  of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for
  Israel under chapter 4 of Part II of the Foreign  Assistance Act of 1961,
  as amended, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to
  the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy  cost
  are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder  for fiscal year
  1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.
  `(2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government
  on a pro rata basis as each  guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.
  `(f) AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND- Except as provided in subsections (l) and (m)
  of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions
  for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and
  conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate
  the provision of all or part of the additional  loan guarantees not yet
  issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend  or
  terminate  the provision  of loan guarantees, the President shall submit
  to the Speaker of the House  of Representatives and the President Pro
  Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for
  such suspension  or termination.
  `(g) PROCEDURES FOR SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION- Any suspension or termination
  pursuant to subsection (f) shall be in accordance with the following
  procedures:
  `(1) Upon making a determination to suspend  or terminate the provision
  of loan guarantees, the President shall submit  to the Speaker of the
  House  of Representatives  and the President  Pro Tempore of the Senate
  his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or
  termination.
  `(2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress
  enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the
  assistance notwithstanding  the suspension.
  `(3) Any such joint  resolution shall be considered  in the Senate in
  accordance with the provisions of section  601(b) of the International
  Security Assistance  and Arms  Export Control Act of 1976.
  `(4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of
  joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the
  consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by
  the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the
  House of Representatives.
  `(5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional
  loan guarantees under subsection (f) and Congress does not enact a joint
  resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan
  guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed
  only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the
  reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is
  otherwise in the national interest.
  `(h) ECONOMIC CONTEXT- The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel
  from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the
  private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to
  promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment
  and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel
  is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and
  that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year
  economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural
  reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed
  to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system
  and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic
  stability and sustainable growth.
  `(i) CONSULTATIONS- It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between
  the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in
  subsection (h), Israel and the United States should continue to engage
  in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including
  structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the
  pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle
  immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result
  from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the
  Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address
  progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatization, trade
  liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition
  policy, and deregulation.
  `(j) GOODS AND SERVICES- During the pendency of the loan program authorized
  under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic
  reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section,
  Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants,
  and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy
  with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and
  services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel
  will substantially increase.
  `(k) REPORTS- The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of
  each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of
  this section.
  `(l) APPLICABILITY OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT AUTHORITIES- Section 223
  of the Foreign Assistance Act shall apply to guarantees issued under
  subsection (a) in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees
  issued under section 222, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and
  (j) of section 223 shall not apply to such guarantees and except that,
  to the extent section 223 is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform
  Act of 1990, that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this
  section without regard to sections 221, 222, and 238(c). Notwithstanding
  section 223(f), the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section
  may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the
  borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section
  in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of
  loan principal. Guarantees once issued hereunder shall be unconditional
  and fully and freely transferable.
  `(m) Terms and Conditions-
  `(1) Each loan guarantee issued under this section shall guarantee 100
  percent of the principal and interest payable on such loans.
  `(2) The standard terms of any loan or increment guaranteed under this
  section shall be 30 years with semiannual payments of interest only over
  the first 10 years, and with semiannual payments of principal and interest
  on a level payment basis, over the last 20 years thereof, except that the
  guaranteed loan or any increments issued in a single transaction may include
  obligations having different maturities, interest rates, and payment terms
  if the aggregate scheduled debt service for all obligations issued in a
  single transaction equals the debt service for a single loan or increment
  of like amount having the standard terms described in this sentence. The
  guarantor shall not have the right to accelerate any guaranteed loan or
  increment or to pay any amounts in respect of the guarantees issued other
  than in accordance with the original payment terms of the loan. For purposes
  of determining the maximum principal amount of any loan or increment to
  be guaranteed under this section, the principal amount of each such loan
  or increment shall be--
  `(A) in the case of any loan issued on a discount basis, the original
  issue price (excluding any transaction costs) thereof; or
  `(B) in the case of any loan issue on an interest-bearing basis, the stated
  principal amount thereof.'.
  This Act may be cited as the `Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and
  Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1993'.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
