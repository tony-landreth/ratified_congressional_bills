TITLE II--GENERAL PROVISIONS
 SEC. 200. FINDING OF DIRE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS- The Congress finds that--
 (a) the President has designated and requested the Congress to designate
 over $1,140,000,000 in 1991 international assistance funds to meet emergency
 needs in foreign lands;
 (b) natural disasters (including floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes,
 earthquakes, freezes, and typhoons) have occurred in the United States
 and its territories causing loss of life, human suffering, loss of income,
 and property loss or damage with dire emergency financial situations;
 (c) since October 1990, there have been 44 presidentially-declared disasters
 and 89 disasters declared by the Secretary of Agriculture affecting every
 area of the Nation in almost every State for which Federal funds are not
 available to meet emergency needs, resulting in calls for the National
 Guard and other assistance;
 (d) as a consequence of these disasters, millions of acres of land are or
 were under water, millions of acres of farm land are not able to be planted,
 and highways, dams, roads, and bridges have not been repaired. Many of the
 people in communities, counties, States, and many private businesses have
 been dangerously affected, and the local authorities in many cases are
 unable to meet the financial costs; and
 (e) the combination of the effects of these conditions and the current
 recession constitutes a dire emergency situation (8,582,000 people are
 unemployed, total employment has declined by over 1,400,000 jobs in the
 last year, over 7,500 businesses are failing each month, and foreign
 purchases of United States land and companies are increasing) which will,
 if not corrected by increased production, necessitate the need for a Job
 Creation Bill similar to what was enacted in 1983.
 SEC. 201. No part of any appropriation contained in this joint resolution
 shall remain available for obligation beyond the current fiscal year unless
 expressly so provided herein.
CONGRESSIONAL DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCY
 SEC. 202. Although the President has only designated portions of the funds
 in this joint resolution pertaining to the incremental costs of Desert
 Shield/Desert Storm and certain Federal Emergency Management Agency costs
 as `emergency requirements', the Congress believes that the same or higher
 priority should be given to helping American people recover from natural
 disasters and other emergency situations as has been given to foreign aid
 `emergency' needs. The Congress therefore designates all funds in Titles I
 and II of this joint resolution as `emergency requirements' for all purposes
 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
restrictions on assistance for kenya
 SEC. 203. (a) RESTRICTIONS- None of the funds appropriated by this joint
 resolution or any other provision of law under the heading `Economic Support
 Fund' or `Foreign Military Financing Program' may be made available for
 Kenya unless the President determines, and so certifies to the Congress,
 that the Government of Kenya--
 (1) has released all political detainees and has ended the prosecution of
 individuals for the peaceful expression of their political beliefs;
 (2) has ceased the physical abuse or mistreatment of prisoners;
 (3) has restored judicial independence;
 (4) has taken significant steps toward respecting human rights and fundamental
 freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, belief, expression,
 and the freedom to advocate the establishment of political parties and
 organizations; and
 (5) has implemented the principle of freedom of movement, including the
 right of all citizens of Kenya to leave and return to their country.
 (b) Prohibition-
 (1) LIMITATION ON NEW PROJECT ASSISTANCE- During fiscal year 1992, funds
 appropriated by this or any other Act to carry out the provisions of chapters
 1 and 10 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that are provided
 for assistance to the Government of Kenya for new projects shall be made
 available only for new projects--
 (A) that promote basic human needs, directly address poverty, enhance
 employment generation, and address environmental concerns; or
 (B) to improve the performance of democratic institutions, or otherwise
 promote the objectives being sought in the certification required by
 subsection (a).
 (2) CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION- During fiscal year 1992, none of the funds
 appropriated by this or any other Act to carry out the provisions of chapters
