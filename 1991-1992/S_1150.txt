 `(5) REVIEW OF INSURANCE PREMIUM- In fiscal year 1995, the Secretary is
 directed to analyze the risk rates of borrowers who have participated in
 this program in the 2 previous fiscal years. If the Secretary finds, that

 guaranty agency receives notice from the Secretary that the designation of
 the lender or servicer under subsection (a) has been revoked.

 Secretary shall inform the eligible lender or servicer and the appropriate
 guaranty agency that its application for designation as an exceptional
 lender or servicer has been approved.

 fiscal year, the Secretary shall include only loans for which the Secretary
 or a guaranty agency has paid claims for insurance, and, in calculating the
 cohort default rate, exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or
 collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the
 cohort default rate.
 `(C) For any fiscal year in which fewer than 30 of the institution's current
 and former students enter repayment, the term `cohort default rate' means

 at more than one school, the student (and such student's subsequent repayment

 received a loan that entered repayment in the fiscal year.
 `(B) A loan on which a payment is made by the school, such school's  owner,
 agent, contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated
 with such school, in order to avoid default by the borrower, is considered
 as in default for purposes of this subsection.

 fiscal year is not considered as in default for the purposes of this
 subsection.

 or certificate at an eligible institution on at least a half-time basis (as
 determined by the institution) and ceased to be in a period of forbearance
 based on such enrollment. Each eligible lender of a loan made under section

 determine when the loan entered repayment for purposes of this subsection,
 and the guaranty agency shall provide such information to the Secretary.
 `(3) REGULATIONS TO PREVENT EVASIONS- The Secretary shall prescribe

-----------------------------------------------------
`SEC. 478. REGULATIONS; UPDATED TABLES.
 `(a) AUTHORITY TO PRESCRIBE REGULATIONS RESTRICTED- (1) Notwithstanding
 any other provision of law, the Secretary shall not have the authority to
 prescribe regulations to carry out this part except--
 `(A) to prescribe updated tables in accordance with subsections (b) through
 (h) of this section; or
 `(B) to propose modifications in the need analysis methodology required by
 this part.
 `(2) Any regulation proposed by the Secretary that (A) updates tables in a
 manner that does not comply with subsections (b) through (h) of this section,
 or (B) that proposes modifications under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection,
 shall not be effective unless approved by joint resolution of the Congress
 by May 1 following the date such regulations are published in the Federal
 Register in accordance with section 482. If the Congress fails to approve
 such regulations by such May 1, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal
 Register in accordance with section 482 updated tables for the applicable
 award year that are prescribed in accordance with subsections (b) through
 (h) of this section.
 `(b) INCOME PROTECTION ALLOWANCE- For each academic year after academic year
 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised
 table of income protection allowances for the purpose of sections 475(c)(4)
 and 477(b)(4). Such revised table shall be developed by increasing each of the
 dollar amounts contained in the table in each such section by a percentage
 equal to the estimated percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (as
 determined by the Secretary) between December 1992 and the December next
 preceding the beginning of such academic year, and rounding the result to
 the nearest $10.
 `(c) ADJUSTED NET WORTH OF A FARM OR BUSINESS- For each award year after
 award year 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
 revised table of adjusted net worth of a farm or business for purposes of
 sections 475(d)(2)(C), 476(c)(2)(C), and 477(c)(2)(C). Such revised table
 shall be developed--
 `(1) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to net worth of a farm
 or  business by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in
 the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between 1992 and
 the December next preceding the beginning of such award year, and rounding
 the result to the nearest $5,000; and
 `(2) by adjusting the dollar amounts `$30,000', `$105,000', and `$195,000'
 to reflect the changes made pursuant to paragraph (1).
 `(d) EDUCATION SAVINGS AND ASSET PROTECTION ALLOWANCE- For each award
 year after award year 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal
 Register a revised table of allowances for the purpose of sections 475(d)(3),
 476(c)(3), and 477(c)(3). Such revised table shall be developed by determining
 the present value cost, rounded to the nearest $100, of an annuity that would
 provide, for each age cohort of 40 and above, a supplemental income at age 65
 (adjusted for inflation) equal to the difference between the moderate family
 income (as most recently determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics),
 and the current average social security retirement benefits. For each age
 cohort below 40, the allowance shall be computed by decreasing the allowance
 for age 40, as updated, by one-fifteenth for each year of age below age 40
 and rounding the result to the nearest $100. In making such determinations--
 `(1) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 percent per year;
 `(2) the rate of return of an annuity shall be presumed to be 8 percent; and
 `(3) the sales commission on an annuity shall be presumed to be 6 percent.
 `(e) ASSESSMENT SCHEDULES AND RATES- For each award year after award year
 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised
 table of assessments from adjusted available income for the purpose of
 sections 475(e) and 477(d). Such revised table shall be developed--
 `(1) by increasing each dollar amount that refers to adjusted available
 income by a percentage equal to the estimated percentage increase in the
 Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary) between December
 1992 and the December next preceding the beginning of such academic year,
 rounded to the nearest $100; and
 `(2) by adjusting the other dollar amounts to reflect the changes made
 pursuant to paragraph (1).
 `(f) DEFINITION OF CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- As used in this section, the term
 `Consumer Price Index' means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
 published by the Department of Labor. Each annual update of tables to reflect
 changes in the Consumer Price Index shall be corrected for misestimation
 of actual changes in such Index in previous years.
 `(g) STATE AND OTHER TAX ALLOWANCE- For each award year after award year
 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a revised table
 of State and other tax allowances for the purpose of sections 475(c)(2),
 475(g)(3), 476(b)(2), and 477(b)(2). The Secretary shall develop such
 revised table after review of the Department of the Treasury's Statistics
 of Income file and determination of the percentage of income that each
 State's taxes represent.
 `(h) EMPLOYMENT EXPENSE ALLOWANCE- For each award year after award
 year 1992-1993, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
 revised table of employment expense allowances for the purpose of sections
 475(c)(5), 476(b)(4), and 477(b)(5). Such revised table shall be developed
 by increasing the dollar amount specified in sections 475(c)(5)(A),
 475(c)(5)(B), 476(b)(4)(A), 476(b)(4)(B), 477(b)(5)(A), and 477(b)(5)(B)
 to reflect increases in the amount and percent of the Bureau of Labor
 Standards budget of the marginal costs for meals away from home, apparel
 and upkeep, transportation, and housekeeping services for a two-worker
 versus one-worker family.
`SEC. 479. SIMPLIFIED NEEDS TESTS.
 `(a) SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION SECTION-

 simplified application section as part of the common financial reporting
 form prescribed under section 483(a) for families described in subsections
 (b) and (c) this section.
 `(2) REDUCED DATA REQUIREMENTS- The simplified application form shall--
 `(A) in the case of a family meeting the requirements of subsection (b)(1),
 permit such family to submit only the data elements required under subsection
 (b)(2) for the purposes of establishing eligibility for student financial
 aid under this part; and
 `(B) in the case of a family meeting the requirements of subsection (c),
 permit such family to be treated as having an expected family contribution
 equal to zero for purposes of establishing such eligibility and to submit
 only the data elements required to make a determination under subsection (c).
 `(b) SIMPLIFIED NEEDS TEST-
 `(1) ELIGIBILITY- An applicant is eligible to file a simplified form
 containing the elements required by paragraph (2) if--
 `(A) in the case of an applicant who is a dependent student--
 `(i) the student's parents file or are eligible to file a form described
 in paragraph (3) or certify that they are not required to file an income
 tax return and the student files or is eligible to file such a form or
 certifies that the student is not required to file an income tax return; and
 `(ii) the total adjusted gross income of the parents (excluding any income
 of the dependent student) is less than $50,000; or
 `(B) in the case of an applicant who is an independent student--
 `(i) the student files or is eligible to file a form described in paragraph
 (3) or certifies that the student is not required to file such an income
 tax return; and
 `(ii) the adjusted gross income of the student (and the student's spouse,
 if any) is less than $50,000.
 `(2) SIMPLIFIED TEST ELEMENTS- The five elements to be used for the simplified
 needs analysis are--
 `(A) adjusted gross income,
 `(B) Federal taxes paid,
 `(C) untaxed income and benefits,
 `(D) the number of family members,
 `(E) the number of family members in postsecondary education; and
 `(F) an allowance (A) for State and other taxes, as defined in section
 475(c)(2) for dependent students and in section 477(b)(2) for independent
 students with dependents other than a spouse, or (B) for State and other
 income taxes, as defined in section 476(b)(2) for independent students
 without dependents other than a spouse.
 `(3) QUALIFYING FORMS- A student or family files a form described in this
 paragraph if the student or family, respectively, files--
 `(A) a form 1040A or 1040EZ required pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code
 of 1986; or
 `(B) an income tax return required pursuant to the tax code of the
 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands,
 the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,
 or Palau.
 `(c) ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION- The Secretary shall consider an
 applicant to have an expected family contribution equal to zero if--
 `(1) in the case of a dependent student--
 `(A) the student's parents did not file, and were not required to file,
 a form 1040 required pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
 `(B) the sum of the adjusted gross income of the parents is less than or
 equal to the maximum amount of income (rounded annually to the nearest
 thousand dollars) that may be earned in order to claim the maximum Federal
 earned income credit; or
 `(2) in the case of an independent student with dependents other than
 a spouse--
 `(A) the student (and the student's spouse, if any) did not file, and was
 not required to file, a form 1040 required pursuant to the Internal Revenue
 Code of 1986; and
 `(B) the sum of the adjusted gross income of the student and spouse
 (if appropriate) is less than or equal to the maximum amount of income
 (rounded annually to the nearest thousand dollars) that may be earned in
 order to claim the maximum Federal earned income credit.
An individual is not required to qualify or file for the earned income credit
in order to be eligible under this subsection.
`SEC. 479A. DISCRETION OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS.
 `(a) IN GENERAL- Nothing in this part shall be interpreted as limiting the
 authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of adequate
 documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the cost
 of attendance or the values of the data items required to calculate the
 expected student or parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of
 an individual eligible applicant with special circumstances. However, this
 authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to deviate from
 the contributions expected in the absence of special circumstances. Special
 circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student
 from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class
 of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate
 such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in
 this title shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student
 financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary
 information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible
 applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards
 under this title. No student or parent shall be charged a fee for collecting,
 processing, or delivering such supplementary information.
 `(b) ADJUSTMENTS TO ASSETS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- A student financial aid
 administrator shall be considered to be making a necessary adjustment in
 accordance with subsection (a) if--
 `(1) the administrator makes adjustments excluding from family income
 any proceeds of a sale of farm or business assets of a family if such
 sale results from a voluntary or involuntary foreclosure, forfeiture,
 or bankruptcy or an involuntary liquidation; or
 `(2) the administrator makes adjustments in the award level of a student
 with a disability so as to take into consideration the additional costs
 such student incurs as a result of such student's disability.

 integral role in leading our Nation's schools into the 21st century;
 `(2) we should encourage individuals to enter the education profession
 so that our teaching force is representative both of the diversity of our
 Nation and of the tremendous talents and skills of our citizens;
 `(3) the methods used to prepare prospective teachers and the continuing
 education and support provided to practicing teachers have a significant
 influence on the effectiveness of classroom teachers;

 has not promoted systematic and sustained improvement of the education system;

 to carry out a mission of supporting a process to achieve local, State,
 or national goals and standards;
 `(7) in order to encourage more women and underrepresented minorities to
 enter the fields of science and mathematics and succeed in these fields, we
 must provide proper training for existing mathematics and science teachers
 and recruit women and underrepresented minorities as teachers in these fields;
 `(8) educators must have the expertise and the support that allow them to
 adapt to the changing environment in our schools and to the evolving skills
 required of our schools' graduates; and

 educator training and professional development that will enable teachers
 to be classroom leaders and administrators to be school leaders at the
 forefront of reforming our Nation's schools.

 `(1) to provide assistance to our Nation's teaching force for the continued
 improvement of their professional skills;
 `(2) to provide assistance for professional development activities enabling
 teachers, school administrators, and institutions of higher education to
 work collaboratively to improve educational performance through school
 reform and restructuring;
 `(3) to address the Nation's teacher shortage, particularly in areas where
 there are heavy concentrations of low-income students, by encouraging
 talented persons, including the individuals already employed as school
 paraprofessionals and individuals who have been employed in other areas of
 endeavor, to enter the teaching profession;
 `(4) to encourage academically qualified students to become teachers through
 scholarship assistance;
 `(5) to support the recruitment of underrepresented populations into
 teaching careers;
 `(6) to provide scholarship assistance to encourage women and minorities
 who are underrepresented in the fields of science and mathematics to enter
 the teaching profession in these fields;
 `(7) to encourage the establishment and maintenance of programs that provide
 professional teacher preparation to individuals who are moving to careers
 in education from other occupations;
 `(8) to promote partnerships between institutions of higher education and
 local educational agencies for the purpose of promoting the simultaneous
 restructuring and renewal of elementary and secondary schools and
 college-based teacher education programs;
 `(9) to improve the leadership and administrative skills of elementary and
 secondary school administrators;
 `(10) to provide assistance to schools of education in institutions of higher
 education in order to reform teacher education programs by encouraging new
 developments in teacher preparation which provide for greater integration of
 subject matter and pedagogical training and which prepare classroom teachers
 to effectively meet changing noneducational challenges in the schools; and
 `(11) to promote high quality child development and early childhood education
 specialist training programs, including preschool and early intervention

`SEC. 552. SHORT TITLE.
 `This subpart may be cited as the `Alternative Routes to Teacher Certification
 and Licensure Act of 1992'.
`SEC. 553. FINDINGS.
 `The Congress finds that--
 `(1) effective elementary and secondary schools require competent teachers
 and strong leadership;
 `(2) school systems would benefit greatly by increasing the pool of qualified
 individuals from which to recruit teachers;
 `(3) many talented professionals who have demonstrated a high level of subject
 area competence outside the education profession may wish to pursue careers
 in education, but have not fulfilled the requirements to be certified or
 licensed as teachers;
 `(4) alternative routes can enable qualified individuals to fulfill State
 certification or licensure requirements and would allow school systems
 to utilize the expertise of such professionals and improve the pool of
 qualified individuals available to local educational agencies as teachers; and
 `(5) alternative routes to certification or licensure requirements that
 do not exclude qualified individuals from teaching solely because such
 individuals do not meet traditional certification or licensure requirements
 would allow school systems to take advantage of these professionals and
 improve the supply of well-qualified teachers.
`SEC. 554. PURPOSE.
 `It is the purpose of this subpart to improve the supply of well-qualified
 elementary and secondary school teachers by encouraging and assisting
 States to develop and implement programs for alternative routes to teacher
 certification or licensure requirements. Such programs shall place special
 emphasis on the participation of individuals who are members of minority
 groups.

 is satisfactory to the Secretary).
 `(2) REALLOCATION- If a State does not apply for its allotment, or the full
 amount of its allotment, under the preceding paragraph, the Secretary may
 reallocate the excess funds to one or more other States that demonstrate,
 to the satisfaction of the Secretary, a current need for the funds.
 `(b) SPECIAL RULE- Notwithstanding section 412(b) of the General Education
 Provisions Act, funds awarded under this subpart shall remain available for
 obligation by a recipient for a period of two calendar years from the date

SEC. 704. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING.
 Part B of title VII of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1132c et seq.) is amended to read
 as follows:
`PART B--HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING
`SEC. 721. FINDINGS.
 `The Congress finds that--
 `(1) a significant part of the Federal mission in education has been to
 attain equal opportunity in higher education for low-income, educationally
 disadvantaged Americans and African Americans;
 `(2) the Nation's historically Black colleges and universities have played
 a prominent role in American history and have an unparalleled record of
 fostering the development of African American youth by recognizing their
 potential, enhancing their academic and technical skills, and honing their
 social and political skills through higher education;
 `(3) the academic and residential facilities on the campuses of all
 historically Black colleges and universities have suffered from neglect,
 deferred maintenance and are in need of capital improvements in order to
 provide appropriate settings for learning and social development through
 higher education;
 `(4) due to their small enrollments, limited endowments and other financial
 factors normally considered by lenders in construction financing, historically
 Black colleges and universities often lack access to the sources of funding
 necessary to undertake the necessary capital improvements through borrowing
 and bond financing;
 `(5) despite their track record of long-standing and remarkable institutional
 longevity and viability, historically Black colleges and universities often
 lack the financial resources necessary to gain access to traditional sources
 of capital financing such as bank loans and bond financing; and
 `(6) Federal assistance to facilitate low-cost capital basis for historically
 Black colleges and universities will enable such colleges and universities to
 continue and expand their educational mission and enhance their significant
 role in American higher education.

 after completion of a facility for which assistance is requested under
 this part, at least a 2-year program acceptable for full credit toward a
 baccalaureate degree (including any public educational institution, or any
 private educational institution no part of the net earnings of which inures
 to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual); or
 `(B) any public educational institution which--
 `(i) is administered by a college or university which is accredited by a
 nationally recognized accrediting agency or association;
 `(ii) offers technical or vocational instruction; and
 `(iii) provides residential facilities for some or all of the students
 receiving such instruction;
 `(2) any hospital operating a school of nursing beyond the level of high
 school approved by the appropriate State authority, or any hospital approved
 for internships, by recognized authority, if such hospital is either a public
 hospital or a private hospital, no part of the net earnings of which inures
 to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual;
 `(3) any corporation (no part of the net earnings of which inures to the
 benefit of any private shareholder or individual)--
 `(A) established for the sole purpose of providing housing or other
 educational facilities for students or students and faculty of one or more
 institutions included in paragraph (1) without regard to their membership
 in or affiliation with any social, fraternal, or honorary society or
 organization; and
 `(B) upon dissolution of which all title to any property purchased or
 built from the proceeds of any loan which is made under section 731 (as
 such section was in effect prior to the date of enactment of the Higher
 Education Amendments of 1992), will pass to such institution (or to any
 one or more of such institutions) unless it is shown to the satisfaction
 of the Secretary that such property or the proceeds from its sale will be
 used for some other nonprofit educational purpose;
 `(4) any agency, public authority, or other instrumentality of any State,
 established for the purpose of providing or financing housing or other

corporation and the proposed project to be approved by such institution
