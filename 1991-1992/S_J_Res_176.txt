Joint Resolution
To designate March 19, 1992, as `National Women in Agriculture Day'.
Whereas women hold important leadership positions within the American
agriculture system, a system with a level of efficiency that leads the world;
Whereas women are full working partners on the family farm;
Whereas the family farm offers the best means of ensuring the protection of
our natural resources as well as guaranteeing future generations of Americans
an abundant and safe supply of food; and
Whereas the public should be aware of the contributions made by women in the
American agricultural system to the health and prosperity of all Americans:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 19, 1992, is designated as
 `National Women in Agriculture Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States
 to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
