AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the second week in May 1991 as `National Tourism Week'.
Whereas travel and tourism is the third largest retail industry and the
second largest private employer in the United States, generating nearly six
million jobs and indirectly employing another two million six hundred and
forty thousand Americans;
Whereas total travel expenditures in the United States amount to more than
$350,000,000,000 annually, or about 6.5 percent of the gross national product;
Whereas tourism is an essential American export, as thirty-eight million
seven hundred thousand foreign travelers spend approximately $44,000,000,000
annually in the United States;
Whereas development and promotion of tourism have brought new industries, jobs
and economic revitalization to cities and regions across the United States;
Whereas tourism contributes substantially to personal growth, education,
appreciation of intercultural differences, and the enhancement of international
understanding and good will; and
Whereas the abundant natural and manmade attractions of the United States
and the hospitality of the American people establish the United States as
the preeminent destination for both foreign and domestic travelers: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning the first Sunday in May
 1991 is designated as `National Tourism Week'. The President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
 States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
