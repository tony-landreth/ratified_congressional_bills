H.J.Res.279
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To declare it to be the policy of the United States that there should be a
renewed and sustained commitment by the Federal Government and the American
people to the importance of adult education.
Whereas a well educated citizenry is the foundation of democracy, the people
of all ages should use every means available to gain knowledge and skills;
Whereas the Adult Education Act offers educational opportunities for
out-of-school adults age 16 and older who lack the literacy levels needed
for effective citizenship and productive employment;
Whereas the Adult Education Act serves adults who need to acquire basic and
life skills, to continue their education through secondary school, and to
attain literacy levels required to secure employment or occupational training;
Whereas the Adult Education Act puts special emphasis on such adult populations
as the incarcerated, individuals of limited English proficiency, adults with
disabilities, adult immigrants, the chronically unemployed, homeless adults,
the institutionalized, and minorities;
Whereas the Adult Education Act has provided adult basic, adult secondary,
and English-as-a-Second-Language instruction to over 40,000,000 men and
women since 1966;
Whereas the Adult Education Act has initiated programs located throughout
the 57 States and territories, in urban, suburban, and rural settings;
Whereas the Adult Education Act encourages the participation of over 94,000
volunteers who selflessly devote their time to educating adults in need of
literacy instruction;
Whereas the Adult Education Act supports the national goal that every adult
American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skill necessary
to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship;
Whereas the Adult Education Act reinforces the principle that we are a nation
of students and recognizes that learning is a lifelong process;
Whereas on November 3, 1966, the Adult Education Act was signed into law; and
Whereas the Congress supports the Adult Education Act's goal of educating
adults so that they can lead fulfilling, more productive lives: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That it is the policy of the United
 States that--
 (1) the 25th anniversary of Federal aid to improve the basic and literacy
 skills of adults through the Adult Education Act should be recognized and
 observed by the Nation; and
 (2) there should be a continued commitment to Federal aid for educating
 adults through the Adult Education Act in order to increase adult literacy and
 assure a productive workforce and a competitive America in the 21st century.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
