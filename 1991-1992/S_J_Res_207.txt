S.J.Res.207
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing on November 24, 1991, and ending on
November 30, 1991, and the period commencing on November 22, 1992, and ending
on November 28, 1992, each as `National Adoption Week'.
Whereas Thanksgiving week has been commemorated as `National Adoption Week'
for the past 13 years;
Whereas the Congress recognizes that belonging to a secure, loving, and
permanent family is every child's right;
Whereas the President of the United States has actively promoted the benefits
of adoption by implementing a Federal program to encourage Federal employees
to consider adoption;
Whereas approximately 36,000 children who may be characterized as having
special needs such as being of school age, being members of a sibling group,
being members of a minority group, or having physical, mental, and emotional
disabilities are now in foster care or in institutions financed at public
expense and are legally free for adoption;
Whereas public and private barriers inhibiting the placement of special needs
children must be reviewed and removed where possible to assure their adoption;
Whereas the adoption of institutionalized or foster care children by capable
parents into permanent homes would ensure an opportunity for their continued
happiness and long-range well-being;
Whereas the public and prospective parents must be informed that there are
children available for adoption;
Whereas media, agencies, adoptive parent and advocacy groups, civic and church
groups, businesses, and industries will provide publicity and information
to heighten community awareness of the crucial needs of children available
for adoption; and
Whereas the recognition of Thanksgiving week as `National Adoption Week'
is in the best interest of adoptable children and in the best interest of
the public generally: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing on November 24,
 1991, and ending on November 30, 1991, and the period commencing on November
 22, 1992, and ending on November 28, 1992, are each designated as `National
 Adoption Week', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe each week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
