Whereas almost 35,000,000 individuals in the United States are victimized
by crime each year, with 6,000,000 falling prey to violence;
Whereas the victims of violent crime need and deserve quality programs and
services to help them recover from the devastating psychological, physical,
and emotional hardships resulting from their victimization;

victims, victim service providers, criminal justice officials, and concerned
citizens to make victims' rights and services a reality in the Nation,
and the 10th anniversary of the historic passage of the Victim and Witness
Protection Act of 1982 by the Congress;
Whereas over the past 2 decades the road to justice for the victims of crime
has been paved with the commitment, perseverance, and spirit of millions of
victims who have proudly carried the banner of justice in our Nation; and
Whereas all Americans should join together to fight the continuing threat
of crime and victimization by committing their individual and collective
resources to crime prevention and victim services: Now, therefore, be it

 America in Congress assembled, That April 26, 1992, through May 2, 1992,
