S.J.Res.172
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To authorize and request the President to proclaim each of the months
of November
1991 and 1992 as `National American Indian Heritage Month'.
Whereas American Indians are the original inhabitants of the lands that now
constitute the United States of America;
Whereas American Indian governments developed fundamental principles of
freedom of speech and the separation of powers in government, and these
principles form the foundation of our own government today;
Whereas American Indian societies exhibited a respect for the finiteness
of natural resources through deep respect for the earth, and such values
continue to be widely held today;
Whereas American Indian people have served with valor in all wars since the
Revolutionary War to the War in the Persian Gulf, often in a percentage well
above their percentage in the population of the Nation as a whole;
Whereas American Indians have made distinct and important contributions
to America and the rest of the world in many fields including agriculture,
medicine, music, language and art;
Whereas it is fitting that American Indians be recognized for their individual
contributions to American society as artists, sculptors, musicians, authors,
poets, artisans, scientists and scholars;
Whereas the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the
Western Hemisphere is an especially appropriate time for all the people of
the United States to study and reflect on the long history of the original
inhabitants of this continent;
Whereas the Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives believe that
a resolution and proclamation as requested in this resolution will encourage
self-esteem, pride and self-awareness in American Indians young and old;
Whereas the month of November is the traditional harvest season of the
American Indians and is generally a time of celebration and giving thanks:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF MONTH.
 That each of the months of November 1991 and 1992 are designated as `National
 American Indian Heritage Month', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation for each such year calling upon Federal, State,
 and local governments, interested groups and organizations, and the people
 of the United States to observe each such month with appropriate programs,
 ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
