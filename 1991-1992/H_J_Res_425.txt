H.J.Res.425
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating May 10, 1992, as `Infant Mortality Awareness Day'.
Whereas, in 1989, the infant mortality rate in the United States decreased
from 10.0 to 9.8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births;
Whereas, despite such decrease, nearly 38,000 infants in the United States
will die in 1992 before they reach their 1st birthday;
Whereas thousands of infants will suffer lifelong disabilities resulting
from low birthweight and other complications;
Whereas thousands of pregnant women, especially low-income women, cannot
receive adequate prenatal care because they lack access to providers of
obstetrical care;
Whereas infant mortality is a widespread problem which afflicts both urban
and rural areas in all geographic regions of the United States;
Whereas the number of births to teenage mothers, who have a greater risk of
giving birth to sick infants, has increased by 20 percent in the last 3 years;
Whereas the high number of deaths, disabilities, and illnesses among infants
in the United States is deplorable; and
Whereas expectant parents in the United States should work toward the birth
of healthy babies: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That May 10, 1992, is designated as `Infant
 Mortality Awareness Day', and the President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe
 the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
