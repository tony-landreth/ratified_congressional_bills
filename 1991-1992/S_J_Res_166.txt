Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
Designating the week of October 4 through 10, 1992, as `National
Customer Service Week'.
Whereas recognizing the value and importance of the customer drives the
quality of customer service;
Whereas the high cost of attracting new customers today further emphasizes
the need to keep existing customers through effective service;
Whereas when customer service is recognized as contributing to the profit of
a company, the professional status of customer service continues to increase;
Whereas excellent customer service distinguishes successful companies that
understand the importance and influence a customer has on success; and
Whereas excellent customer service contributes to the growth and success of
every company: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 4 through 10,
  1992, is designated as `National Customer Service Week', and the President
  is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of
  the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
  and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
