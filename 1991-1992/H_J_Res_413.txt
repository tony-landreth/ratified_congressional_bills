AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To designate September 13, 1992, as `Commodore John Barry Day'.
Whereas John Barry, an immigrant from County Wexford, Ireland, volunteered
his services to the Continental Navy and was commissioned as captain on
October 10, 1775;
Whereas during the War for Independence Captain John Barry achieved the first
victory for the Continental Navy while in command of the ship `Lexington' by
capturing the British ship `Edward', organized General George Washington's
crossing of the Delaware River which led to the victory at Trenton in
1776, transported gold from France to America while in command of the ship
`Alliance', and achieved the last victory of the war for the Continental
Navy while in command of `Alliance' by defeating the British ship HMS Sybille;
Whereas during the War for Independence Captain John Barry rejected British
General Lord Howe's offer to desert the Continental Navy and join the British
Navy, stating: `Not the value and command of the whole British fleet can
lure me from the cause of my country.';
Whereas after the War for Independence the United States Congress recognized
John Barry as the premier American naval hero of that war;
Whereas in 1787 Captain John Barry organized the compulsory attendance of
members of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, thus ensuring the
quorum necessary to adopt the Constitution and recommend it to the States
for ratification;
Whereas on June 14, 1794, pursuant to `Commission No. 1', President Washington
commissioned John Barry as commodore in the new United States Navy;
Whereas Commodore John Barry helped to build and lead the new United
States Navy which included his command of the U.S.S. United States and
U.S.S. Constitution (`Old Ironsides');
Whereas Commodore John Barry is recognized along with General Stephen Moylan
in the Statue of Liberty Museum as 1 of 6 foreign-born great leaders of the
War for Independence;
Whereas in 1991 President George Bush proclaimed September 13th, the date
of John Barry's birth, as `Commodore John Barry Day'; and
Whereas designating a day to commemorate Commodore John Barry would be
important to United States Navy veterans, Irish-Americans, and to all the
people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That September 13, 1992, is designated
  as `Commodore John Barry Day', and the President of the United States is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
  of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies
  and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
