  vehicle distributed in commerce for sale in the United States shall
  annually establish for each model year and cause to be affixed, and each
  dealer shall cause to be maintained, on each such vehicle manufactured on
  or after October 1, 1994, in a prominent place, one or more labels--

  content';
  `(B) indicating the final assembly point by city, State (where appropriate),

  and shall be applicable to that carline for the entire model year.
  `(3) The disclosure requirement of subparagraph (1)(B) of this section
  supersedes the disclosure requirement of section 3(b) of the Automobile

  section. Such regulations shall provide to the ultimate purchaser of a new

  without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers. The
  regulations shall be promulgated promptly after the enactment of this
  section in order to provide adequate lead time for all manufacturers
  to comply with this section. The regulations shall include provisions
  applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to
  certify whether a component provided by such suppliers is United States,
  U.S./Canadian, or foreign and to provide such other information as may be
  necessary, as determined by the Secretary, to enable the manufacturer to
  reasonably comply with the provisions of this section and to rely on such
  certification and information. The regulations applicable to all suppliers
  shall be enforceable as a regulation of the Secretary under the appropriate
  provisions of this Act.
  `(e) VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES- Any manufacturer of automobiles distributed
  in commerce for sale in the United States who willfully fails to affix

  a separate offense.
  `(f) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this section:
  `(1) The term `manufacturer' means any person engaged in the manufacturing or
  assembling of new automobiles, including any person importing new automobiles
  for resale and any person who acts for and is under the control of such
  manufacturer, assembler, or importer in connection with the distribution
  of new automobiles.
  `(2) The term `person' means an individual, partnership, corporation,
  business trust, or any organized group of persons.
  `(3) The term `passenger motor vehicle' has the meaning provided in section
  2(1) of this Act, except that it shall include any multipurpose vehicle and
  light duty truck that is rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.
  `(4) The term `passenger motor vehicle equipment' means any system,
  subassembly, or component received at the final vehicle assembly point
  for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of
  its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an
  ultimate purchaser. The term `component' shall not include minor parts,
  such as attachment hardware (nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces,
  etc.) and such other similar items as the Secretary, in consultation with
  manufacturers and labor, may prescribe by rule.
  `(5) The terms `originated in the United States and Canada', `U.S./Canadian',
  and `of U.S./Canadian origin', in referring to automobile equipment, means--
  `(A) for outside suppliers, the purchase price of automotive equipment which
  contains at least 70 percent value added in the United States and Canada; and
  `(B) for allied suppliers, the manufacturer shall determine the foreign
  content of any passenger motor vehicle equipment supplied by the allied
  supplier by adding up the purchase price of all foreign material purchased
  from outside suppliers that comprise the individual passenger motor vehicle
  equipment and subtracting such purchase price from the total purchase price
  of such equipment. Determination of foreign or U.S./Canadian origin from
  outside suppliers will be consistent with subparagraph (A).
  `(6) The term `new passenger motor vehicle' means a passenger motor vehicle
  the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred by a
  manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser.
  `(7) The term `dealer' means any person or resident located in the United
  States, including any territory of the United States, or the District of
  Columbia, engaged in the sale or the distribution of new automobiles to
  the ultimate purchaser.

  `(9) The term `State' includes each of the several States, the District
  of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands,
  the Canal Zone, and American Samoa.
  `(10)(A) The term `value added in the United States and Canada' means a
  percentage derived as follows:
  `Value added' equals the total purchase price, minus total purchase price
  of foreign content, divided by the total purchase price.
Costs incurred or profits made at the final vehicle assembly point and beyond
(i.e., advertising, assembly, labor, interest payments, profits, etc.) shall
not be included in such calculation.
  `(B) In determining the origin and value added of engines and transmissions,
  the following groupings will be used:
  `(i) Engines of same displacement produced at the same plant.
  `(ii) Transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant.
  `(11) The term `carline' means a name denoting a group of vehicles which
  has a degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis). Carline
  does not consider any level of decor of opulence and is not generally
  distinguished by such characteristics as roof line, number of doors, seats,
  or windows, except for light duty trucks. Light duty trucks are considered
  to be different carlines than passenger cars.
  `(12) The term `country of origin', in referring to the origin of an engine
  or transmission, means the country in which 50 percent or more of the dollar
  value added of an engine or transmission originated. If no country accounts
  for 50 percent or more of the dollar value, then the country of origin is
  the country from which the largest share of the value added originated. The
  estimate of the percentage of the dollar value shall be based upon the
  purchase price of direct materials as received at individual engine or
  transmission plants of engines of the same displacement and transmissions
  of the same transmission type. For the purpose of determining the country
  of origin for engines and transmissions, the United States and Canada
  shall be treated separately.
  `(13) When used in reference to passenger motor vehicle equipment which
  is of U.S./Canadian origin, the term `percentage (by value)' means the
  resulting percentage when the percentage (by value) of such equipment
  not of U.S./Canadian origin that will be installed or included on such
  vehicles produced within a carline is subtracted from 100 percent. Value
  shall be expressed in terms of purchase price. For both outside suppliers
  and allied suppliers the value used shall be the purchase price of the
  passenger motor vehicle equipment as paid at the final assembly point.
  `(14) The term `final assembly' point shall mean the plant, factory, or other
  place at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a
  manufacturer and from which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer
  in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical
  operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle whether or
  not such component parts are permanently installed in or on such vehicle.
  `(15) The term `allied supplier' means a supplier of passenger motor
  vehicle equipment that is wholly owned by the manufacturer, or in the
  case of a joint venture vehicle assembly arrangement, any supplier that
  is wholly owned by one member of the joint venture arrangement.
  `(16) The terms `foreign' or `foreign content' mean passenger motor vehicle
  equipment not determined to be U.S./Canadian origin.
  `(17) The term `outside supplier' means a supplier of passenger motor vehicle
  equipment to a manufacturer's allied supplier or anyone other than an allied
  supplier who ships directly to the manufacturer's final assembly point.
  `(g) EFFECT ON STATE LAW- (1) Whenever a content labeling requirement
  established under this section is in effect, no State or political
  subdivision of a State shall have the authority to adopt or enforce any
  law or regulation relating to the content of vehicles covered by such
  Federal requirement.
  `(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State or
  political subdivision thereof from establishing requirements with respect
