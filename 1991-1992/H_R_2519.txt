 a study of the actuarial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration's

 Mortgage Insurance Fund. The study, using existing studies (including the

 available, shall analyze the actuarial soundness of the Mutual Mortgage
 Insurance Fund and the ability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund to meet

 in the analysis shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
 (1) The actuarial performance of all cohorts of loans insured by the
 Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, including all available post-1985 books
 of business. Specifically, the overall default rates and claims (loss)
 experience of these loans should be considered.
 (2) The effect of the Mortgagor Equity rule issued by the Department of
 Housing and Urban Development, which limits the amount of closing costs
 that can be financed with a Federal Housing Administration mortgage to 57
 percent of the total amount of allowable closing costs, on the actuarial
 status of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, default rates of Federal
 Housing Administration borrowers, the relative impact on purchasers of
 homes at various price levels, and the ability of potential Federal Housing
 Administration borrowers to purchase homes.
 (3) The effect of underwriting changes made by the Federal Housing
 Administration since 1986.
 (4) The effect of the increase in the insurable maximum mortgage amount
 that was made permanent in the National Affordable Housing Act and the
 effect of further increasing the maximum mortgage amount.
 (5) The impact of a policy to allow `streamlined refinancings' whereby the
 borrower would not be required to pay an annual premium.
 (6) The Federal Housing Administration's accounting method for deferring
 and amortizing the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund single-family one-time
 premium revenue.
 (7) The valuation of delinquent loans for loan loss reserve accounting
 purposes.
 (8) The impact of various assumptions regarding the rate of real home price
 appreciation and mortgage interest rates.
 (9) The effect of various economic conditions, including favorable, moderate,
 and adverse conditions, on the ability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance
 Fund to build adequate capital levels.
