H.J.Res.280
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning November 10, 1991, as `Hire a Veteran Week'.
Whereas the people of the  United States have both a deep appreciation and
respect for the men and women who serve our Nation in the armed forces;
Whereas, although veterans possess special qualities and skills which make
them ideal candidates for employment, many veterans encounter difficulties
in securing employment; and
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Labor,
the Office of Personnel Management, and many State and local governments
administer veterans programs and have veterans employment representatives
both to ensure that veterans receive the services to which they are entitled
and to promote employer interest in hiring veterans: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning November 10,
 1991, is hereby designated as `Hire a Veteran Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon employers,
 labor organizations, veterans organizations, and Federal, State, and local
 governmental agencies to lend their support to the campaign to increase
 employment of the men and women who have served our Nation in the armed
 forces.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
