H.J.Res.459
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning July 26, 1992 as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week'.
Whereas Lyme disease (borreliosis) is spread primarily by the bite of four
types of ticks infected with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi;
Whereas Lyme disease-carrying ticks can be found across the country--in woods,
mountains, beaches, even in our yards, and no effective tick control measures
currently exist;
Whereas infected ticks can be carried by animals such as cats, dogs, horses,
cows, goats, birds, and transferred to humans;
Whereas our pets and livestock can be infected with Lyme disease by ticks;
Whereas Lyme disease was first discovered in Europe in 1883 and scientists
have recently proven its presence on Long Island as early as the 1940's;
Whereas Lyme disease was first found in Wisconsin in 1969, and derives its
name from the diagnosis of a cluster of cases in the mid-1970's in Lyme,
Connecticut;
Whereas forty-nine States reported more than 40,000 cases of Lyme disease
from 1982 through 1991;
Whereas Lyme disease knows no season--the peak west coast and southern season
is November to June, the peak east coast and northern season is April to
October, and victims suffer all year round;
Whereas Lyme disease, easily treated soon after the bite with oral antibiotics,
can be difficult to treat (by painful intravenous injections) if not discovered
in time, and for some may be incurable;
Whereas Lyme disease is difficult to diagnose because there is no reliable
test that can directly detect when the infection is present;
Whereas the early symptoms of Lyme disease may include rashes, severe
headaches, fever, fatigue, and swollen glands;
Whereas if left untreated Lyme disease  can affect every body system causing
severe damage to the heart, brain, eyes, joints, lungs, liver, spleen,
blood vessels, and kidneys;
Whereas the bacteria can cross the placenta and affect fetal development;
Whereas our children are the most vulnerable and most widely affected group;
Whereas the best cure for Lyme disease is prevention;
Whereas prevention of Lyme disease  depends upon public awareness; and
Whereas education is essential to making the general public, health care
professionals, employers, and insurers more knowledgeable about Lyme disease
and its debilitating side effects: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning July 26, 1992
 is designated as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
