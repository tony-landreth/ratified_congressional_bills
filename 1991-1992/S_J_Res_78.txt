One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of November 1991 and 1992 as `National Hospice Month'.
Whereas hospice care has been demonstrated to be a humanitarian way for
terminally ill patients to approach the end of their lives in comfort with
appropriate, competent, and compassionate care in an environment of personal
individuality and dignity;
Whereas hospice advocates care for the patient and family by attending to
their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs and specifically, the pain
and grief they experience;
Whereas hospice care is provided by an interdisciplinary team of physicians,
nurses, social workers, pharmacists, psychological and spiritual counselors,
and community volunteers trained in the hospice concept of care;
Whereas hospice is becoming a full partner in the Nation's health care system;
Whereas the enactment of a permanent medicare hospice benefit and an
optional medicaid hospice benefit makes it possible for many more United
States citizens to have the opportunity to elect to receive hospice care;
Whereas private insurance carriers and employers have recognized the value
of hospice care by the inclusion of hospice benefits in health care coverage
packages; and
Whereas there remains a great need to increase public awareness of the
benefits of hospice care: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the month of November in 1991 and
 1992 is designated as `National Hospice Month'. The President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon all government agencies,
 the health care community, appropriate private organizations, and people of
 the United States to observe such months with appropriate forums, programs
 and activities designed to encourage national recognition of and support
 for hospice care as a humane response to the needs of the terminally ill
 and as a viable component of the health care system in the Nation.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
