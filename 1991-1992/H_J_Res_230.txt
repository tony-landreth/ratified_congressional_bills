H.J.Res.230
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating October 16, 1991, and October 16, 1992, each as `World Food Day'.
Whereas hunger and malnutrition remain daily facts of life for hundreds of
millions of people in the world;
Whereas the children of the world suffer the most serious effects of hunger and
malnutrition, with millions of children dying each year from hunger-related
illness and disease, and many others suffering permanent physical or mental
impairment because of vitamin or protein deficiencies;
Whereas the United States has a long tradition of demonstrating humanitarian
concern for the hungry and malnourished people of the world;
Whereas there is growing concern in the United States and in other countries
for environmental protection and the dangers posed to future food security
from misuse and overuse of precious natural resources of land, air, and
water and the subsequent degradation of the biosphere;
Whereas efforts to resolve the world hunger problem are critical to the
maintenance of world peace and, therefore, to the security of the United
States;
Whereas the United States plays a major role in the development and
implementation of interregional food and agricultural trade standards and
practices, and recognizes the positive role that food trade can play in
enhancing human nutrition and in the alleviation of hunger;
Whereas the United States, as the largest producer and trader of food in the
world, plays a key role in assisting countries and people to improve their
ability to feed themselves;
Whereas although progress has been made in reducing the incidence of hunger and
malnutrition in the United States, certain groups, notably Native Americans,
migrant workers, the elderly, the homeless, and children, remain vulnerable
to malnutrition and related diseases;
Whereas the Congress is acutely aware of the paradox of enormous surplus
production capacity in the United States despite the desperate need for food
by people throughout the world;
Whereas the United States and other countries should develop and continually
evaluate national policies concerning food and nutrition to achieve the
well-being and protection of all people and particularly those most vulnerable
to malnutrition and related diseases;
Whereas the Congress is aware and fully supportive of the 1992 World Conference
on Environment and Development and the forthcoming International Conference
on Nutrition, and the influence the decisions of these conferences may have
on sustainable agricultural development and human well-being;
Whereas private enterprise and the primacy of the independent family farmer
have been basic to the development of an agricultural economy in the United
States and have made the United States capable of meeting the food needs of
most of the people of the United States;
Whereas conservation of natural resources is necessary for the United States
to remain the largest producer of food in the world and to continue to aid
hungry and malnourished people of the world;
Whereas participation by private voluntary organizations and businesses,
working with national governments and the international community, is
essential in the search for ways to increase food production in developing
countries and improve food distribution to hungry and malnourished people;
Whereas the member nations of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations unanimously designated October 16 of each year as World Food
Day because of the need to increase public awareness of world hunger problems;
Whereas past observances of World Food Day have been supported by proclamations
by the Congress, the President, the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of
the United States, and by programs of the Department of Agriculture, other
Federal departments and agencies, and the governments and peoples of more
than 140 other nations;
Whereas nearly 450 private voluntary organizations and thousands of community
leaders are participating in the planning of World Food Day observances in
1991, and a growing number of these organizations and leaders are using such
day as a focal point for year-round programs; and
Whereas the people of the United States can express their concern for the
plight of hungry and malnourished people throughout the world by fasting
and donating food and money for such people: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 16, 1991, and October
 16, 1992, are each designated as `World Food Day', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe World Food Day with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities, including worship services, fasting, education endeavors,
 and the establishment of year-round food and health programs and policies.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
