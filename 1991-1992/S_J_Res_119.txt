S.J.Res.119
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate April 22, 1991, as `Earth Day' to promote the preservation of
the global
environment.
Whereas the world faces an international environmental crisis which demands
the attention of citizens of every nation of the world, including the United
States, so that alliances can be built that transcend the boundaries dividing
countries, continents, and cultures;
Whereas there is a need to confront environmental problems of increasing
severity, including climate change, depletion of the stratospheric ozone
layer, loss of forests, wetlands, and other wildlife habitats, acid rain,
air pollution, ocean pollution, and hazardous and solid waste buildup;
Whereas it is important that the next generation be guided by a conservation
ethic in all of its relations with nature;
Whereas education and understanding is necessary for individuals to recognize
the environmental impact of daily living and to become environmentally
responsible consumers by conserving energy, increasing recycling efforts,
and promoting environmental responsibility in communities;
Whereas major public policy initiatives are necessary to cure the causes
of environmental degradation, such as eliminating the manufacture and use
of chlorofluorocarbons, minimizing and recycling solid wastes, improving
energy efficiency, protecting biodiversity, promoting reforestation, and
initiating sustainable development throughout the world;
Whereas nearly 21 years ago, millions of individuals in the United States
joined together on Earth Day to express an unprecedented  concern for the
environment, and such collective action resulted in the passage of sweeping
laws to protect the air, water, and land;
Whereas the 1990's should be observed as the `International Environmental
Decade' in order to forge an international alliance in response to global
environmental problems; and
Whereas to inaugurate the new environmental decade, individuals should again
stand together in cities, towns, and villages around the world for a day of
collective action to declare a shared resolve: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 22, 1991 is designated as
 `Earth Day', and the people of the United States are called upon to observe
 the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities in our grade schools,
 high schools, colleges and local communities with the objective of making
 every day Earth Day.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
