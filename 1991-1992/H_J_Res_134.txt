Joint Resolution
To designate the weeks of April 14 through 21, 1991, and May 3 through 10,

Whereas April 18, 1991, and May 7, 1992 mark the forty-third and forty-fourth
anniversaries of the founding of the State of Israel;
Whereas the months of April and May contain events of major significance
in the Jewish calendar, including Passover, the anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising, Holocaust Memorial Day, and Jerusalem Day;
Whereas the Congress recognizes that an understanding of the heritage of
all ethnic groups in this Nation contributes to the unity of this Nation; and
Whereas understanding among ethnic groups in this Nation may be fostered
further through an appreciation of the culture, history, and traditions of
the Jewish community and the contributions of Jewish people to this Nation:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the weeks of April 14 through 21, 1991,
 and May 3 through 10, 1992, are designated as `Jewish Heritage Week', and

 upon the people of the United States, departments and agencies of State
 and local governments, and interested organizations to observe such week
 with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
