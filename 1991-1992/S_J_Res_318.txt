Joint Resolution
Designating November 13, 1992, as `Vietnam Veterans Memorial
10th Anniversary Day'.
Whereas on November 13, 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated
in honor and recognition of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the
United States who served in the Vietnam War, particularly those who gave
their lives or who remain missing;
Whereas the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, located on a site in West Potomac Park
in the District of Columbia near the Lincoln Memorial as authorized by Public
Law 96-297, was constructed with funds raised entirely from private sources;
Whereas this memorial, bearing the names of 58,183 men and women, has become
the most visited memorial in the Nation's capital;
Whereas November 13, 1992, marks the 10th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, a milestone which will be observed during 1992 through educational
seminars, a reading of the names on the Wall, veterans reunions, and other
appropriate events;
Whereas this anniversary offers an opportunity for the entire country to
reflect on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and its role in healing the Nation's
wounds from the Vietnam era; and
Whereas the anniversary will enable new generations to discuss lessons
learned in the decade since the Memorial's dedication: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That November 13, 1992, is designated
  as `Vietnam Veterans Memorial 10th Anniversary Day', and the President is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the
  United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
