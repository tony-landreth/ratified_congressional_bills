One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating August 29, 1991, as `National Sarcoidosis Awareness Day'.
Whereas sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown causes that can affect
any part of the body;
Whereas sarcoidosis affects between 20 and 50 individuals in 100,000 in the
United States;
Whereas most victims of the disease range in age between 20 and 40 years,
with blacks being affected at least 10 times more often than other ethnic
groups in the United States;
Whereas between 10 to 20 percent of individuals stricken with sarcoidosis
eventually develop serious disabling conditions caused by damage to vital
organs, such as lungs, heart, and central nervous system;
Whereas sarcoidosis is an enigma in the realm of medicine and disease that
requires extensive and ongoing study and research in an effort to develop
an effective treatment and eventually a cure;
Whereas individuals with sarcoidosis and family members across the United
States are seeking treatment and support services to assist in controlling
the effects of the disease;
Whereas grassroot support groups and nonprofit organizations are forming
across the United States to encourage public awareness of the mysterious
and debilitating disease;
Whereas the Federal Government has a responsibility to lead a nationwide
effort to find a cure for the disabling disease; and
Whereas the Federal Government should make research into the causes of the
life-threatening ailment a greater priority and provide the public with more
information about potential treatments for individuals with sarcoidosis:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That August 29, 1991, is designated as
 `National Sarcoidosis Awareness Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
