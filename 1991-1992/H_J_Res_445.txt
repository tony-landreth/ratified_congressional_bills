One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating June 1992 as `National Scleroderma Awareness Month'.
Whereas scleroderma is a disease caused by the excess production of collagen,
the main fibrous component of connective tissue, causing hardening of the
skin or internal organs such as the esophagus, lungs, kidney, and heart;
Whereas approximately 300,000 people in the United States suffer from
scleroderma with women of childbearing age outnumbering men four to one;
Whereas scleroderma is a painful, crippling, and disfiguring disease that
is usually progressive and can result in premature death;
Whereas the symptoms of scleroderma are variable, and this variability can
complicate and confuse diagnosis of the disease;
Whereas the cause and cure of scleroderma are unknown; and
Whereas scleroderma is an orphan disease for which intensive research is
needed to improve treatment and find its cause and cure: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That June 1992 is designated as `National
 Scleroderma Awareness Month'. The President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe
 the month with appropriate activities to enhance awareness of the disease
 and the need for a cure.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
