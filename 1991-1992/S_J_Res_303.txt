S.J.Res. 303
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate October 1992 as `National Breast Cancer Awareness Month'.
Whereas breast cancer will strike an estimated 180,000 women and 1,000 men
in the United States in 1992;
Whereas, assuming an average life expectancy of 85 years, a woman's lifetime
risk of developing breast cancer is 1 in 9;
Whereas the risk of developing breast cancer increases as a woman grows older;
Whereas breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women,
and will kill an estimated 46,000 women and 300 men in 1992;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has risen from
78 percent in the 1940s to over 90 percent today;
Whereas most breast cancers are detected by the woman herself;
Whereas educating both the public and health care providers about the
importance of early detection will result in reducing breast cancer mortality;
Whereas appropriate use of screening mammography, in conjunction with clinical
examination and breast self-examination, can result in the detection of many
breast cancers early in their development and increase the survival rate to
nearly 100 percent;
Whereas data from controlled trials clearly demonstrate that deaths from
breast cancer are significantly reduced in women over the age of 40 by using
mammography as a screening tool;
Whereas many women are reluctant to have screening mammograms for a variety
of reasons, such as the cost of testing, lack of information, or fear;
Whereas access to screening mammography is directly related to socioeconomic
status;
Whereas increased awareness about the importance of screening mammography
will result in the procedure being regularly requested by the patient and
recommended by the health care provider; and
Whereas it is projected that more women will use this lifesaving test as it
becomes increasingly available and affordable: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That October 1992 is designated as
  `National Breast Cancer Awareness Month', and the President is authorized
  and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
  States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
