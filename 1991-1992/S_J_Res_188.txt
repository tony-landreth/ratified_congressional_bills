Joint Resolution
Designating November 1991 as `National Red Ribbon Month'.
Whereas the most frequently committed crime in America is drunk driving;
Whereas each year on our Nation's highways more than forty-five thousand
people lose their lives due to auto crashes, approximately half of these
involving alcohol;
Whereas more than three hundred and forty-five thousand people are injured
in alcohol-related crashes each year;
Whereas Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is an organization of nearly
three million members and supporters across the Nation which has had a major
impact on reducing death on our highways;
Whereas in November 1991 MADD will launch a major holiday public awareness
campaign by asking America to `Tie One On For Safety' this holiday season; and
Whereas beginning in November MADD and other concerned groups will distribute
more than ninety million red ribbons nationwide to create awareness about
the dangers of drinking and driving: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That November 1991 is designated as `National
 Red Ribbon Month', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the
 month with appropriate activities devoted to reducing death and injury on
 our Nation's highways due to drinking and driving.
