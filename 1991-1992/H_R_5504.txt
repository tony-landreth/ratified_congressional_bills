  backfit the first eight Trident submarines with Trident II missiles
  versus their continuation with Trident I missiles, taking into account
  such factors as inflation, appropriate regulations such as OMB Circular

  substantially greater than Minutemen III refurbishment.
  (6) The reasons why strategic missile flight testing rates are substantially
  different for the Navy and Air Force, along with recommendations for
  uniform testing rates.

  Sacramento and American Rivers, California, as described in the feasibility
  report of the Chief of Engineers, entitled the `American River Watershed
  Investigation', dated July 1, 1992, subject to the provisions of this
  section.
  (b) NATOMAS LEVEE FEATURES-
  (1) CONSTRUCTION- The Secretary of the Army is authorized and directed to
  construct the Natomas levee features of the project as described in the
  feasibility report referred to in subsection (a), subject to entering into
  appropriate local cost-sharing agreements from the non-Federal sponsors
  of the project, provided that such construction does not encourage the
  development of deep floodplains.
  (2) CREDIT FOR CERTAIN NON-FEDERAL WORK- The Secretary of the Army shall
  credit against the non-Federal share of the cost of construction under
  paragraph (1), or reimburse the non-Federal sponsors, for any planning and
  construction work performed by the non-Federal sponsors to protect the
  Natomas area which is commenced prior to the Army Corps of Engineers'
  receiving appropriations to initiate such construction and which is
  consistent with the feasibility report referred to in subsection (a).
  (c) GATING AND EXPANDABILITY REPORT- In carrying out the reevaluation
  described in subsection (a) and in consultation with the State of California,
  the local non-Federal sponsors, and other interested groups, the Secretary
  of the Army is directed, within one year after the date of the enactment

  (1) analyzes the outlet design of the flood control dam proposed as a
  feature of the project referred to in subsection (a), including an analysis
  of various configurations and capacities of gates (including a completely
  ungated configuration, a partly ungated configuration, emergency gates,
  operational gates, or a combination thereof) to ensure the safety of
  the flood control dam itself, to provide for system safety, to minimize
  small event flooding of the Auburn Canyon, and to minimize damages to the
  vegetation, soils, and habitat in the canyon; and
  (2) includes further analysis as to whether any feature or characteristic
  of the flood control dam would preclude its efficient expansion for
  water, power, or other purposes, and whether the design would create any
  greater difficulty for an expanded dam to meet seismic requirements than
  a multipurpose dam would otherwise encounter, and further assessment of
  the extra costs attributable to installation into an expanded dam such
  penstocks, operational gates and other features of a multipurpose dam
  which would not be included in an expandable dam lacking advanced features.
  (d) REPAYMENT OF DESIGN WORK- The non-Federal share of the costs of the
  design and reevaluations described in subsection (a) shall not be required
  to be repaid until after the execution of the agreement required by section
  103(j) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 and immediately
  prior to the initiation of construction of the project or the appropriate
  separable element.
  (e) SPECIAL EVALUATION REPORTS-
  (1) In carrying out the reevaluation described in subsection (a) and in
  consultation with the State of California, the local non-Federal sponsors,
  and other interested groups, the Secretary of the Army shall perform further
  evaluation of, and, within twelve months after the date of the enactment
  of this Act, submit to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of
  the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public
  Works of the Senate a report on, other features and operational procedures
  that should be implemented in a coordinated plan to provide flood protection
  sufficiently high for a major urban area subject to risk of frequent floods
  causing great economic, environmental, and social damage. The report shall
  specifically address, at a minimum, the following:
  (i) The reliability, costs, environmental impacts, and public safety
  risks associated with increasing objective flows in the Lower American
  River above the 115,000 cubic feet per second design capacity, as well
  as the costs and impacts of permanent reoperation of Folsom Reservoir at
  different levels of increased flood storage, including the appropriate
  alternatives for sharing costs associated with Folsom Dam.
  (ii) The costs and benefits of lowering the spillway at Folsom Dam in
  order to improve the dam's ability to pass a maximum probable flood and
  improve its operational flexibility for flood control.
  (iii) The costs and benefits of transferring flood control obligations
  from the Folsom Reservoir to a new flood control facility at Auburn,
  increasing the Folsom Reservoir's capability for water supply.
  (iv) The costs and benefits of utilizing existing and increased flood
  space in the upstream reservoirs to enhance the flood control capability
  at Folsom Dam and of establishing offstream storage in Deer Creek, alone
  or in combination with the alternatives referenced in paragraphs (i) and
  (ii) of this subsection.
  (2) The Secretary of the Army shall further consult with, and solicit
  the views of, the National Academy of Engineering on the contingency
  assumptions, hydrological methodologies used in the preparation of
  the American River Project, and other engineering assumptions and
  methodologies influencing the scope and formulation of the American River
  flood control alternatives. Such consultation shall also solicit the views
  of the National Academy of Engineering on the merits of normalized use of
  reservoir surcharge space in a flood control regime for Sacramento. Any
  opinions with respect to these and other issues rendered by the National
  Academy of Engineering shall be made available to the public and included
  in the reports transmitted to Congress pursuant to this section.
  (f) Folsom Dam-
  (1) IN GENERAL- Congress recognizes the urgency of ensuring that Folsom
  Dam is operated correctly, safely, efficiently and prudently for flood
  control purposes. The Secretary of the Interior (in consultation with
  the Sacramento Flood Control Agency and the Secretary of the Army) shall
  operate Folsom Dam to provide the maximum level of flood protection.
  (2) FLOOD MANAGEMENT PLAN- (A) Not later than one year after the date of
  enactment of this Act, and consistent with existing law, the Secretaries of
  the Army and Interior shall jointly develop and implement a flood management
  plan for the American River and Folsom Dam that ensures prompt, reliable,
  and full utilization of the flood control capability at Folsom Dam and other
  existing water resources development projects located in the American River
  watershed, California. Consistent with existing law, the plan should maximize
  the flood control capability within Folsom Dam's flood space reservation. The
  plan shall also identify opportunities and make recommendations to improve
  the stream gauge network and flood forecast system for the upper American
  River watershed. The Plan should also recognize that reservoir releases
  need to be made as quickly as possible in anticipation of incoming flow
  and in accordance with existing documents: `1959 Reservoir Regulations,
  Appendix II, the Corps Master Manual, Sacramento River Basin Reservoir
  Regulation Manual, Folsom Dam/Reservoir, American River: October 1, 1956,'
  revised March 1959.
  (B) The components of the inflow forecasting system and revised flood
  release rules and practices, and hydrographic and flood frequency models
  shall give due deference to the National Academy of Engineering findings
  developed pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this section.
