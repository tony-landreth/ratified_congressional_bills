S.J.Res. 287
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of October 4, 1992, through October 10, 1992, as `Mental
Illness Awareness Week'.
Whereas mental illness is a problem of grave concern and consequence in the
United States and it is widely, but unnecessarily, feared and misunderstood;
Whereas on an annual basis 40,000,000 adults in the United States suffer
from clearly diagnosable mental disorders, including mental illness, alcohol
abuse, and drug abuse, which create significant disabilities with respect
to employment, school attendance, and independent living;
Whereas more than 17,000,000 United States citizens are disabled for long
periods of time by schizophrenia, manic depressive disorder, and major
depression;
Whereas 33 percent of homeless persons suffer serious, chronic forms of
mental illness;
Whereas alcohol, drug, and mental disorders affect almost 22 percent of
adults in the United States in any 1-year period;
Whereas mental illness interferes with the development and maturation of at
least 12,000,000 of our children;
Whereas a majority of the 29,000 American citizens who commit suicide each
year suffer from a mental or an addictive disorder;
Whereas our growing population of elderly persons faces many obstacles to
care for mental disorders;
Whereas 20 to 25 percent of AIDS patients will develop AIDS-related
cognitive dysfunction and as many as two-thirds of AIDS patients will show
neuropsychiatric symptoms before they die;
Whereas mental illnesses, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse result in staggering
costs to society, estimated to be in excess of $249,000,000,000 in direct
treatment and support and indirect costs to society, including lost
productivity;
Whereas the Federal research budget committed to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration represents only about 1 percent of the
direct treatment and support costs of caring for persons with alcohol, drug,
and mental disorders;
Whereas mental illnesses are increasingly treatable disorders with excellent
prospects for amelioration when properly recognized;
Whereas mentally ill persons and their families have begun to join self-help
groups seeking to combat the unfair stigma of mental illness, to support
greater national investment in research, and to advocate an adequate continuum
of care from hospital to community;
Whereas in recent years there have been unprecedented major research
developments bringing new methods and technology to the sophisticated and
objective study of the functioning of the brain and its linkages to both
normal and abnormal behavior;
Whereas research in recent decades has led to a wide array of new and more
effective modalities of treatment (somatic, psychosocial, and service delivery)
for some of the most incapacitating forms of mental illness, including
schizophrenia, major affective disorders, phobias, and phobic disorders;
Whereas appropriate treatment of mental illness has been demonstrated to
be cost effective in terms of restored productivity, reduced use of other
health services, and lessened social dependence; and
Whereas recent and unparalleled growth in scientific knowledge about mental
illness has generated the current emergence of a new threshold of opportunity
for future research advances and fruitful application to specific clinical
problems: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 4, 1992,
  through October 10, 1992, is designated as `Mental Illness Awareness Week'.
  The President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
  upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
  programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
