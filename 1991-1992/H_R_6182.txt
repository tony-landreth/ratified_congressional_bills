  `(B) ACTIVITIES- For the purposes of this section, the activities of a
  facility include the operation of equipment to produce the mammogram,
  the processing of the film, the initial interpretation of the mammogram
  and the viewing conditions for that interpretation. Where procedures
  such as the film processing, or the interpretation of the mammogram are
  performed in a location different from where the mammogram is performed,
  the facility performing the mammogram shall be responsible for meeting
  the quality standards described in subsection (f).
  `(4) INSPECTION- The term `inspection' means an onsite evaluation of the
  facility by the Secretary, or State agency on behalf of the Secretary.
  `(5) MAMMOGRAM- The term `mammogram' means a radiographic image produced
  through mammography.
  `(6) MAMMOGRAPHY- The term `mammography' means radiography of the breast.
  `(7) SURVEY- The term `survey' means an onsite physics consultation and
  evaluation performed by a medical physicist as described in subsection
  (f)(1)(E).
  `(b) CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENT-
  `(1) CERTIFICATE- No facility may conduct an examination or procedure
  described in paragraph (2) involving mammography after October 1, 1994,
  unless the facility obtains--
  `(A) a certificate--
  `(i) that is issued, and, if applicable, renewed, by the Secretary in
  accordance with subsection (c)(1);
  `(ii) that is applicable to the examination or procedure to be conducted; and

  effect no longer than 6 months from the date it is issued, except that it
  may be extended once for a period of not more than 90 days if the owner,
  lessor, or agent of the facility demonstrates to the Secretary that without
  such extension access to mammography in the geographic area served by the
  facility would be significantly reduced and if the owner, lessor, or agent
  of the facility will describe in a report to the Secretary steps that will
  be taken to qualify the facility for certification under subsection (b)(1).
  `(d) APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE-
  `(1) SUBMISSION- The Secretary may issue or renew a certificate for a
  facility if--

  may bring suit in the district court of the United States for the district
  in which the facility is situated to enjoin continuation of the activity; and
  `(2) a facility is operating without a certificate as required by subsection
  (b), the Secretary may bring suit in the district court of the United
  States for the district in which the facility is situated to enjoin the
  operation of the facility.
Upon a proper showing, the district court shall grant a temporary injunction
or restraining order against continuation of the activity or against operation
of a facility, as the case may be, without requiring the Secretary to post
a bond, pending issuance of a final order under this subsection.
  `(k) JUDICIAL REVIEW-

  subsection (h) or suspends or revokes the certificate of a facility under
  subsection (i), the owner or operator of the facility may, not later
  than 60 days after the date the action of the Secretary becomes final,
  file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit
  in which the facility is situated for judicial review of the action. As
  soon as practicable after receipt of the petition, the clerk of the court
  shall transmit a copy of the petition to the Secretary or other officer
  designated by the Secretary. As soon as practicable after receipt of the
  copy, the Secretary shall file in the court the record on which the action
  of the Secretary is based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United
  States Code.
  `(2) ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE- If the petitioner applies to the court for leave
  to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court
  that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable
  grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before
  the Secretary, the court may order the additional evidence (and evidence
  in rebuttal of the additional evidence) to be taken before the Secretary,
  and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms
  and conditions as the court may determine to be proper. The Secretary may
  modify the findings of the Secretary as to the facts, or make new findings,
  by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and the Secretary shall file
  the modified or new findings, and the recommendations of the Secretary,
  if any, for the modification or setting aside of the original action of
  the Secretary with the return of the additional evidence.
  `(3) JUDGMENT OF COURT- Upon the filing of the petition referred to in
  paragraph (1), the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action, or to
  set the action aside in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently. The
  findings of the Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial
  evidence, shall be conclusive.
