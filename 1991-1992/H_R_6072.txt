An Act
To direct expedited negotiated settlement of the land rights of the Kenai
Natives Association, Inc., under section 14(h)(3) of the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act, by directing land acquisition and exchange negotiations by
the Secretary of the Interior and certain Alaska Native corporations involving
lands and interests in lands held by the United States and such corporations.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That during the 6-month period beginning
  on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall
  engage in expedited negotiation with the Kenai Natives Association, Inc.,
  and Cook Inlet Region, Inc., for independent voluntary exchange agreements
  or land acquisition agreements through which the United States would acquire
  all of the surface estate in parcels of high public interest held by such
  private parties, including lands along the Kenai River and Moose River. Any
  negotiation (and agreements) shall consider the value of recreational
  resources and wildlife habitat of such lands being exchanged or acquired
  and their importance to the purposes and management of public lands, shall
  consider independent third party appraisals which include such values,
  and shall not include values for lands retained by such corporations to
  which they already have title. The Secretary should, within 60 days of the
  end of the negotiation period, submit to Congress legislation approving the
  exchanges or acquisitions, or in the event that the parties do not agree,
  submit a report to Congress describing the reasons why agreement was not
  reached including the values relied upon by the Kenai Natives Association,
  Inc., the Cook Inlet Region, Inc., and the Secretary, and the Secretary's
  justification of any differential between the values arrived at by the Kenai
  Natives Association, Inc., the Cook Inlet Region, Inc., and the Secretary.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
