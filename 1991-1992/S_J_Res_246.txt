S.J.Res.246
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate April 15, 1992 as `National Recycling Day'.
Whereas the United States generates over 180 million tons of municipal solid
waste each year--almost double the amount produced in 1965, and amounting
to about 4 pounds per person per day--and the amount is expected to increase
to 216 million tons of garbage annually by the year 2000;
Whereas the continued generation of enormous volumes of solid waste each
year presents unacceptable threats to human health and the environment;
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency expects that 27 States will run
out of landfill capacity for municipal solid waste within 5 years and that
a large percentage of currently operating landfills will close by the year
2000 either because they are filled or because their design and operation
do not meet Federal or State standards for protection of human health and
the environment, requiring that waste now disposed of in these facilities
will have to be disposed through other means;
Whereas a significant amount of waste can be diverted from disposal by the
utilization of source separation, mechanical separation and community-based
recycling programs;
Whereas recycling can save energy, reduce our dependence on foreign oil,
has substantial materials conservation benefits and can prevent the pollution
created from extracting resources from their natural environment;
Whereas the revenues recovered by recycling programs offset the costs of solid
waste management and some communities have established recycling programs
which provide significant economic benefits to members of the community;
Whereas the current level of municipal solid waste recycling in the United
States is low, although some communities have set a much higher rate;
Whereas to reach a goal of increased recycling, more materials need to be
separated, collected, processed, marketed and manufactured into new products;
Whereas a well-developed system exists for recycling scrap metals, aluminum
cans, glass and metal containers, paper and paperboard, and is reducing the
quantity of waste entering landfills or incinerators and saving manufacturers
energy costs;
Whereas recycling of plastics is in the early stages of development and
considerable market potential exists to increase the recycling;
Whereas yard and food waste is an important part of municipal solid waste
and a large potential exists for mulching and composting the waste which
would save both landfill space and nourish soil, but only small amounts of
this material is currently being recycled;
Whereas Federal, State and local governments should enact legislative measures
that will increase the amount of solid waste that is recycled;
Whereas Federal, State and local governments should encourage the development
of markets for recyclable goods;
Whereas Federal, State and local governments should promote the design of
products that can be recycled safely and efficiently;
Whereas the success of recycling programs depends on the ability of informed
consumers and businesses to make decisions regarding recycling and recycled
products and to participate in recycling programs; and
Whereas the people of the United States should be encouraged to participate
in educational, organizational and legislative endeavors that promote
waste separation methods, community-based recycling programs and expanded
utilization of recovered materials: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 15, 1992, is designated as
 `National Recycling Day'. The President of the United States is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
 States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
