Joint Resolution
Designating January 16, 1993, as `Religious Freedom Day'.
Whereas December 15, 1991, is the 200th anniversary of the completion of
the ratification of the Bill of Rights;
Whereas the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees
religious liberty to the people of the United States;
Whereas millions of people from all parts of the world have come to the
United States fleeing religious persecution and seeking freedom to worship;
Whereas in 1777 Thomas Jefferson wrote the bill entitled `A Bill for
Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia' to guarantee freedom of conscience
and separation of church and state;
Whereas in 1786, through the devotion of Virginians such as George Mason
and James Madison, the General Assembly of Virginia passed such bill;
Whereas the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom inspired and shaped
the guarantees of religious freedom in the first amendment;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized repeatedly that
the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom was an important influence in
the development of the Bill of Rights;
Whereas scholars across the United States have proclaimed the vital importance
of such statute and leaders in fields such as law and religion have devoted
time, energy, and resources to celebrating its contribution to international
freedom; and
Whereas America's First Freedom Center, located in Richmond, Virginia,
plans a permanent monument to the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom,
accompanied by educational programs and commemorative activities for visitors
from around the world: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That January 16, 1993, is designated as
