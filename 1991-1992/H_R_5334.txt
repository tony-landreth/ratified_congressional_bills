  dwelling unit in the project may not be evicted or otherwise required to

  this subsection.

  administrative changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws and
  substantial improvements in the Nation's understanding of discrimination
  in the housing markets;
  (2) in response to evidence of continuing housing discrimination, the
  Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, to provide for
  more effective enforcement of fair housing rights through judicial and
  administrative avenues and to expand the number of protected classes
  covered under Federal fair housing laws;
  (3) in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
  of 1989, the Congress expanded the disclosure provisions under the Home
  Mortgage Disclosure Act to provide increased information on the mortgage
  lending patterns of financial institutions;
  (4) in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Congress provided
  a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of
  discrimination against individuals with disabilities;
  (5) in 1991, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
  disclosed evidence of pervasive discrimination in the Nation's mortgage
  lending markets;
  (6) the Housing Discrimination Survey, released by the Department of Housing
  and Urban Development in 1991, found that Hispanic and African-American
  homeseekers experience some form of discrimination in at least half of
  their encounters with sales and rental agents;
  (7) the Fair Housing Initiatives Program should be revised and expanded
  to reflect the significant changes in the fair housing and fair lending
  area that have taken place since the Program's initial authorization in
  the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987;
  (8) continuing educational efforts by the real estate industry are a useful
  way to increase understanding by the public of their fair housing rights
  and responsibilities; and
  (9) the proven efficacy of private nonprofit fair housing enforcement
  organizations and community-based efforts makes support for these
  organizations a necessary component of the fair housing enforcement system.

TITLE X--RESIDENTIAL LEAD-BASED PAINT HAZARD REDUCTION ACT OF 1992
SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE.
  This title may be cited as the `Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard
  Reduction Act of 1992'.
SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) low-level lead poisoning is widespread among American children,
  afflicting as many as 3,000,000 children under age 6, with minority and
  low-income communities disproportionately affected;
  (2) at low levels, lead poisoning in children causes intelligence quotient
  deficiencies, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced
  attention span, hyperactivity, and behavior problems;
  (3)  pre-1980 American housing stock contains more than 3,000,000 tons
  of lead in the form of lead-based paint, with the vast majority of homes
  built before 1950 containing substantial amounts of lead-based paint;
  (4) the ingestion of household dust containing lead from deteriorating
  or abraded lead-based paint is the most common cause of lead poisoning
  in children;
  (5) the health and development of children living in as many as 3,800,000
  American homes is endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive
  amounts of lead-contaminated dust in their homes;
  (6) the danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be reduced by abating
  lead-based paint or by taking interim measures to prevent paint deterioration
  and limit children's exposure to lead dust and chips;
  (7) despite the enactment of laws in the early 1970's requiring the Federal
  Government to eliminate as far as practicable lead-based paint hazards in
  federally owned, assisted, and insured housing, the Federal response to
  this national crisis remains severely limited; and
  (8) the Federal Government must take a leadership role in building the
  infrastructure--including an informed public, State and local delivery
  systems, certified inspectors, contractors, and laboratories, trained
  workers, and available financing and insurance--necessary to ensure that
  the national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing can
  be achieved as expeditiously as possible.
SEC. 1003.  PURPOSES.
  The purposes of this Act are--
  (1) to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary
  to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously
  as possible;
  (2) to reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint
  in housing to implement, on a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate
  and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation's housing stock;
  (3) to encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by
  establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation
  and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards
  of care;
  (4) to ensure that the existence of lead-based paint hazards is taken into
  account in the development of Government housing policies and in the sale,
  rental, and renovation of homes and apartments;
  (5) to mobilize national resources expeditiously, through a partnership
  among all levels of government and the private sector, to develop the most
  promising, cost-effective methods for evaluating and reducing lead-based
  paint hazards;
  (6) to reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing owned,
  assisted, or transferred by the Federal Government; and
  (7) to educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead-based
  paint poisoning and steps to reduce and eliminate such hazards.

SEC. 1302. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan
  Mortgage Corporation (referred to in this section collectively as the
  `enterprises'), and the Federal Home Loan Banks (referred to in this section
  as the `Banks'), have important public missions that are reflected in the
  statutes and charter Acts establishing the Banks and the enterprises;
  (2) because the continued ability of the Federal National Mortgage
  Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to accomplish
  their public missions is important to providing housing in the United
  States and the health of the Nation's economy, more effective Federal
  regulation is needed to reduce the risk of failure of the enterprises;
  (3) considering the current operating procedures of the Federal National
  Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and the
  Federal Home Loan Banks, the enterprises and the Banks currently pose low
  financial risk of insolvency;
  (4) neither the enterprises nor the Banks, nor any securities or obligations
  issued by the enterprises or the Banks, are backed by the full faith and
  credit of the United States;
  (5) an entity regulating the Federal National Mortgage Association and
  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation should have sufficient autonomy
  from the enterprises and special interest groups;
  (6) an entity regulating such enterprises should have the authority to
  establish capital standards, require financial disclosure, prescribe
  adequate standards for books and records and other internal controls,
  conduct examinations when necessary, and enforce compliance with the
  standards and rules that it establishes;
  (7) the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan
  Mortgage Corporation have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the
  financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in
  a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining
  a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return; and
  (8) the Federal Home Loan Bank Act should be amended to emphasize that
  providing for financial safety and soundness of the Federal Home Loan
  Banks is the primary mission of the Federal Housing Finance Board.

Subtitle B--Required Capital Levels for Enterprises and Special Enforcement
Powers
SEC. 1361. RISK-BASED CAPITAL LEVELS.
  (a) RISK-BASED CAPITAL TEST- The Director shall, by regulation, establish a
  risk-based capital test under this section for the enterprises. When applied
  to an enterprise, the risk-based capital test shall determine the amount
  of total capital for the enterprise that is sufficient for the enterprise
  to maintain positive capital during a 10-year period in which the following
  circumstances occur (in this section referred to as the `stress period'):
  (1) CREDIT RISK- With respect to mortgages owned or guaranteed by
  the enterprise and other obligations of the enterprise, losses occur
  throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity (based
  on any measurements of default reasonably related to prevailing practice
  for that industry in determining capital adequacy) reasonably related to
  the rate and severity that occurred in contiguous areas of the United
  States containing an aggregate of not less than 5 percent of the total
  population of the United States that, for a period of not less than 2 years,
  experienced the highest rates of default and severity of mortgage losses,
  in comparison with such rates of default and severity of mortgage losses
  in other such areas for any period of such duration.
  (2) INTEREST RATE RISK-
  (A) IN GENERAL- Interest rates decrease as described in subparagraph (B)
  or increase as described in subparagraph (C), whichever would require more
  capital for the enterprise.
  (B) DECREASES- The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield decreases during
  the first year of the stress period and will remain at the new level for
  the remainder of the stress period. The yield decreases to the lesser of--
  (i) 600 basis points below the average yield during the preceding 9
  months, or
  (ii) 60 percent of the average yield during the preceding 3 years,
but in no case to a yield less than 50 percent of the average yield during
the preceding 9 months.
  (C) INCREASES- The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield increases during
  the first year of the stress period and will remain at the new level for
  the remainder of the stress period. The yield increases to the greater of--
  (i) 600 basis points above the average yield during the preceding 9
  months, or
  (ii) 160 percent of the average yield during the preceding 3 years,
but in no case to a yield greater than 175 percent of the average yield
during the preceding 9 months.
  (D) DIFFERENT TERMS TO MATURITY- Yields of Treasury instruments with other
  terms to maturity will change relative to the 10-year constant maturity
  Treasury yield in patterns and for durations that are reasonably related
  to historical experience and are judged reasonable by the Director.
  (E) LARGE INCREASES IN YIELDS- If the 10-year constant maturity Treasury
  yield is assumed to increase by more than 50 percent over the average
  yield during the preceding 9 months, the Director shall adjust the losses
  in paragraphs (1) and (3) to reflect a correspondingly higher rate of
  general price inflation.
  (3) NEW BUSINESS-
  (A) IN GENERAL- Any contractual commitments of the enterprise to purchase
  mortgages or issue securities will be fulfilled. The characteristics of
  resulting mortgage purchases, securities issued, and other financing will be
  consistent with the contractual terms of such commitments, recent experience,
  and the economic characteristics of the stress period. No other purchases
  of mortgages shall be assumed, except as provided in subparagraph (B).
  (B) ADDITIONAL NEW BUSINESS- The Director may, after consideration of each
  of the studies required by subparagraph (C), assume that the enterprise
  conducts additional new business during the stress period consistent with
  the following--
  (i) AMOUNT AND PRODUCT TYPES- The amount and types of mortgages purchased
  and their financing will be reasonably related to recent experience and
  the economic characteristics of the stress period.
  (ii) LOSSES- Default and loss severity characteristics of mortgages
  purchased will be reasonably related to historical experience.
  (iii) PRICING- Prices charged by the enterprise in purchasing new
  mortgages will be reasonably related to recent experience and the
  economic characteristics of the stress period. The Director may assume
  that a reasonable period of time would lapse before the enterprise would
  recognize and react to the characteristics of the stress period.
  (iv) INTEREST RATE RISK- Interest rate risk on new mortgages purchased
  will occur to an extent reasonably related to historical experience.
  (v) RESERVES- The enterprise must maintain reserves during and at the end
  of the stress period on new business conducted during the first 5 years
  of the stress period reasonably related to the expected future losses on
  such business, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles
  and industry accounting practice.
  (C) STUDIES- Within 1 year after regulations are first issued under
  subsection (e), the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and the
  Comptroller General of the United States shall each submit to the Committee
  on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on
  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives a study
  of the advisability and appropriate form of any new business assumptions
  under subparagraph (B).
  (D) EFFECTIVE DATE- The provisions of subparagraph (B) shall become
  effective 4 years after regulations are first issued under subsection (e).
  (4) OTHER ACTIVITIES- Losses or gains on other activities, including
  interest rate and foreign exchange hedging activities, shall be determined
  by the Director, on the basis of available information, to be consistent
  with the stress period.
  (b) CONSIDERATIONS-
  (1) IN GENERAL- In establishing the risk-based capital test under subsection
  (a), the Director shall take into account appropriate distinctions among
  types of mortgage products, differences in seasoning of mortgages, and
  any other factors the Director considers appropriate.
  (2) CONSISTENCY- Characteristics of the stress period other than those
  specifically set forth in subsection (a), such as prepayment experience
  and dividend policies, will be those determined by the Director, on the
  basis of available information, to be most consistent with the stress period.
  (c) RISK-BASED CAPITAL LEVEL- For purposes of this subtitle, the risk-based
  capital level for an enterprise shall be equal to the sum of the following
  amounts:
  (1) CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK- The amount of total capital determined by
  applying the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the enterprise.
  (2) MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS RISK- To provide for management and operations
  risk, 30 percent of the amount of total capital determined by applying
  the risk-based capital test under subsection (a) to the enterprise.
  (d) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this section:
  (1) SEASONING- The term `seasoning' means the change over time in the ratio
  of the unpaid principal balance of a mortgage to the value of the property
  by which such mortgage loan is secured, determined on an annual basis by
  region, in accordance with the Constant Quality Home Price Index published
  by the Secretary of Commerce (or any index of similar quality, authority,
  and public availability that is regularly used by the Federal Government).
  (2) TYPE OF MORTGAGE PRODUCT- The term `type of mortgage product' means
  a classification of one or more mortgage products, as established by the
  Director, which have similar characteristics from each set of characteristics

  (E) The owner of the property is--
  (i) an owner-occupant; or
  (ii) an investor.
  (F) The unpaid principal balance of the mortgage--
  (i) will amortize completely over the term of the mortgage and will not
  increase significantly at any time during the term of the mortgage;
  (ii) will not amortize completely over the term of the mortgage and will
  not increase significantly at any time during the term of the mortgage; or
  (iii) may increase significantly at some time during the term of the
  mortgage.
  (G) Any other characteristics of the mortgage, as the Director may determine.
  (e) REGULATIONS-

  United States Code, and shall take effect upon issuance.
  (2) CONTENTS- The regulations under this subsection shall contain specific
  requirements, definitions, methods, variables, and parameters used under
  the risk-based capital test and in implementing the test (such as loan

  slopes, default experience, and prepayment rates). The regulations shall
  be sufficiently specific to permit an individual other than the Director
  to apply the test in the same manner as the Director.
  (3) CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION- Any person that receives any book,
  record, or information from the Director or an enterprise to enable the
  risk-based capital test to be applied shall--
