One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Acknowledging the sacrifices that military families have made on behalf of
the Nation and designating November 23, 1992, as `National Military Families
Recognition Day'.
Whereas the Congress recognizes and supports the Department of Defense
policies to recruit, train, equip, retain, and field a military force that
is capable of preserving peace and protecting the vital interests of the
United States and its allies;
Whereas military families shoulder the responsibility of providing emotional
support for their service members;
Whereas, in times of war and military action, military families have
demonstrated their patriotism through their steadfast support and commitment
to the Nation;
Whereas the emotional and mental readiness of the United States military
personnel around the world is tied to the well-being and satisfaction of
their families;
Whereas the quality of life that the Armed Forces provide to military families
is a key factor in the retention of military personnel;
Whereas the people of the United States are truly indebted to military families
for facing adversities, including extended separations from their service
members, frequent household moves due to reassignments, and restrictions on
their employment and educational opportunities;
Whereas 72 percent of officers and 54 percent of enlisted personnel in the
Armed Forces are married;
Whereas families of active duty military personnel (including individuals
other than spouses or children) account for more than 2,815,000 of the more
than 4,880,000 individuals in the active duty community, and spouses and
children of members of the Reserves in paid status account for more than
1,320,000 of the more than 2,470,000 individuals in the Reserves community;
Whereas spouses, children, and other dependents living abroad with members
of the Armed Forces total nearly 450,000 and these family members at times
face feelings of cultural isolation and financial hardship;
Whereas the significantly reduced global military tensions after the end
of the Cold war have led to a down-sizing of the national defense and a
refocusing of national priorities to strengthening the American economy and
competitiveness in the global marketplace;
Whereas the Congress is grateful for such sacrifices and is committed to
assisting the service members and their families who undergo the transition
from active duty to civilian life; and
Whereas military families are devoted to the overall mission of the Department
of Defense and have accepted the role of the United States as the military
leader and protector of the free world: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That--
  (1) the Congress acknowledges and appreciates the commitment and devotion of
  present and former military families and the sacrifices that such families
  have made on behalf of the Nation; and
  (2) November 23, 1992, is designated as `National Military Families
  Recognition Day'. The President is authorized and requested to issue a
  proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe the
  day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
