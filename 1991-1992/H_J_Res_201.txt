H.J.Res.201
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning December 1, 1991, and the week beginning
November 15, 1992, each as `Geography Awareness Week'.
Whereas geography is the study of people and their planet, offering a framework
for understanding ourselves, our interdependence with other peoples, our
relationship to the Earth, and world events;
Whereas the United States has both worldwide involvements and influence
that demand an understanding of geography, different cultures, and foreign
languages;
Whereas the credibility of our Nation's foreign policy largely depends on
the support of a geographically informed public, a public which understands
both the locations and the significance of historic changes occurring around
the globe and their impact on the United States;
Whereas an ignorance of geography, different cultures, and foreign languages
places the United States at a disadvantage with respect to other nations in
matters of business, politics, the environment, and global events;
Whereas, although geography as a distinct discipline has virtually disappeared
from the curricula of schools in the United States, it is still being taught
as a basic subject in other nations, including the United Kingdom, Canada,
Japan, and the Soviet Union;
Whereas our Nation's Governors, in their National Goals for Education,
explicitly identified geography as one of five subjects in which American
students should demonstrate competency;
Whereas a perspective in geography offers a critically needed understanding
of the relationship between human activity and the condition of our planet
in this time of increasing environmental problems;
Whereas the first federally funded National Assessment of Educational
Progress revealed a `disturbing geography knowledge gap' among 12th graders:
58 percent could locate Jerusalem on a regional map, but only 36 percent
knew that Saudi Arabia is bounded by the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf;
Whereas in a 1988 Gallup Poll, 75 percent of those surveyed could not locate
the Persian Gulf on a map, and fewer than half of those surveyed could name
Asia as the place that Christopher Columbus was hoping to reach when he
discovered the New World;
Whereas that 1988 Gallup Poll also projected that 24,000,000 Americans could
not identify the United States on a map of the world, 58,000,000 Americans
could not tell direction on a map, and 105,000,000 Americans did not know
the population of the United States;
Whereas geography is more than the study of map identification, State capitals,
and country names, but geography also gives meaning to location and establishes
a context for understanding the connections among peoples, places, and events;
Whereas the success of a democracy relies heavily upon an educated citizenry
whose members are aware of both their influence on and connection with the
rest of the world; and
Whereas national attention must be focused on the integral role that a
knowledge of world geography plays in preparing citizens of the United States
to assume a responsible role in the future of an increasingly interconnected
and interdependent world: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning December 1, 1991,
 and the week beginning November 15, 1992, are each designated as `Geography
 Awareness Week', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such
 week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
