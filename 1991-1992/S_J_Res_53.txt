S.J.Res.53
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate April 9, 1991 and April 9, 1992, as `National Former Prisoner
of War
Recognition Day'.
Whereas members of the Armed Forces of the United States have been recently
captured by the armed forces of Iraq and have been held as prisoners of war;
Whereas the prisoners of war held by Iraq have endured incredible hardships
and the events surrounding the holding of such prisoners remind us of the
thousands of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who served in
past armed conflicts and were held as prisoners of war;
Whereas many prisoners of war have been subjected to brutal and inhumane
treatment by their captors in violation of international codes and customs
for the treatment of prisoners of war;
Whereas many former prisoners of war died, or were disabled, as a result of
such treatment;
Whereas, in 1985, the United States Congress directed the Department of Defense
to issue a medal to former prisoners of war recognizing and commemorating
their great sacrifices in service to our Nation; and
Whereas the great sacrifices of prisoners of war and their families deserve
national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That April 9, 1991 and April 9, 1992, are
 designated as `National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day' in honor
 of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who have been held
 as prisoners of war, and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to commemorate
 such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
