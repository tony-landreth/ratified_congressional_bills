Joint Resolution
Entitled `National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving'.
Whereas the United States responded decisively to the crisis in the Middle
East created by the invasion of Iraqi troops into Kuwait and the unlawful
annexation of that sovereign state by Iraq;
Whereas a worldwide coalition was forged to preserve international order
and stop Iraqi aggression;
Whereas President Bush pursued his strategy against Iraq with foresight and
purpose from the moment Kuwait was invaded;
Whereas our military leaders planned their campaign on air, land and sea,
with innovation and precision;
Whereas American troops have served bravely in the Middle East at great
personal risk in the defense of freedom;
Whereas we have seen a stunning triumph of American leadership, military
strength and technology;
Whereas the families of American military personnel stationed in the Middle
East or held captive by the Iraqi government have faced great anxiety;
Whereas the families and friends of those who have fallen bear the greatest,
most tragic loss of all;
Whereas Americans have traditionally recognized the importance and strength
derived from prayer at such a difficult time;
 Whereas our Nation has always trusted in a Providence which vindicates the
 oppressed and defends the right: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States
 declare a national day of prayer and thanksgiving to express our gratitude
 for the heroic efforts of our troops and to offer our thanks to God, the
 ruler of men and nations, the source of justice, and the author of true peace.
