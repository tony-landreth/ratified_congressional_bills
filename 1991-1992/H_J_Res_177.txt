AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate November 16, 1991, as `Dutch-American Heritage Day'.
Whereas, on November 16, 1776, the batteries at the Dutch port of St. Eustatius
fired the 1st salute to the flag of the newly independent United States;
Whereas the firing by the Dutch of the 1st salute to the flag of the United
States uplifted the morale and determination of the individuals who were
fighting for American independence;
Whereas commemoration of Dutch-American Heritage Day provides an opportunity
for approximately 8,000,000 Dutch Americans to celebrate their Dutch roots
and the extraordinary contributions their ancestors made to the political,
economic, and cultural development of the United States; and
Whereas commemoration of Dutch-American Heritage Day promotes awareness by
the people of the United States of the essential role performed by the Dutch
people in securing American independence and in aiding the development of
the United States for the past 215 years: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 16, 1991, is designated as
 `Dutch-American Heritage Day', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to
 observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
