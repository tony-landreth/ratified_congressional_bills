S.J.Res. 174
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating the month of May 1992, as `National Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis Awareness Month'.
Whereas over 300,000 people alive today will eventually die from Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (`ALS'), commonly known as `Lou Gehrig's Disease', which
afflicts the motor-neuron system of the human body;
Whereas at least 5,000 people will be diagnosed this year as having ALS,
or an average of 13 cases per day;
Whereas there is still no known cause or cure for ALS despite the fact that
the disease was discovered in 1869;
Whereas victims of this disease may lose total movement of their arms, legs,
fingers, and toes, as well as the ability to speak, swallow, or breathe;
Whereas ALS patients have an average life expectancy of between 2 and 5
years after being diagnosed as having the disease;
Whereas wheelchairs, respirators, and feeding tubes are often necessary to
assist those who outlive the average life expectancy;
Whereas the National Institutes of Health have found that victims of ALS
are increasingly younger, with many in their 20's and 30's, and some mere
teenagers;
Whereas ALS strikes people regardless of race, sex, age, or ethnicity;
Whereas the number of male victims of ALS under the age of 50 equals the
number of female victims, but over the age of 50, male victims outnumber
female victims by a ratio of 3 to 1;
Whereas finding the causes of, and the cure for, ALS will prevent the disease
from robbing hundreds of thousands of Americans of their dignity and lives;
Whereas 1992 marks the 51st anniversary of the death of one of America's
greatest baseball players, Lou Gehrig, for whom the disease was named; and
Whereas raising public awareness of this disease will facilitate the discovery
of a cure: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of May 1992, is designated as
 `National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs and
 activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
