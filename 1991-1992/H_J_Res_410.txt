One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating April 14, 1992, as `Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.'.
Whereas Congress recognizes the historical tradition of ethical values and
principles which are the basis of civilized society and upon which our great
Nation, the United States of America, was founded;
Whereas President George W. Bush, distinguished leader of our great Nation,
stated `Ethical values are the foundation for civilized society. A society
that fails to recognize or adhere to them cannot endure.';
Whereas these ethical values and principles have been the cornerstone of
society since the dawn of civilization when they were known as the Seven
Noahide Laws;
Whereas the Government of the United States and its citizens are committed to
the ideals of social equality and the right of each and every person to share
in the bounty the world has to offer--ideals deeply rooted in our Nation's
history and boldly affirmed by the miraculous changes of the past year;
Whereas our Nation has recently witnessed the beginning triumph of these
values through wonders around the world of biblical proportions;
Whereas the end of the Cold War heralds the beginning of an era where
individual rights and human dignity become paramount and where the dream
of a world in which material and spiritual deprivation is replaced by human
kindness and compassion becomes a reality;
Whereas the absolute necessity of mutual responsibility and concern for
the needy has been of particular concern to `the Rebbe', Rabbi Menachem
M. Schneerson, leader of the Lubavitch movement;
Whereas the Lubavitch movement, through the establishment of over 1,000
social welfare and educational institutions throughout the world under the
leadership of `the Rebbe', has long supported and promoted dedication to
education and selfless concern for others;
Whereas Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson has recently issued a worldwide call
for a revitalized dedication to loving kindness, charity, and sharing between
man and his fellow man;
Whereas Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson is universally revered by all faiths,
respected as spiritual leader of world Jewry, and his 90th birthday falls
on April 14, 1992;
Whereas in tribute to this great spiritual leader, `the Rebbe', his birthday
will be designated as `Education and Sharing Day U.S.A.' and this year,
his 91st, will mark a new beginning in an age-old commitment to education,
accompanied by an increase in general acts of sharing with another, in order
to return the world to the moral and ethical values contained in the Seven
Noahide Laws; and
Whereas this will be reflected in an international scroll of honor signed by
the President of the United States and other heads of state: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That April 14, 1992, the birthday and the
 start of the 91st year of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the
 worldwide Lubavitch movement, is designated as `Education and Sharing Day,
 U.S.A.'. The President is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the
 people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
