S.J.Res.156
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of October 6, 1991, through October 12, 1991, as `Mental
Illness Awareness Week'.
Whereas mental illness is a problem of grave concern and consequence in the
United States, widely but unnecessarily feared and misunderstood;
Whereas 31,000,000 to 41,000,000 United States citizens annually suffer from
clearly diagnosable mental disorders involving significant disability with
respect to employment, school attendance, and independent living;
Whereas more than 10,000,000 United States citizens are disabled for long
periods of time by schizophrenia, manic depressive disorder, and major
depression;
Whereas 33 percent of the homeless suffer serious, chronic forms of mental
illness;
Whereas alcohol, drug, and mental disorders affect almost 19 percent of
adults in this country in any 6-month period;
Whereas mental illness in at least 12,000,000 of our children interferes
with vital developmental and maturational processes;
Whereas mental disorder related deaths are estimated to be, at the very least,
33,000 annually, with suicide accounting for at least 29,000 of such deaths;
Whereas our growing population of the elderly is particularly vulnerable to
mental illness;
Whereas estimates indicate that 10 percent of AIDS patients will develop
dementia or other psychiatric problems as the first sign of such disease,
and that as many as two-thirds of AIDS patients will show neuropsychiatric
symptoms before they die;
Whereas mental disorders result in staggering costs to society, estimated
to be in excess of 249,000,000,000 dollars in direct treatment and support
and indirect costs to society, including lost productivity;
Whereas the Federal research budget committed to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration represents only about 1 percent of the direct
clinical costs of caring for persons with alcohol, drug, and mental disorders;
Whereas mental illness is increasingly a treatable disability with excellent
prospects for amelioration and recovery when properly recognized;
Whereas families of mentally ill persons and those persons themselves have
begun to join selfhelp groups seeking to combat the unfair stigma of the
diseases, to support greater national investment in research, and to advocate
an adequate continuum of care from hospital to community;
Whereas in recent years there have been unprecedented major research
developments bringing new methods and technology to the sophisticated and
objective study of the functioning of the brain and its linkages to both
normal and abnormal behavior;
Whereas research in recent decades has led to a wide array of new and more
effective modalities of treatment (both somatic and psychosocial) for some
of the most incapacitating forms of mental illness, including schizophrenia,
major affective disorders, phobias, and phobic disorders;
Whereas appropriate treatment of mental illness has been demonstrated to
be cost effective in terms of restored productivity, reduced use of other
health services, and lessened social dependence; and
Whereas recent and unparalleled growth in scientific knowledge about mental
illness has generated the current emergence of a new threshold of opportunity
for future research advances and fruitful application to specific clinical
problems: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the period of October 6, 1991, through
 October 12, 1991, is designated as `Mental Illness Awareness Week' and
 the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
 programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
