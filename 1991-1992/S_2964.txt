  any amendment thereof, and no project shall be authorized if not included in
  the master plan or amendment thereof. Any project which has been commenced
  and approved by the commission prior to the adoption of the master plan
  shall be included, for informational purposes only, in the master plan. The
  commission shall provide notice of such on-going projects to those States,
  county and municipal governments, as well as entities in the private sector
