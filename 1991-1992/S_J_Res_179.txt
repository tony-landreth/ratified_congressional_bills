S.J.Res.179
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning August 25, 1991, as `National Parks Week'.
Whereas on August 25, 1916, the Congress established the National Park Service
charged with the conservation of `the scenery and the natural and historic
objects and the wildlife' of the National Park System and `to provide for
the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave
them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations';
Whereas the National Park Service, now celebrating its seventy-fifth
anniversary, has shown leadership in the protection of our Nation's natural,
cultural, and recreational resources internationally, nationally, and locally;
Whereas today the three hundred and fifty-seven units of the National Park
System preserve and interpret unique resources that shape our Nation's sense
of its identity, from the scenic beauty of the great natural parks to the
rich diversity of the historical and archeological areas and the varied
activities of the recreational areas;
Whereas millions of Americans as well as people from foreign nations visit
the national parks each year, deriving pleasure and inspiration from them;
Whereas we who have inherited this legacy and who are enriched by it,
believe that the parks deserve to be kept unimpaired to ensure that future
generations will continue to appreciate and enjoy them;
Whereas the National Park Service has long cooperated with the States,
counties, localities, and other entities to assist in the preservation of
historic resources, the management of diverse natural resources, and the
increase of public recreational opportunities;
Whereas the men and women of the National Park Service charged with the
protection of our parks and their visitors have steadfastly served the
purposes for which the national park system was created; and
Whereas, during the year beginning August 25, 1991, the National Park Service
will celebrate its diamond anniversary with programs focusing the Nation's
attention on the riches of these parks and the need for their preservation:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning August 25, 1991,
 is hereby designated as `National Park Week' and the President of the United
 States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation inviting the people
 of the United States and the world to participate in the events commemorating
 the seventy-fifth anniversary of the creation of the National Park Service.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
