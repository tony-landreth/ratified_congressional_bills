S.J.Res.36
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the months of November 1991, and November 1992, as `National
Alzheimer's Disease Month'.
Whereas over 4 million United States citizens are affected by Alzheimer's
disease, a surprisingly common degenerative disease which attacks the brain,
impairs memory and thinking, alters behavior, and renders its victims
incapable of self care;
Whereas it is estimated that by the middle of the 21st century, Alzheimer's
disease will strike 14 million United States citizens, affecting one in
every three families;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is not a normal consequence of aging, but a
disorder of the brain for which no cause has been determined and no treatment
or cure has been found;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the quintessential long-term care problem,
requiring constant full-time care for its victims, who can suffer from the
disease for 3 to 20 years, at a total annual cost to the Nation of at least
$90 billion;
Whereas families of Alzheimer's patients bear the overwhelming physical,
emotional, and financial burden of care, and neither public programs, including
medicare, nor private insurance provide protection for most of these families;
Whereas 80 percent of all Alzheimer's patients receive care in their own homes;
Whereas nearly half of all residents of nursing homes suffer from Alzheimer's
disease or some other form of dementia; and
Whereas increased national awareness of Alzheimer's disease and recognition
of national organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association may stimulate
increased commitment to long-term care services to support Alzheimer's patients
and their families and a greater investment in research to discover methods
to prevent the disease, delay its onset, and eventually to find a cure for
the disease: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the months of November 1991, and
 November 1992, are designated as `National Alzheimer's Disease Month',
 and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe such months with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
