H.J.Res.255
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning July 21, 1991, as the `Korean War Veterans
Remembrance Week'.
Whereas July 27, 1991, is the 38th anniversary of the cease-fire agreement
which ended the active combat of the Korean War;
Whereas in June 1950, prompt action by the United States to add its armed
forces to those of the Republic of Korea helped to counter an invasion by
North Korea of the Republic of Korea;
Whereas in addition to the United States and the Republic of Korea, 20 other
nations provided military contingents to serve under the United Nations banner,
marking the first time in history that countries under United Nations command
repelled a flagrant attack in order to preserve the liberty of another country;
Whereas after 3 years of active hostilities, the territorial integrity of
the Republic of Korea was restored and the freedom and independence of its
people assured;
Whereas over 5,700,000 American servicemen and servicewomen were directly
or indirectly involved in the Korean War;
Whereas American casualties during the Korean War were 54,246 dead (of which
33,629 were battle deaths), 103,284 wounded, 8,177 listed as missing in action
or prisoners of war (of which 329 prisoners of war are still unaccounted for);
Whereas although the Korean War has become known as `The Forgotten War',
the United States should never forget the ultimate sacrifice made by those
who fought and died in Korea for the noble and just cause of freedom;
Whereas the establishment of a Korean War Veterans Memorial in the Nation's
Capital has been authorized to recognize and honor the service and the
sacrifice of those who participated in the Korean War (Public Law 99-572);
Whereas the Secretary of the Treasury is required to mint a silver dollar coin
in commemoration of the 38th anniversary of the end of the Korean War and in
honor of those who served (section 5112 note of title 31, United States Code);
Whereas increasing numbers of veterans of the Korean War are setting aside
July 27, the anniversary date of the cease-fire which ended the active combat
of that war, as a special day to remember those with whom they served and to
honor those who made the supreme sacrifice in a war to preserve the ideals
of freedom and independence for a people they had never known; and
Whereas on this significant anniversary of the cease-fire which began the
longest military armistice in modern history, it is right and appropriate
to recognize, honor, and remember the service and sacrifice of those who
endured the rigors of combat and the extremes of a hostile climate under the
most trying conditions and still prevailed to preserve the independence of
a free nation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning July 21, 1991, is
 designated as the `Korean War Veterans Remembrance Week', and the President
 is authorized and requested--
 (1) to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and
 (2) to urge the Executive departments and agencies, interested organizations,
 groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff
 on July 27, 1991, in honor of those Americans who died as a result of their
 service in Korea.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
