 overall goal of protecting the United States against the threat posed by
 ballistic missiles, Congress endorses such additional measures as--
 (1) joint discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union on
 strengthening nuclear command and control, to include discussions concerning
 the use of permissive action links and post-launch destruct mechanisms on
 all intercontinental-range ballistic missiles of the two nations;
 (2) reductions that enhance stability in strategic weapons of the United
 States and Soviet Union to levels below the limitations of the Strategic
 Arms Reduction Talks (START) Treaty, to include the down-loading of multiple
 warhead ballistic missiles; and
 (3) reinvigorated efforts to halt the proliferation of ballistic missiles
 and weapons of mass destruction.

SEC. 732. DEPENDENCY STATUS OF A MINOR IN THE CUSTODY OF A NON-PARENT MEMBER
OR FORMER MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds the following:
 (1) Members and former members of the Armed Forces, for good and humanitarian
 reasons or because of a deep sense of familial responsibility, are taking
 legal custody of minors (including minors related to a member or former
 member by blood or adoption) who are neglected, abandoned, abused, or
 orphaned children.
 (2) Under current law, unless a minor referred to in paragraph (1) is
 also adopted by a member or former member of the Armed Forces, the minor
 is not considered a dependent of the member or former member for purposes
 of eligibility for care in the military medical health care system under
 chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, or allowances under chapter 7
 of title 37, United States Code. A compelling reason for the reluctance of
 many members and  former members to adopt minors referred to in paragraph
 (1) is the fact that they are already related by blood or adoption.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) creative solutions should be found to enable a member or former member
 of the Armed Forces who is eligible for military health care to obtain
 care in the military medical health care system for a minor who is in the
 legal custody of the member or former member, especially when the minor is
 related by blood or adoption to the member or former member; and
 (2) the Secretaries of the military departments, in exercising their authority
 to grant designee status to a minor to receive health care at military
 treatment facilities, should give special attention and consideration to
 those cases involving a minor who is related by blood or adoption to a
 member or former member of the Armed Forces and is in the legal custody of
 the member or former member.
 (c) REPORT- (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment
 of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to Congress
 analyzing the desirability, feasibility, and cost implications of implementing
 a permanent change to the definition of dependent for purposes of eligibility
 for care in the military medical health care system under chapter 55 of
 title 10, United States Code, and allowances under chapter 7 of title 37,
 United States Code, to include minors who are in the legal custody of,
 and related by blood or adoption to, a member or former member of the Armed
 Forces and are not currently included in such definition.
 (2) The report required by this section shall also include data covering the
 preceding five-year period to indicate the manner in which the Secretaries
 of the military departments have handled requests for designee status for
 minors who are in the legal custody of a member or former member of the
 Armed Forces, including minors related by blood or adoption to a member or
 former member,  and are otherwise ineligible for health care in the military
 medical health care system. Such data shall include--
 (A) the total number of requests for designee status involving these minors
 during that period;
 (B) the total number of these minors given designee status during that
 period; and
 (C) the average distance and range of distances that the minors given
 designee status must travel for medical and dental care in the military
 medical health care system.
 (3) The report required by this section shall also include an assessment
 by the Secretary of Defense of the necessity, desirability, and cost
 implications of designating as dependents for purposes of eligibility for
 care in the military medical health care system under chapter 55 of title
 10, United States Code, and allowances under chapter 7 of title 37, United
 States Code, unmarried persons who--
 (A) are in the legal custody of members or former members of the Armed Forces;
 (B) are not considered the dependents of a member or former member for
 purposes of eligibility to obtain care in the military medical health care
 system or allowances under chapter 7 of title 37, United States Code;
 (C) are dependent on the member for half of their support; and
 (D) are under 21 years of age, incapable of self support because of
 disability, or under 23 years of age and enrolled in a full-time course of
 study in an institution of higher education.
 (4) The assessment required by paragraph (3) shall include an estimate of
 the number of persons referred to in that paragraph who potentially could
 be granted dependent status as a result of the change considered in that
 assessment and the costs of making that change.

 (A) Timely payment of progress or other periodic payments to subcontractors
 and suppliers by prime contractors on Federal contracts by--
 (i) identifying all existing statutory and regulatory provisions, categorized
 by types of contracts covered by such provisions;
 (ii) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring that a prime
 contractor (other than a construction prime contractor subject to the
 provisions of sections 3903(b) and 3905 of title 31, United States Code)
 be required to--
 (I) include in its subcontracts a payment term requiring payment within 7 days
 (or some other fixed term) after receiving payment from the Government; and

 it has timely paid its subcontractors in accordance with their subcontracts
 from funds previously received as progress payments and will timely make
 required payments to such subcontractors from the proceeds of the progress
 payment covered by the certification;
 (iii) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring that all
 prime contractors (other than a construction prime contractor subject to
 the provisions of sections 3903(b) and 3905 of title 31, United States Code)
 furnish with its payment request to the Government proof of payment of the
 amounts included in such payment request for payments made to subcontractors
 and suppliers;
 (iv) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring a prime
 contractor to establish an escrow account at a federally insured financial
 institution and requiring direct disbursements to subcontractors and suppliers
 of amounts certified by the prime contractor in its payment request to
 the Government as being payable to such subcontractors and suppliers in
 accordance with their subcontracts; and
 (v) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring direct
 disbursement of amounts certified by a prime contractor as being payable
 to its subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with their subcontracts
 (using techniques such as joint payee checks, escrow accounts, or direct
 payment by the Government), if the contracting officer has determined that
 the prime contractor is failing to make timely payments to its subcontractors
 and suppliers.
 (B) Payment protection of subcontractors and suppliers through the use of
 payment bonds or alternatives methods by--
 (i) evaluating the effectiveness of the modifications to part 28.2 of the

 the use of individual sureties, which became effective February 26, 1990;
 (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of requiring payment bonds pursuant to the
 Miller Act as a means of affording protection to construction subcontractors
 and suppliers relating to receiving--
 (I) timely payment of progress payments due in accordance with their
 subcontracts; and
 (II) ultimate payment of such amounts due;
 (iii) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of increasing the payment
 bond amounts required under the Miller Act from the current maximum amounts
 to an amount equal to 100 percent of the amount of the contract;
 (iv) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of requiring payment
 bonds for supply and services contracts (other than construction), and,
 if feasible and desirable, the amounts of such bonds; and
 (v) evaluating the feasibility and desirability of using letters of credit
 issued by federally insured financial institutions (or other alternatives)
 as substitutes for payment bonds in providing payment protection to
 subcontractors and suppliers on construction contracts (and other contracts).
 (C) Any evaluation of feasibility and desirability carried out pursuant to
 subparagraph (A) or (B) shall include the appropriateness of--
 (i) any differential treatment of, or impact on, small business concerns
 as opposed to concerns other than small business concerns;
 (ii) any differential treatment of subcontracts relating to commercial
 products entered into by the contractor in furtherance of its non-Government
 business, especially those subcontracts entered into prior to the award of
 a contract by the Government; and
 (iii) extending the protections regarding payment to all tiers of
 subcontractors or restricting them to first-tier subcontractors and direct
 suppliers.

 protections for subcontractors and suppliers under contracts entered into

 by officials of the Department to deter false statements relating to (A)
 payment bonds provided by individuals pursuant to the Miller Act, and (B)
 certifications pertaining to payment requests by construction contractors
 pursuant to section 3903(b) of title 31, United States Code. The assessment

SEC. 1044. UNITED STATES TROOPS IN KOREA.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States plans to reduce its troop presence in the Republic
 of Korea to 36,500 personnel by the end of 1992.
 (2) The Department of Defense has not announced specific plans for further
 personnel reductions below that level.
 (3) The National Unification Board of South Korea estimates the gross
 national product (GNP) of North Korea to have been $21,000,000,000 in 1989,
 while the Bank of Korea estimates that the size of the Republic of Korea's
 economy in that year was $210,000,000,000, a factor of 10 larger. At its
 current growth rate, as estimated by the Economic Planning Board of the
 Republic of Korea, the annual expansion of the economy of the Republic of
 Korea is nearly equivalent in size to the entire North Korean economy.
 (4) The Republic of Korea continues to face a substantial military threat
 from North Korea that requires a vigorous response on both military and
 diplomatic levels.
 (5) The Republic of Korea has decided to increase its level of host nation
 support, although such support still falls short of the actual cost involved
 and short of the relative level provided by the Government of Japan.
 (6) While recognizing that the Republic of Korea has consistently increased
 its defense budget in real terms by an average of about 6 percent annually
 for the past five years, to a current level of 4.2 percent of gross national
 product, the Republic of Korea devotes a smaller share of its economy to
 defense than does the United States, at 4.9 percent of gross national product.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that--
 (1) the Republic of Korea remains an important ally of the United States,
 with the two countries sharing important political, economic, and security
 interests;
 (2) commensurate with the security situation on the Korean peninsula and
 the size and vitality of the economy of the Republic of Korea--
 (A) the Department of Defense should consider whether future reductions of
 United States military forces from the Republic of Korea beyond those now
 planned to be completed by the end of 1992 can be made in a way that does
 not undermine the credibility or effectiveness of those forces against an
 attack by North Korea; and
 (B) the Republic of Korea should undertake greater efforts to meet its
 security requirements, particularly in the area of force modernization; and
 (3) the Government of the Republic of Korea should increase the level of
 host nation support it provides to United States forces in the area so that
 its relative level more closely approximates that of Japan.
 (c) PRESIDENTIAL REPORT- (1) The President shall transmit to Congress,
 either separately or as part of another relevant report, a report on the
 overall security situation on the Korean peninsula, the implications of
 relevant political and economic developments in the area for the security
 situation there, and United States policy for the area.
 (2) Issues covered in the report shall include--
 (A) a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the military balance on
 the Korean peninsula;
 (B) a description of the material requirements of the armed forces of the
 Republic of Korea;
 (C) a description of United States military personnel requirements;
 (D) a description of the state of United States-Republic of Korea
 relations, the state of China-Republic of Korea relations, and the state
 of Soviet-Republic of Korea relations; and
 (E) a description of prospects for change in North Korea.
 (3) The report shall be transmitted not later than June 30, 1992, and shall
 be transmitted in both classified and unclassified form.

Part F--Congressional Findings, Policies, and Commendations
SEC. 1071. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OPERATION
DESERT STORM MADE BY THE DEFENSE- RELATED INDUSTRIES OF THE UNITED STATES.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States and its coalition allies achieved a great victory
 in Operation Desert Storm, carried out in the Persian Gulf region in the
 winter of 1991.
 (2) The outstanding success of Operation Desert Storm was due in great
 measure to the ready availability of weapons and weapon systems exhibiting
 remarkable accuracy through advanced technological design.
 (3) These weapons and weapon systems were designed and produced by the
 defense-related industries of the United States.
 (4) The battle plan for Operation Desert Storm formulated by the commander of
 the United States Central Command relied on the availability and performance
 of these weapons and weapon systems.
 (5) The successful use of these weapons and weapon systems in accordance
 with that plan resulted in astonishingly small numbers of killed and wounded
 among the Armed Forces of the United States and of allied coalition forces
 in general.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress--
 (1) that the defense-related industries of the United States, and the men and
 women who work in those industries, deserve the gratitude and appreciation of
 the Congress and of the United States for the design and production of the
 technologically-advanced weapons and weapon systems that helped to ensure
 victory in Operation Desert Storm;
 (2) that future decisions relating to the national security of the United
 States must take into account the need to maintain strong defense-related
 industries in the United States; and
 (3) that it is vitally important to the United States that the defense-related
 industries of the United States be capable of responding to the national
 security requirements of the United States.
SEC. 1072. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO COOPERATION BETWEEN THE MILITARY
DEPARTMENTS AND BIG BROTHERS AND BIG SISTERS ORGANIZATIONS.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The Big Brothers of America and the Big Sisters of America, consisting
 of 499 independent organizations located across the United States, assist
 at-risk children and the families of such children by establishing mentor
 programs that foster one-to-one relationships between such children and
 concerned adult mentors.
 (2) The Big Brothers and Big Sisters organizations annually assist
 approximately 110,000 such children.
 (3) As a result of cooperation between the Department of Defense and Big
 Brothers and Big Sisters organizations, successful mentor programs have
 been established at several military installations located in the United
 States and overseas.
 (4) There are an estimated 80,000 single-parent families, and at least
 80,000 at-risk youth in those families, that are headed by members of the
 Armed Forces.
 (5) Appropriately trained members of the Armed Forces are exceptionally
 qualified to serve as concerned adult mentors of at-risk youths in Big
 Brothers and Big Sisters mentor programs.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) additional cooperation between the Department of Defense and the Big
 Brothers and Big Sisters organizations located in communities near military
 installations will assist members of the Armed Forces serving at those
 installations and those communities in responding to the family support
 needs of those members and communities; and
 (2) the Secretary of Defense should take all practicable steps necessary to
 encourage such cooperation at military installations located in the United
 States and to promote the establishment of additional Big Brothers and Big
 Sisters organizations at such installations located overseas.
SEC. 1073. COMMENDATION OF THE MILITARY COLLEGES FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO
TRAINING CITIZEN-SOLDIERS.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The number of essential military colleges (institutions that the
 Department of Defense has recognized as constituting a special aspect of
 American higher education) has decreased from 11 institutions in 1914 to only
 4 today: Norwich University, founded in 1819; Virginia Military Institute,
 established in 1839; The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina,
 chartered in 1842; and North Georgia College, which opened in 1873.
 (2) The hallmark of these institutions has been their dedication to the
 principle of the citizen-soldier, and in this regard they are joined in
 spirit and devotion by the Cadet Corps at Texas A & M University and at
 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
 (3) Citizen-soldiers are educated, trained, and inspired to become productive
 members of society in any calling, but are also prepared to serve their
 country in a military role during times of war or national peril.
 (4) These citizen-soldiers have accepted as their duty an obligation to
 serve their country in every instance of war since the Mexican War, and
 have without fail or hesitation answered the call to arms--most recently
 with service in Southwest Asia as part of Operation Desert Storm.
 (b) RECOGNITION AND COMMENDATION- In light of the findings in subsection
 (a), the Congress--
 (1) recognizes and commends military colleges for the unique contributions
 they have made and continue to make; and
 (2) urges citizens of the United States to support the concept of the
 citizen-soldier to which these colleges are dedicated.
SEC. 1074. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE CHEMICAL DECONTAMINATION TRAINING
FACILITY, FORT MCCLELLAN, ALABAMA.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The possibility of use of chemical weapons by Iraqi forces was the most
 significant military threat confronted by members of the Armed Forces of
 the United States who served in the Persian Gulf region in connection with
 Operation Desert Storm.
 (2) There continues to be extreme concern with respect to the ever more rapid
 proliferation of chemical weapons and agents, especially among nations in
 the Middle East.
 (3) This proliferation makes it increasingly necessary that members of the
 Armed Forces have the capability of self-defense against chemical weapons
 and agents.
 (4) Combat training with live chemical agents directly promotes this
 capability by reducing the life-threatening fear and self doubt that some
 soldiers experience on a battlefield contaminated by chemical weapons
 or agents.
 (5) Such training further promotes this capability by enhancing the
 professional credibility of the members of the Armed Forces who train others
 with respect to chemical weapons and agents.
 (6) The Chemical Decontamination Training Facility (CDTF) located at Fort
 McClellan, Alabama, is the only facility for conducting combat training
 with live chemical agents in the Western Hemisphere.
 (7) The operations of the Chemical Decontamination Training Facility
 depend upon the support activities of the Army Chemical School which is
 also located at Fort McClellan, Alabama.
 (8) The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission has reported that
 the closure or diminished operation of the Chemical Decontamination Training
 Facility could have an adverse impact on the capability of the Armed Forces
 to defend against the use of chemical weapons and agents and, thus, on the
 national security of the United States.
 (9) The capability of members of the Armed Forces to defend against chemical
 weapons and agents depends upon maintaining a fully operating facility for
 conducting combat training with live chemical agents located in the Western
 Hemisphere including maintaining associated support activities.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that the necessity for
 the Armed Forces to have an effective live chemical agent training facility
 requires that the Chemical Decontamination Training Facility and the Army
 Chemical School be continued in operation at Fort McClellan, Alabama,
 unless a new facility for conducting combat training with live chemical
 agents is constructed.
SEC. 1075. POLICY REGARDING CONTRACTING WITH FOREIGN FIRMS THAT PARTICIPATE
IN THE SECONDARY ARAB BOYCOTT.
 (a) RESTATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING TRADE BOYCOTTS- As stated in section
 3(5)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2402(5)(A)),
 it is the policy of the United States to oppose restrictive trade practices
 or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries
 friendly to the United States or against any other United States person.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- Consistent with the policy referred to in subsection
 (a), it is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) no Department of Defense prime contract should be awarded to a foreign
 person unless that person certifies to the Secretary of Defense that it
 does not comply with the secondary Arab boycott of Israel; and
 (2) the Secretary of Defense should consider developing a procurement policy
 to implement the policy expressed in paragraph (1).
SEC. 1076. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ISSUANCE OF COMMEMORATIVE CARD FOR
OPERATION DESERT STORM SERVICEMEMBERS.
 (a) ISSUANCE OF CARD- It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of
 Defense may issue a special commemorative card to each member of the Armed
 Forces who--
 (1) served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations in connection with
 the Persian Gulf conflict (including service as a member of an air crew
 over that theater); or
 (2) as a member of a reserve component or a retired member, was ordered to
 active duty in connection with the Persian Gulf conflict.
 (b) CONTENT- Any such commemorative card shall indicate that the servicemember
 was a participant in the Persian Gulf conflict.
Part G--Miscellaneous Matters
SEC. 1081. SURVIVOR NOTIFICATION AND ASSISTANCE; ACCESS TO MILITARY RECORDS
OF SERVICE MEMBERS WHO DIE ON ACTIVE DUTY.
 (a) POLICY RE-EXAMINATION- The Secretary of Defense shall reexamine policies
 of the Department of Defense relating to casualty notification and assistance,
 including policies relating to the access of parents, spouses, and adult
 children to the records of deceased members of the Armed Forces. The review
 (1) should determine if existing regulations adequately respect a service
 member's wishes in the event of death on active duty, and (2) should consider
 new needs or problems resulting from complex family situations. The review
 should take into account experiences resulting from the Persian Gulf conflict
 and should seek to determine if changes in policy or procedures would be
 in the best interests of both service members and their families.
 (b) MATTERS TO BE EXAMINED- The study should examine the advantages and
 disadvantages of each of the following:
 (1) Making the personnel records of a service member who dies on active
 duty available, in whole or in part, to any adult family member who requests
 those records.
 (2) Excluding from disclosure to family members certain types or categories
 of information in a deceased service member's personnel records and,
 if any should ever be excluded, identifying what contents and under what
 circumstances.
 (3) Releasing to family members of a deceased service member relevant records
 not in the member's personnel records, such as any record of investigation
 into the circumstances of the member's death.
 (4) Making autopsy reports automatically available to family members upon
 request.
 (5) Requiring that more than one family member make a request before
 activating the release of any information from the member's personnel records.
 (6) Revising the `Emergency Data' form prepared by service members (A) to
 allow specific provision for notification of additional family members in
 cases such as the case of a divorced service member who leaves children with
 both a current and a former spouse, or (B) to establish which family member
 should be entitled to have access to the service member's military records.
 (7) Such other matters as the Secretary determines to be appropriate or
 relevant to the purposes of the study.
 (c) REPORT- The Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services
 of the Senate and House of Representatives a report containing the results
 of the study not later than February 1, 1992.

 to the board for further proceedings. Upon receipt of a report returned
 by the Secretary concerned under this paragraph, the selection board (or

SEC. 3505. POLICY ON MILITARY BASE RIGHTS IN PANAMA.
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) the Panama Canal is a vital strategic asset to the United States and
 its allies;
 (2) the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the
 Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Treaty, both signed on September 7, 1977,
 mandate that (A) no United States troops are to remain in Panama after
 December 31, 1999; (B) the Canal Zone is to be incorporated into Panama; (C)
 United States Panama-based communications facilities are to be phased out;
 (D) all United States training in Panama of Latin American soldiers is to
 be halted; and (E) management and operational control of the Canal is to
 be turned over to Panamanian authorities;
 (3) the government of President Guillermo Endara has demonstrated its
 determination to restore democracy to Panama by quickly moving to implement
 changes in the nation's political, economic, and judicial systems;
 (4) friendly cooperative relations currently exist between the United States
 and the Republic of Panama;
 (5) the region has a history of unstable governments which pose a threat to
 the future operation of the Panama Canal, and the United States must have
 the discretion and the means to defend the Canal and ensure its continuous
 operation and availability to the military and commercial shipping of the
 United States and its allies in times of crisis;
 (6) the Panama Canal is vulnerable to disruption and closure by unforeseen
 events in Panama, by terrorist attack, and by air strikes or other attack
 by foreign powers;
 (7) the United States fleet depends upon the Panama Canal for rapid transit
 ocean to ocean in times of emergency, as demonstrated during World War
 II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Conflict, the Cuban Missile Crisis,
 and the Persian Gulf Conflict, thereby saving 13,000 miles and three weeks
 steaming effort around Cape Horn;
 (8) the presence of the United States Armed Forces offers a viable defense
 against sabotage or other threat to the Panama Canal; and
 (9) the 10,000 United States military personnel now based in Panama,
 including the headquarters of the United States Southern Command, cannot
 remain there beyond December 31, 1999, without a new agreement with Panama.
 (b) POLICY- It is the sense of the Congress that the President--
 (1) should begin negotiations with the Government of Panama, at a mutually
 acceptable time, to consider whether the two Governments should allow the
 permanent stationing of United States military forces in Panama beyond
 December 31, 1999; and
 (2) should consult with the Congress throughout those negotiations.
