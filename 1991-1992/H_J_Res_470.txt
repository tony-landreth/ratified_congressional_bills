H.J.Res.470
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of September 1992 as `National Spina Bifida Awareness
Month'.
Whereas spina bifida is the most frequently occurring and permanently disabling
birth defect of newborns, occurring in one of every one thousand live births
in the United States;
Whereas between 1980 and 1989, 18,000 children were born with spina bifida
in the United States and of that number 13,500 have survived;
Whereas spina bifida occurs more often than Cystic Fibrosis, Multiple
Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, and polio combined;
Whereas spina bifida is a birth defect in the spinal column resulting when
the spinal cord fails to close completely during prenatal development;
Whereas spina bifida may result in varying degrees of paralysis, loss of
sensation in the lower limbs, and bladder and bowel complications, and often
is accompanied by hydrocephalus;
Whereas the cause of spina bifida is not known but the cause appears to be
the result of multiple environmental and genetic factors;
Whereas although most of the March of Dimes and Easter Seal poster children
have spina bifida, many people across this Nation have not heard of the
defect and its debilitating consequences for children;
Whereas only a few cities in the United States have proper care centers and
specialized professionals that can provide the most effective, aggressive
treatment for children and adults with spina bifida; and
Whereas an increase in the national awareness of the problem of spina bifida
may stimulate the interest and concern of the American people, which may
lead, in turn, to increased research into the needs of individuals with
spina bifida and the prevention of spina bifida: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of September 1992 is designated
 `National Spina Bifida Awareness Month', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe that month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
