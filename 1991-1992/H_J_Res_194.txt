H.J.Res.194
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating May 12, 1991, as `Infant Mortality Awareness Day'.
Whereas in 1988 the infant mortality rate in the United States decreased
from 10.1 to 10 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, while the United States
international ranking in infant mortality improved from 22nd to 21st;
Whereas, although our Nation has made progress against infant mortality,
more than 38,000 babies will die in 1991 before their first birthday;
Whereas in 1991 approximately 375,000 babies will be born exposed to drugs, and
an estimated 100,000 of those babies will be born addicted to crack cocaine;
Whereas hospital costs for a drug exposed infant can be four times that of
an infant with no indication of drug exposure; and
Whereas in 1991 approximately 2,000 babies will be infected by the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (AIDS), and between 1989 and 1990 there has been a
24 percent increase in overall pediatric AIDS cases compared to a 15 percent
increase among adult AIDS cases: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress finds that the level of
 infant mortality is still too high and designates May 12, 1991, as `Infant
 Mortality Awareness Day', and the President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation encouraging the people of the United States to work
 toward the birth of healthy babies.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
