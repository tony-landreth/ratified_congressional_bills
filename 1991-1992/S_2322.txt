To amend title 38, United States Code, to increase, effective as of December 1,

survivors of such veterans.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled,

  This Act may be cited as the `Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living
  Adjustment Act of 1992'.
SEC. 2. DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION
RATE INCREASES.
  (a) IN GENERAL- (1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, as provided
  in paragraph (2), increase, effective December 1, 1992, the rates of and
  limitations on Department of Veterans Affairs disability compensation and
  dependency and indemnity compensation.

  in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and 1314 of title 38,
  United States Code, that were increased by the amendments made by the
  Veterans' Compensation Rate Amendments of 1991 (Public Law 102-152; 105
  Stat. 985). The increase shall be made in such rates and limitations as
  in effect on November 30, 1992, and shall be by the same percentage that

  of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)).
  (B) In the computation of increased rates and limitations pursuant to
  subparagraph (A), amounts of $0.50 or more shall be rounded to the next
  higher dollar amount and amounts of less than $0.50 shall be rounded to
  the next lower dollar amount.
  (b) SPECIAL RULE- The Secretary may adjust administratively, consistent
  with the increases made under subsection (a), the rates of disability
  compensation payable to persons within the purview of section 10 of Public
  Law 85-857 (2 Stat. 1263) who are not in receipt of compensation payable
  pursuant to chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code.
  (c) PUBLICATION REQUIREMENT- At the same time as the matters specified in
  section 214(i)(2)(D) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D))
  are required to be published by reason of a determination made under section
  215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 1992, the Secretary shall publish in
  the Federal Register the rates and limitations referred to in subsection
  (a)(2)(A) as increased under this section.
