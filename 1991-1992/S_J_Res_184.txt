S.J.Res.184
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the month of November 1991, as `National Accessible Housing Month'.
Whereas the Congress in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 found
that there are 43,000,000 individuals with disabilities in this Nation;
Whereas 70 percent of all Americans will, at some time in their lives, have a
temporary or permanent disability that will prevent them from  climbing stairs;
Whereas 32,000,000 Americans are currently over age 65 and many older
citizens acquire vision, hearing, and physical disabilities as part of the
aging process;
Whereas many older Americans who acquire a disability are forced to leave
their homes because the homes are no longer accessible to them;
Whereas 1 out of every 3 persons in the United States will need housing that
is accessible to the disabled at some point in their lives;
Whereas the need for accessible single-family homes is growing;
Whereas the need for public information and education in the area of accessible
single-family homes is increasing;
Whereas this Nation has placed a high priority on integrating Americans with
disabilities into our towns and communities;
Whereas the private sector has helped increase public awareness of the need
for accessible housing, as exemplified by the national public education
campaign conducted by the National Easter Seal Society and Century 21 Real
Estate Corporation, entitled `Easy Access Housing for Easier Living'; and
Whereas increased public awareness of the need for accessible housing
should prompt the participation of civic leaders, and representatives and
officials of State and local governments, in the drive to meet this need:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of November 1991, is designated
 as `National Accessible Housing Month'.  The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
