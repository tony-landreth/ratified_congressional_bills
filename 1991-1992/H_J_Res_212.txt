H.J.Res.212
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning February 16, 1992, as `National Visiting Nurse
Associations Week'.
Whereas visiting nurse associations have served homebound Americans since 1885;
Whereas such associations annually provide home care and support services
to more than 1,500,000, men, women, children, and infants;
Whereas such associations serve 422 urban and rural communities in 45 States;
Whereas such associations adhere to high standards of quality and provide
personalized and cost-effective home health care and support, regardless of
an individual's ability to pay;
Whereas such associations are voluntary in nature, independently owned,
and community based;
Whereas such associations ensure the quality of care through oversight provided
by professional advisory committees composed of local physicians and nurses;
Whereas such associations enable hundreds of thousands of Americans to
recover from illness and injury in the comfort and security of their homes;
Whereas such associations ensure that individuals who are chronically ill
or who have physical or mental handicaps receive the therapeutic benefits
of care and support services in the home;
Whereas, in the absence of such associations, thousands of patients with
mental or physical handicaps or chronically disabling illnesses would have
to be institutionalized;
Whereas such associations provide a wide range of services, including health
care, hospice care, personal care, homemaking, occupational, physical, and
speech therapy, friendly visiting services, social services, nutritional
counseling, specialized nursing care by registered nurses, and meals on wheels;
Whereas, in each community serviced by such an association, local volunteers
support the association by serving on the board of directors, raising funds,
visiting patients in their homes, assisting patients and nurses at wellness
clinics, delivering meals on wheels to patients, running errands for patients,
working in the association's office, and providing tender loving care; and
Whereas the need for home health care for young and old alike continues to
grow annually: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning February 16,
 1992, is designated as `National Visiting Nurse Associations Week', and
 the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 on the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
