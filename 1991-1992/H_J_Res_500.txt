AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating March 1993 as `Irish-American Heritage Month'.
Whereas by 1776 nearly 300,000 natives of Ireland had emigrated to the
colonies that would become the United States;
Whereas following the victory at Yorktown over the English, a French Major
General reported that the Congress owed its existence, and America possibly
owed its preservation, to the fidelity of the Irish;
Whereas at least 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence were of
Irish origin;
Whereas 18 Presidents have proudly proclaimed their Irish-American heritage;
Whereas 200 years ago, Irish-born James Hoban and Irish immigrants assisted
in the construction of the United States Capitol;
Whereas 190 years ago, Irish-born John Barry was the first naval hero of the
American Revolution and became known as the `Father of the United States Navy';
Whereas 180 years ago, Commodore Oliver Perry, an Irish-American, achieved
his major naval victory in the Battle of Lake Erie;
Whereas 50 years ago, the USS Sullivans was commissioned as a naval memorial
to the famed Irish-American Sullivan brothers who made the ultimate sacrifice
for democracy and freedom in the world; and
Whereas the Governors and mayors of 37 States and cities have designated
March 1993 as `Irish-American Heritage Month': Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That March 1993 is designated as
  `Irish-American Heritage Month', and the President is authorized and
  requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
  States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
