  river segments designated as components of the National Wild and Scenic
  Rivers System by this Act through cooperative agreements with the political
  jurisdictions within which such segments pass, pursuant to section 10(e) of
  the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and in consultation with such jurisdictions,
  except that publicly-owned lands within the boundaries of such segments shall
  continue to be managed by the agency having jurisdiction over such lands.
  (b) AGREEMENTS- (1) Cooperative agreements for management of the river
  segments referred to in subsection (a) shall provide for the long-term
  protection, preservation, and enhancement of such segments and shall be
  consistent with the comprehensive management plans for such segments to
  be prepared by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to section 3(d)
  of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and with local river management plans
  prepared by appropriate local political jurisdictions in conjunction with
  the Secretary of the Interior.
  (2) The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with appropriate
  representatives of local political jurisdictions and the State of New
  Jersey, shall review local river management plans described in paragraph
  (1) to assure that their proper implementation will protect the values
  for which the river segments described in subsection (a) were designated
  as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. If after
  such review the Secretary determines that such plans meet the protection
  standards for local zoning ordinances specified in section 6(c) of the
  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, such plans shall be deemed to constitute
  `local zoning ordinances' and each township and other incorporated local
  jurisdiction covered by such plans shall be deemed to constitute a `village'
  for the purposes of section 6(c) (prohibiting the acquisition of lands by
  condemnation) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
  (3) The Secretary of the Interior shall biennially review compliance
  with the local river management plans described in paragraph (1) and
  shall promptly report to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs
  of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural
  Resources of the Senate any deviation from such plans which could result
  in any diminution of the values for which the river segment concerned was
  designated as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
  (c) PLANNING ASSISTANCE- (1) The Secretary of the Interior may provide
  planning assistance to local political subdivisions of the State of New
  Jersey through which flow river segments that are designated as components
  of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and may enter into memoranda
  of understanding or cooperative agreements with officials or agencies
  of the United States or the State of New Jersey to ensure that Federal
  and State programs that could affect such segments are carried out in a
  manner consistent with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and applicable river
  management plans.
  (2)  For purposes of the planning assistance authorized and reviews required
  by this subsection, there are hereby authorized to be  appropriated not
  to exceed $70,000 annually.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
