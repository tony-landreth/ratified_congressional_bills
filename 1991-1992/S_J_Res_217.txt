S.J.Res.217
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To authorize and request the President to proclaim 1992 as the `Year of the
American Indian'.
Whereas American Indians are the original inhabitants of the lands that now
constitute the United States of America;
Whereas American Indian governments developed the fundamental principles
of freedom of speech and the separation of powers in government, and these
principles form the foundation of the United States Government today;
Whereas American Indian societies exhibited a respect for the finite quality
of natural resources through deep respect for the Earth, and such values
continue to be widely held today;
Whereas American Indian people have served with valor in all wars that the
United States has engaged in, from the Revolutionary War to the conflict
in the Persian Gulf, often serving in greater numbers, proportionately,
than the population of the Nation as a whole;
Whereas American Indians have made distinct and important contributions
to the United States and the rest of the world in many fields, including
agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art;
Whereas it is fitting that American Indians be recognized for their individual
contributions to American society as artists, sculptors, musicians, authors,
poets, artisans, scientists, and scholars;
Whereas the five hundredth anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus
to the Western Hemisphere is an especially appropriate occasion for the
people of the United States to reflect on the long history of the original
inhabitants of this continent and appreciate that the `discoverees' should
have as much recognition as the `discoverer';
Whereas the peoples of the world will be refocusing with special interest
on the significant contributions that American Indians have made to society;
Whereas the Congress believes that such recognition of their contributions
will promote self-esteem, pride, and self-awareness in American Indians
young and old; and
Whereas 1992 represents the first time that American Indians will have been
recognized through the commemoration of a year in their honor: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That 1992 is designated as the `Year of
 the American Indian'. The President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon Federal, State, and local governments, interested
 groups and organizations, and the people of the United States to observe
 the year with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
