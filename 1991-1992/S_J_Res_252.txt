S.J.Res. 252
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating the week of April 18 through 24, 1993, as `National Credit
Education Week'.
Whereas consumer credit is an integral part of the free enterprise economy
of the United States;
Whereas the vast array of credit products has increasingly complicated the
problems and opportunities for consumers;
Whereas the benefits consumers receive from using credit depend upon the
prudent use of credit and the prompt discharge of credit obligations;
Whereas educated consumers who know their choices, rights, and responsibilities
are better able to use credit wisely, thus increasing economic stability
and marketplace competition;
Whereas the increasing sophistication and complexity of the financial
marketplace necessitates that consumers be given simple and understandable
information about financial products in order to make informed decisions; and
Whereas businesses, schools, community organizations, and individuals should
educate the people of the United States concerning consumer credit: Now,
therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning April 18, 1993,
  is designated as `National Credit Education Week', and the President is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of
  the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
  and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
