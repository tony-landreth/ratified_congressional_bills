Joint Resolution
Commending the New York Stock Exchange on the occasion of its bicentennial.
Whereas, on May 17, 1792, the New York Stock Exchange was founded by
twenty-four merchants and brokers who gathered under a buttonwood tree in
lower Manhattan to establish a reliable market for the trading of securities;
Whereas the New York Stock Exchange has helped finance America's growth from
its very beginning, significantly contributing to job creation and to the
development of the Nation's industry and technology;
Whereas the New York Stock Exchange is both the Nation's and the world's
best known symbol of America's free enterprise system;
Whereas the New York Stock Exchange has committed its energy and expertise
to advance our Nation's free market philosophy to other countries around
the world; and
Whereas the New York Stock Exchange is a quasi-public institution, dedicated
to the promotion of individual and institutional investor protection, and
to just and equitable principles of trade: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the New York Stock Exchange is hereby
 commended on the occasion of its bicentennial. The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation acknowledging and commending this occasion.
