H.J.Res.175
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the weeks beginning December 1, 1991, and November 29, 1992, as
`National Home Care Week'.
Whereas organized home care services to the elderly and disabled have existed
in the United States since the last quarter of the 18th century;
Whereas home care is an effective and economical alternative to unnecessary
institutionalization;
Whereas caring for the ill and disabled in their homes places emphasis on
the dignity and independence of the individual receiving these services;
Whereas since the enactment of the medicare home care program, which provides
coverage for skilled nursing services, physical therapy, speech therapy,
social services, occupational therapy, and home health aide services, the
number of home care agencies in the United States providing these services
has increased from fewer than 1,275 to more than 12,000; and
Whereas many private and charitable organizations provide these and similar
services to millions of individuals each year preventing, postponing, and
limiting the need for them to become institutionalized to receive these
services: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the weeks beginning December 1, 1991,
 and November 29, 1992, are each designated as `National Home Care Week',
 and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe such weeks with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
