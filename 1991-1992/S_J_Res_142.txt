S.J.Res. 142
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning July 28, 1991, as `National Juvenile Arthritis
Awareness Week'.
Whereas over 250,000 children in the United States are affected by the
debilitating disease known as Juvenile Arthritis;
Whereas this crippling condition attacks the joints and major organs of the
human body--heart, liver, spleen, and even eyes;
Whereas this disease is often lifelong, affecting children into their
adulthood, making even simple tasks seem difficult and frustrating, affecting
the quality of life for our future citizens and leaders;
Whereas Juvenile Arthritis can be controlled reasonably well in most people,
but it can prove fatal in some instances; and
Whereas the commitment to research and education efforts to develop a greater
understanding about Juvenile Arthritis should be encouraged and continued:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning July 28, 1991, is
 designated as `National Juvenile Arthritis Awareness Week'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
