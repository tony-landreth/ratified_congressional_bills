-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `(2) SMALL BUSINESS EXCEPTION- Any business which has fewer than 500
  employees, including employees of affiliates, and which does not have a
  prescription drug product introduced or delivered for introduction into
  interstate commerce shall pay one-half the amount of the fee for human
  drug applications it submits and shall pay the entire amount of the fee
  for supplements it submits. Such a business shall not be required to pay
  any portion of any fee required under subsection (a)(1)(A) until 1 year
  after the date of the submission of the application involved. For purposes
  of this paragraph, one business is an affiliate of another business when,
  directly or indirectly, one business controls, or has the power to control,
  the other business or a third party controls, or has the power to control,
  both businesses.
  `(c) INCREASES AND ADJUSTMENTS-
  `(1) REVENUE INCREASE- The total fee revenues established by the schedule in
  subsection (b)(1) shall be increased by the Secretary by notice, published
  in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year to reflect the greater of--
  `(A) the total percentage increase that occurred during the preceding
  fiscal year in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items;
  U.S. city average), or
  `(B) the total percentage increase for such fiscal year in basic pay
  under the General Schedule in accordance with section 5332 of title 5,
  United States Code, as adjusted by any locality-based comparability payment
  pursuant to section 5304 of such title for Federal employees stationed in
  the District of Columbia.
  `(2) ANNUAL FEE ADJUSTMENT- Subject to the amount appropriated for a fiscal
  year under subsection (g), the Secretary shall, within 60 days after the
  end of each fiscal year beginning after October 1, 1992, adjust the fees
  established by the schedule in subsection (b)(1) for the following fiscal
  year to achieve the total fee revenues, as may be increased under paragraph
  (1). Such fees shall be adjusted under this paragraph to maintain the
  proportions established in such schedule.
  `(3) LIMIT- The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under paragraph
  (2), for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal
  year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of human
  drug applications.
  `(d) FEE WAIVER OR REDUCTION- The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or
  a reduction of 1 or more fees under subsection (a) where the Secretary
  finds that--
  `(1) such waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health,
  `(2) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to
  innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other
  circumstances,
  `(3) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the anticipated present
  and future costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for
  the review of human drug applications for such person, or
  `(4) assessment of the fee for an application or a supplement filed under
  section 505(b)(1) pertaining to a drug containing an active ingredient
  would be inequitable because an application for a product containing the
  same active ingredient filed by another person under section 505(b)(2)
  could not be assessed fees under subsection (a)(1).
In making the finding in paragraph (3), the Secretary may use standard costs.
  `(e) EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PAY FEES- A human drug application or supplement
  submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be
  considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary
  until all fees owed by such person have been paid.
  `(f) ASSESSMENT OF FEES-
  `(1) LIMITATION- Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for a fiscal
  year beginning after fiscal year 1993 unless appropriations for salaries
  and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year
  (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are
  equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries
  and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 1992
  multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.
  `(2) AUTHORITY- If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection
  (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if
  at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees,
  the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification
  in the rate, for human drug applications and supplements, prescription
  drug establishments, and prescription drug products at any time in such
  fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to
  the date fees are to be paid.
  `(g) CREDITING AND AVAILABILITY OF FEES-
  `(1) IN GENERAL- Fees collected for a fiscal year pursuant to subsection (a)
  shall be credited to the appropriation account for salaries and expenses
  of the Food and Drug Administration and shall be available in accordance
  with appropriation Acts until expended without fiscal year limitation.
  `(2) COLLECTIONS AND APPROPRIATION ACTS- The fees authorized by this
  section--
  `(A) shall be collected in each fiscal year in an amount equal to the
  amount specified in appropriation Acts for such fiscal year, and
  `(B) shall only be collected and available to defray increases in the costs
  of the resources allocated for the process for the review of human drug
  applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number
  of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human
  Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs for fiscal year
  1992 multiplied by the adjustment factor.
  `(3) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS- There are authorized to be appropriated
  for fees under this section--
  `(A) $36,000,000 for fiscal year 1993,
  `(B) $54,000,000 for fiscal year 1994,
  `(C) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1995,
  `(D) $78,000,000 for fiscal year 1996, and
  `(E) $84,000,000 for fiscal year 1997,
as adjusted to reflect increases in the total fee revenues made under
subsection (c)(1).
  `(h) COLLECTION OF UNPAID FEES- In any case where the Secretary does not
  receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days
  after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United
  States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31,
  United States Code.
  `(i) CONSTRUCTION- This section may not be construed to require that the
  number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and
  Human Services, for officers, employers, and advisory committees not engaged
  in the process of the review of human drug applications, be reduced to offset
  the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.'.
SEC. 104. ANNUAL REPORTS.
  (a) FIRST REPORT- Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year during
  which fees are collected under part 2 of subchapter C of chapter VII of
  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Secretary of Health and Human
  Services shall submit a report stating the Food and Drug Administration's
  progress in achieving the goals identified in section 102(3) of this
  Act during such fiscal year and that agency's future plans for meeting
  such goals.

  of the fees collected during such fiscal year for which the report is made.
