H.J.Res.149
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating March 1991 and March 1992 both as `Women's History Month'.
Whereas American women of every race, class, and ethnic background have made
historic contributions to the growth and strength of our Nation in countless
recorded and unrecorded ways;
Whereas American women have played and continue to play a critical economic,
cultural, and social role in every sphere of the life of the Nation by
constituting a significant portion of the labor force working inside and
outside of the home;
Whereas American women have played a unique role throughout the history of the
Nation by providing the majority of the volunteer labor force of the Nation;
Whereas American women were particularly important in the establishment of
early charitable, philanthropic, and cultural institutions in our Nation;
Whereas American women of every race, class, and ethnic background served
as early leaders in the forefront of every major progressive social change
movement;
Whereas American women have been leaders not only in securing their own rights
of suffrage and equal opportunity, but also in the abolitionist movement,
the emancipation movement, the industrial labor movement, the civil rights
movement, and other movements, especially the peace movement, which create
a more fair and just society for all; and
Whereas despite these contributions, the role of American women in history
has been consistently overlooked and undervalued in the literature, teaching,
and study of American history: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That March 1991 and March 1992 are designated
 both as `Women's History Month', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe that month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
