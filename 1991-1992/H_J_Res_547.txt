H.J.Res.547
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating May 2, 1993, through May 8, 1993, as `National Walking Week'.
Whereas medical authorities have established that walking--
  (1) powerfully protects against high blood pressure, cholesterol problems,
  and other factors that can contribute to heart disease;
  (2) protects against adult onset (Type II) diabetes;
  (3) builds strong bones and protects against osteoporosis, the weak-bone
  disease that afflicts millions of older women;
  (4) probably offers protection against several forms of cancer that are
  believed to be preventable through regular and moderate exercise; and
  (5) is a safe and dependable way for millions of overweight people to lose
  weight without stringent dieting;
Whereas the failure to regular exercise such as walking has been identified
as the single greatest risk factor for heart disease;
Whereas the designation of `National Walking Week' will help promote the
issue of pedestrian access and safety;
Whereas areas of America are becoming inaccessible or unsafe for walkers,
so the benefits of this activity are being blocked;
Whereas people should be able to walk anywhere in their community, within
reason; and
Whereas walking encourages community spirit and safety: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That May 2, 1993, through May 8, 1993,
  is designated as `National Walking Week'. The President is authorized and
  requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
  States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
