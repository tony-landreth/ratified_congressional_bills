AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of October 1991, as `Country Music Month'.
Whereas country music derives its roots from the folk songs of our Nation's
workers, captures the spirit of our religious hymns, reflects the sorrow
and joy of our traditional ballads, and echoes the drive and soulfulness of
rhythm and blues;
Whereas country music has played an integral part in our Nation's history,
accompanying the growth of the United States and reflecting the ethnic and
cultural diversity of our people;
Whereas country music embodies the spirit of America and the deep and genuine
feelings individuals experience throughout their lives;
Whereas the distinctively American refrains of country music have been
performed for audiences throughout the world, striking a chord deep within
the hearts and souls of its fans; and
Whereas the month of October 1991 marks the twenty-seventh annual observance
of Country Music Month: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of October 1991, be designated
 as `Country Music Month' and that the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
