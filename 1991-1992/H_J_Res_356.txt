One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating December 1991 as `Bicentennial of the District of Columbia Month'.
Whereas the year 1991 is recognized as the 200th anniversary of the District
of Columbia because many of the events important to the founding of the
Nation's Capital occurred during that year;
Whereas on January 24, 1791, George Washington selected the site along the
Potomac River as the district for the permanent seat of the Government of
the United States where the vision of the infant nation dedicated to the
principles of self-government could be realized;
Whereas in February 1791, Andrew Ellicott and Benjamin Banneker began to
survey the new district, which would become the center of a continent and
leader of the free world;
Whereas on September 9, 1791, the Commissioners charged with the founding of
the city informed Major Pierre L'Enfant that the Federal district was to be
called the Territory of Columbia and the Federal city the City of Washington;
Whereas on December 13, 1791, L'Enfant's grand plan for the development of
the Nation's Capital, which included magnificent vistas, radiating avenues,
beautiful parks and promenades, cascading fountains, and public spaces
for national monuments, and which reflected the patriotic enthusiasm that
the Federal city forever serve as a temple to liberty, was submitted to
the Congress;
Whereas on December 19, 1791, the State of Maryland forever ceded and
relinquished to the Congress and the Government of the United States the
final land grant to form the new district;
Whereas the creation of the District of Columbia was an important act of
self-government by the first Federal Congress designed to strengthen and
preserve the political institutions of a free people, and the District itself
is a time-honored symbol of the Republic;
Whereas the grandeur and beauty of the District of Columbia are acclaimed
throughout the world;
Whereas the sacrifices of a people dedicated to freedom are forever remembered
in the inspiring memorials located in the District of Columbia;
Whereas the people of the District of Columbia have made contributions to
the arts, law, music, and culture that have been recognized throughout the
Nation and the world;
Whereas the District of Columbia is a national treasure as the repository
of much of our Nation's history; and
Whereas the District of Columbia is truly where the people of the United
States, through our elected representatives, exercise the right of
self-governance: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That December 1991 is designated as
 `Bicentennial of the District of Columbia Month', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation--
 (1) honoring the 200th anniversary of the founding of the District of
 Columbia as the Nation's Capital; and
 (2) calling upon the people of the United States to observe such month with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
