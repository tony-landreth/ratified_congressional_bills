One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate July 5, 1992, through July 11, 1992, as `National Awareness Week
for Life-Saving Techniques'.
Whereas the National Safety Council reported that about 850,000 Americans
died in 1990 as a result of accidents and heart disease;
Whereas accidents are the leading cause of death for children and youth ages
1 to 24 years;
Whereas drowning and choking are a leading cause of accidental death in
children under the age of 5 years;
Whereas Rescue Breathing and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, commonly referred
to as CPR, are life-saving techniques that significantly reduce the incidence
of sudden death due to accidents and heart disease;
Whereas it is critical that more Americans learn such basic life-saving
techniques in order to reduce the number of deaths related to accidents and
heart disease;
Whereas the opportunity to learn basic life-saving techniques is available to
all Americans through the American Red Cross, the American Heart Association,
the YMCA, and other national organizations; and
Whereas the death rate due to accidents and heart disease would be greatly
reduced if more Americans received training in basic life-saving techniques:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That July 5, 1992, through July 11, 1992,
 is designated as `National Awareness Week for Life-Saving Techniques'. The
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the
 people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities designed to encourage training in life-saving techniques
 for Americans.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
