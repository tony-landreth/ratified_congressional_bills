Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To recognize contributions Federal civilian employees provided during the
attack on
Pearl Harbor and during World War II.
Whereas on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, at 7:55 a.m., the first wave
of dive and high level bombers from the Imperial Japanese Combined Fleet
attacked Hickam and Wheeler Airfields in the United States territory of Hawaii;
Whereas the first bombs fell on Ford Island at Pearl Harbor;
Whereas American fighter planes were strafed and destroyed on the ground at
Pearl Harbor, Hickam Airfield, Kaneohe Naval Air Station, Bellows Airfield,
Ewa Marine Corps Air Station, Schofield Barracks, and Wheeler Airfield;
Whereas the United States Pacific Fleet was devastated, but its carriers
were still afloat, and Pearl Harbor's shipyards, fuel storage area, and
submarine base remarkably suffered very little damage;
Whereas Federal civilian employees responded magnificently that fateful
morning and met their country's call to duty with distinction and valor;
Whereas Federal civilian employees were instrumental in the remarkable
salvage effort to raise and repair several of the naval vessels that were
put back in action before the end of World War II;
Whereas of the 2,403 Americans killed in connection with the attack on Pearl
Harbor, 68 were civilians, and of the 1,178 Americans wounded in connection
with the attack, 35 were civilians;
Whereas Federal civilian employees exhibited the highest sense of patriotism
and exemplary performance at Pearl Harbor and during World War II;
Whereas on December 4, 1991, ceremonies coordinated by the National Park
Service will be held in the State of Hawaii to recognize the contributions
of Federal civilian employees; and
Whereas we should honor these distinguished individuals during the
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That December 4, 1991, is designated as
 `Federal Civilian Employees Remembrance Day'.  The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities recognizing
 the important contributions Federal civilian employees provided during the
 attack on Pearl Harbor and during World War II, and thanking such dedicated
 and committed individuals for their sacrifice and devotion to their country.
