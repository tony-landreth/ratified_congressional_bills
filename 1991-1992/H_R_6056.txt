  seek the death penalty for an offense under this  section, the attorney
  for the government shall file with the court and serve on the defendant
  a notice of such intent. The notice shall be provided a reasonable time
  before the trial or acceptance of a guilty plea, or at such later time
  as the court may permit for good  cause. The notice shall set forth the
  aggravating factor or factors set forth in subsection (e) and any other
  aggravating factor or factors that the government will seek to prove as
  the basis for the death penalty. The  factors for which notice is provided
  under this subsection may include factors concerning the effect of the

  `(g) JUDGE AND JURY AT CAPITAL SENTENCING HEARING- A hearing to determine
  whether the death penalty will be imposed for an offense under this section
  shall be conducted by the judge who presided at trial or accepted a guilty
  plea, or by another judge if that judge is not  available. The hearing
  shall be conducted before the jury that determined the defendant's  guilt
  if that jury is available. A new jury shall be impaneled for the purpose
  of the hearing if the defendant pleaded guilty, the trial of guilt was
  conducted without a jury, the jury that determined the defendant's guilt was
  discharged for good cause, or  reconsideration of the sentence is necessary
  after the initial imposition of a sentence of  death. A jury impaneled
  under this subsection shall have 12 members unless the parties stipulate to
  a lesser number at any time before the conclusion of the hearing with the
  approval of the court. Upon motion of the defendant, with the approval of
  the attorney for the government, the hearing shall be carried out before the
  judge without a jury. If there is no jury, references to `the jury' in this
  section, where applicable, shall be understood as referring to the judge.
  `(h) PROOF OF MITIGATING AND AGGRAVATING FACTORS- No presentence report shall
  be prepared if a capital sentencing hearing is held under this section. Any
  information relevant to the existence of mitigating factors, or to the
  existence of aggravating factors for which notice has been provided under
  subsection (f), may be presented by either the government or the defendant,
  regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing the admission of
  evidence at criminal trials, except that information may be excluded if its
  probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,
  confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. The information presented
  may include trial transcripts and exhibits. The attorney for the government
  and for the defendant shall be permitted to rebut any information received
  at the hearing, and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument
  as to the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any
  aggravating or mitigating factor, and as to the appropriateness in that
  case of imposing a sentence of death. The attorney for the government
  shall open the argument, the defendant shall be permitted to reply, and
  the government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.
  `(i) FINDINGS OF AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS- The jury shall return
  special findings identifying any aggravating factor or factors for which
  notice has been provided under subsection (f) and which the jury unanimously
  determines have been established by the government beyond a reasonable
  doubt. A mitigating factor is established if the defendant has proven its
  existence by a preponderance of the evidence, and any member of the jury
  who finds the existence of such a factor may regard it as established for
  purposes of this section regardless of the number of jurors who concur
  that the factor has been established.
  `(j) FINDING CONCERNING A SENTENCE OF DEATH- If the jury specially finds
  under subsection (i) that 1 or more aggravating factors set forth in
  subsection (e) exist, and the jury further finds unanimously that there are
  no mitigating factors or that the aggravating factor or factors specially
  found under subsection (i) outweigh any mitigating factors, the jury
  shall recommend a sentence of death. In any other case, the jury shall not
  recommend a sentence of death. The jury shall be instructed that it must
  avoid any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice, or other
  arbitrary factors in its decision, and should make such a recommendation
  as the information warrants.
  `(k) SPECIAL PRECAUTION TO ASSURE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION- In a hearing held
  before a jury, the court, before the return of a finding under subsection
  (j), shall instruct the jury that, in considering whether to recommend
  a sentence of death, it shall not consider the race, color, religion,
  national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim, and that the jury
  is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that it
  would recommend a sentence of death for such a crime regardless of the race,
  color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim. The
  jury, upon the return of a finding under subsection (j), shall also return
  to the court a certificate, signed by each juror, that the race, color,
  religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim did not
  affect the juror's individual decision and that the individual juror would
  have recommended the same sentence for such a crime regardless of the race,
  color, religion, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim.
  `(l) IMPOSITION OF A SENTENCE OF DEATH- Upon a recommendation under
  subsection (j) that a sentence of death be imposed, the court shall sentence
  the defendant to death. Otherwise the court shall impose a sentence of
  life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
  `(m) Review of a Sentence of Death-
  `(1) The defendant may appeal a sentence of death under this section by
  filing a notice of appeal of the sentence within the time provided for
  filing a notice of appeal of the judgment of conviction. An appeal of a
  sentence under this subsection may be consolidated within an appeal of
  the judgment of conviction and shall have priority over all noncapital
  matters in the court of appeals.
  `(2) The court of appeals shall review the entire record in the case
  including the evidence submitted at trial and information submitted during
  the sentencing hearing, the procedures employed in the sentencing hearing,
  and the special findings returned under subsection (i). The court of
  appeals shall uphold the sentence if it determines that the sentence of
  death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any
  other arbitrary factor, that the evidence and information support the
  special findings under subsection (i), and that the proceedings were
  otherwise free of prejudicial error that was properly preserved for review.
  `(3) In any other case, the court of appeals shall remand the case for
  reconsideration of the sentence or imposition of another authorized sentence
  as appropriate, except that the court shall not reverse a sentence of death
  on the ground that an aggravating factor was invalid or was not supported by
  the evidence and information if at least one aggravating factor described
  in subsection (e) remains which was found to exist and the court, on the
  basis of the evidence submitted at trial and the information submitted
  at the sentencing hearing, finds that the remaining aggravating factor
  or factors that were found to exist outweigh any mitigating factors. The
  court of appeals shall state in writing the reasons for its disposition
  of an appeal of a sentence of death under this section.
  `(n) IMPLEMENTATION OF SENTENCE OF DEATH- A person sentenced to death under
  this section shall be committed to the custody of the Attorney General
  until exhaustion of the procedures for appeal of the judgment of conviction
  and review of the sentence. When the sentence is to be implemented, the
  Attorney General shall release the person sentenced to death to the custody
  of a United States Marshal. The Marshal shall supervise implementation
  of the sentence in the manner prescribed by the law of a State designated
  by the court. The Marshal may use State or local facilities, may use the
  services of an appropriate State or local official or of a person such an
  official employs, and shall pay the costs thereof in an amount approved
  by the Attorney General.
  `(o) SPECIAL BAR TO EXECUTION- A sentence of death shall not be carried
  out upon a woman while she is pregnant.
  `(p) CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION TO PARTICIPATION IN EXECUTION- No employee
  of the District of Columbia government, and no person providing services
  to the government under contract shall be required, as a condition of
  that employment or contractual obligation, to be in attendance at or
  to participate in any execution carried out under this section if such
  participation is contrary to the moral or religious convictions of the
  employee. For purposes of this subsection, the term `participate in any
  execution' includes personal preparation of the condemned individual and
  the apparatus used for the execution, and supervision of the activities
  of other personnel in carrying out such activities.
  `(q) APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL FOR INDIGENT CAPITAL DEFENDANTS- A defendant
  against whom a sentence of death is sought, or on whom a sentence of death
  has been imposed, under this section, shall be entitled to appointment
  of counsel from the commencement of trial proceedings until one of the
  conditions specified in subsection (v) has occurred, if the defendant is or
  becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation. Counsel shall
  be appointed for trial representation as provided in chapter 26 of title
  11 of the District of Columbia Code (D.C. Code 11-2601 et seq.), and at
  least one counsel so appointed shall continue to represent the defendant
  until the conclusion of direct review of the judgment, unless replaced
  by the court with other qualified counsel. Except as otherwise provided
  in this section, chapter 26 of title 11 of the District of Columbia Code
  (D.C. Code 11-2601 et seq.) shall apply to appointments under this section.
  `(r) REPRESENTATION AFTER FINALITY OF JUDGMENT- When a judgment imposing a
  sentence of death under this section has become final through affirmance by
  the Supreme Court on direct review, denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court
  on direct review, or expiration of the time for seeking direct review in the
  court of appeals or the Supreme Court, the government shall promptly notify
  the court that imposed the sentence. The court, within 10 days of receipt
  of such notice, shall proceed to make determination whether the defendant
  is eligible for appointment of counsel for subsequent proceedings. The
  court shall issue an order appointing one or more counsel to represent the
  defendant upon a finding that the defendant is financially unable to obtain
  adequate representation and wishes to have counsel appointed or is unable
  competently to decide whether to accept or reject appointment of counsel. The
  court shall issue an order denying appointment of counsel upon a finding
  that the defendant is financially able to obtain adequate representation or
  that the defendant rejected appointment of counsel with an understanding
  of the consequences of that decision. Counsel appointed pursuant to this
  subsection shall be different from the counsel who represented the defendant
  at trial and on direct review unless the defendant and counsel request a
  continuation or renewal of the earlier representation.
  `(s) STANDARDS FOR COMPETENCE OF COUNSEL- In relation to a defendant who is
  entitled to appointment of counsel under subsection (q) or (r), at least
  one counsel appointed for trial representation must have been admitted to
  the bar for at least 5 years and have at least 3 years of experience in
  the trial of felony cases in the Federal district courts. If new counsel
  is appointed after judgment, at least one counsel so appointed must have
  been admitted to the bar for at least 5 years and have at least 3 years
  of experience in the litigation of felony cases in the Federal courts
  of appeals or the Supreme Court. The court, for good cause, may appoint
  counsel who does not meet these standards, but whose background, knowledge,
  or experience would otherwise enable him or her to properly represent the
  defendant, with due consideration of the seriousness of the penalty and
  the nature of the litigation.
  `(t) CLAIMS OF INEFFECTIVENESS OF COUNSEL IN COLLATERAL PROCEEDINGS- The
  ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during proceedings on a motion
  under section 23-110 of the District of Columbia Code in a case under this
  section shall not be a ground for relief from the judgment or sentence
  in any proceeding. This limitation shall not preclude the appointment of
  different counsel at any stage of the proceedings.
  `(u) TIME FOR COLLATERAL ATTACK ON DEATH SENTENCE- A motion under section
  23-110 of the District of Columbia Code attacking a sentence of death
  under this section, or the conviction on which it is predicated, shall
  be filed within 90 days of the issuance of the order under subsection (r)
  appointing or denying the appointment of counsel for such proceedings. The
  court in which the motion is filed, for good cause shown, may extend the
  time for filing for a period not exceeding 60 days. Such a motion shall
  have priority over all non-capital matters in the district court, and in
  the court of appeals on review of the district court's decision.
  `(v) STAY OF EXECUTION- The execution of a sentence of death under this
  section shall be stayed in the course of direct review of the judgment
  and during the litigation of an initial motion in the case under section
  23-110 of the District of Columbia Code. The stay shall run continuously
  following imposition of the sentence and shall expire if--
  `(1) the defendant fails to file a motion under section 23-110 of the
  District of Columbia Code within the time specified in subsection (u), or
  fails to make a timely application for court of appeals review following
  the denial of such a motion by a district court;
  `(2) upon completion of district court and court of appeals review
  under section 23-110 of the District of Columbia Code, the Supreme Court
  disposes of a petition for certiorari in a manner that leaves the capital
  sentence undisturbed, or the defendant fails to file a timely petition
  for certiorari; or
  `(3) before a district court, in the presence of counsel and after having
  been advised of the consequences of such a decision, the defendant waives the
  right to file a motion under section 23-110 of the District of Columbia Code.
  `(w) FINALITY OF THE DECISION ON REVIEW- If one of the conditions specified
  in subsection (v) has occurred, no court thereafter shall have the authority
  to enter a stay of execution or grant relief in the case unless--
  `(1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not presented
  in earlier proceedings;
  `(2) the failure to raise the claim is the result of governmental action in
  violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, the result of
  the Supreme Court's recognition of a new Federal right that is retroactively
  applicable, or the result of the fact that the factual predicate of the
  claim could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable
  diligence in time to present the claim in earlier proceedings; and
  `(3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient, if proven, to
  undermine the court's confidence in the determination of guilt on the
  offense or offenses for which the death penalty was imposed.
  `(x) COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE OF DEATH- The Mayor shall have power to commute
  a sentence of death under this section to a sentence of life imprisonment,
  without parole.
