one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate October 19 through 27, 1991 as `National Red Ribbon Week for
a Drug-Free America'.
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions and
is of major concern to all Americans;
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse is a major public health threat and is
one of the largest causes of preventable disease, disability and death in
the United States today;
Whereas illegal drug use is not limited to persons of a particular age,
gender, or socioeconomic status;
Whereas the drug problem appears to be insurmountable, but the United States
has begun to lay the foundation to combat the use of illegal drugs;
Whereas the United States must continue the important strides made to combat
alcohol and other drug abuse;
Whereas it has been demonstrated through public opinion polls that the American
people consider drug abuse one of the most serious domestic problems facing
the United States and have begun to take steps against it;
Whereas the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth has declared
October 19-October 27, 1991 as `National Red Ribbon Week', has organized
the National Red Ribbon Campaign to coordinate the week's activities, has
established the theme, `Neighbors--Drug Free and Proud' for the week, and
has called for a comprehensive public awareness, prevention, and education
program involving thousands of parent and community groups across the country;
Whereas the National Red Ribbon Campaign is headed by President and Mrs. George
Bush and national honorary chairmen;
Whereas any use of an illegal drug is unacceptable and the illegal use of
a legal drug cannot be tolerated; and
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse destroys lives, spawns crime, undermines
our economy, and threatens our security as a Nation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) the period of October 19-27, 1991 is designated as `National Red Ribbon
 Week for a Drug Free America';
 (2) the President is authorized and directed to issue a proclamation calling
 on the people of the United States--
 (A) to observe the week by holding conferences, meetings and other activities
 to support community and alcohol education, and with other appropriate
 activities, events and educational campaigns; and
 (B) both during the week and thereafter, to wear and display red ribbons
 to present and symbolize commitment to a healthy, drug-free life style,
 and to develop an attitude of intolerance concerning the use of drugs; and
 (3) Congress recognizes and commends the hard work and dedication of
 concerned parents, youth, law enforcement officials, educators, business
 leaders, religious leaders, private sector organizations, and Government
 leaders in combatting the abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
