S.J.Res. 271
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the peace process in Liberia and
authorizing limited assistance to support this process.
Whereas the civil war in Liberia, begun in December 1989, has devastated
that country, killing an estimated 25,000 civilians and forcing hundreds of
thousands of Liberians to flee their homes;
Whereas in an effort to end the fighting, the parties to the Liberian
conflict and the leaders of the West African states signed a peace accord
in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire on October 30, 1991;
Whereas this agreement sets in motion a peace process, including the encampment
and disarmament of the fighters and culminating in the holding of free and
fair elections;
Whereas despite several difficulties, this peace process continues to proceed
largely on track, including the recent opening of roads in Liberia and the
initiation of the political campaigns by several parties; and
Whereas the election process outlined in the Yamoussoukro agreement is
essential for reestablishing peace, democracy and reconciliation in Liberia,
and limited United States assistance could play an important role in promoting
this process: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That (a) the Congress--
 (1) strongly supports the peace process for Liberia initiated by the
 Yamoussoukro peace accord;
 (2) urges all parties to abide by the terms of the Yamoussoukro agreement;
 (3) commends and congratulates the governments of the Economic Community
 of West African States (ECOWAS) for their leadership in seeking peace in
 Liberia; and
 (4) extends particularly praise to President Babangida of Nigeria, President
 Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, and President Diouf of Senegal for their
 efforts to resolve this conflict.
 (b) AUTHORIZATION OF LIMITED ASSISTANCE- Notwithstanding section 620(q) of
 the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any similar provision, the President
 is authorized to provide--
 (1) nonpartisan election and democracy-building assistance to support
 democratic institutions in Liberia, and
 (2) assistance for the resettlement of refugees, the demobilization and
 retraining of troops, and the provision of other appropriate assistance to
 implement the Yamoussoukro peace accord:
Provided, That the President determines and so certifies to the Committee
on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and
the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives that Liberia has made significant progress toward
democratization and that the provision of such assistance will assist that
country in making further progress and is otherwise in the national interest
of the United States. A separate determination and certification shall be
required for each fiscal year in which such assistance is to be provided.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
