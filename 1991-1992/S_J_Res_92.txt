S.J.Res. 92
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
To designate July 28, 1992, as `Buffalo Soldiers Day'.
Whereas the Congress responded to the brave Civil War service of more than
180,000 African-American troops by voting on July 28, 1866, to create 6
regular Army regiments composed of African-American enlisted soldiers;
Whereas the 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments were among those regiments,
which consisted of veterans of the Civil War and free men of color;
Whereas the 9th Cavalry was stationed at Greenville, Louisiana, and the 10th
Cavalry was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from where they played
a key role in the history of the American West, guarding wagon trains,
surveying roads, building forts, and protecting settlers;
Whereas after a battle in 1867 near Fort Hays, Kansas, Cheyenne warriors
remarked that the African-American soldiers fought as fiercely as buffaloes,
and the cavalry thereafter adopted the name `Buffalo Soldiers' as a badge
of honor;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers were an important part of American history
and served the United States in many States and Nations, including Arizona,
California, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Texas,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Cuba, Mexico, and the Philippines;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers' military heroics included serving with Theodore
Roosevelt and the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War, and helping
to capture Billy the Kid and Pancho Villa;
Whereas some Buffalo Soldiers became famous African-American military officers,
including Henry Flipper, Charles Young, and Benjamin Davis;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers served with pride and maintained high morale and
the lowest desertion rate in the Army, despite receiving the worst equipment
and food, living in inadequate housing, and being subjected to discrimination;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers were repeatedly cited for heroism and dedication
to duty, including numerous campaign and unit citations, as well as 22
individual Congressional Medals of Honor;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers served in the highest tradition of the United
States military, but still have not been given their proper place in American
history;
Whereas General Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recognized
this omission in 1982 while serving as Deputy Commander at Fort Leavenworth,
and set in motion efforts to construct a monument to these forgotten heroes;
Whereas a monument to the Buffalo Soldiers will be dedicated at Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, in July 1992, on a site where Buffalo Soldiers camped
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and
Whereas the Buffalo Soldier Monument will appropriately recognize the great
sacrifices and outstanding performance of the Buffalo Soldiers and their
contributions to our Nation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That July 28, 1992, is designated as
 `Buffalo Soldiers Day', and the President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe
 such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
