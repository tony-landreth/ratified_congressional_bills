AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To designate October 1991 as `Crime Prevention Month'.
Whereas crime prevention improves the quality of life in every community;
Whereas crime prevention is a cost-effective answer to the problems caused
by crime, drug abuse, and fear of crime;
Whereas crime prevention is central to a sound criminal justice system at
national, State, and local levels;
Whereas more than 27,000,000 people in the United States are actively engaged
in helping their communities to prevent the commission of crimes against
persons and property;
Whereas millions of citizens have demonstrated that, by working together,
they can reduce crime, drug abuse, and fear of crime;
Whereas all people of the United States, from preschoolers to senior citizens,
can help themselves, their families, and their neighborhoods to prevent
crime and to build safer and more caring environments;
Whereas an important challenge facing all people and groups in the United
States (including individuals, State and local agencies, civic and community
groups, religious institutions, schools, businesses, and law enforcement
agencies) is to weave methods into daily life that prevent crime and become
part of society's norms;
Whereas it is important to annually honor persons who work throughout society
to prevent crime and to build and sustain the Nation's communities; and
Whereas the National Citizens Crime Prevention Campaign (featuring McGruff
the Crime Dog and promoted by the Department of Justice, the National
Crime Prevention Council, the Advertising Council, and the Crime Prevention
Coalition) promotes diverse partnerships among law enforcement agencies,
citizens, businesses, and government to reduce crime and to improve community
life throughout the Nation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1991 is designated as `Crime
 Prevention Month', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe the
 month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
