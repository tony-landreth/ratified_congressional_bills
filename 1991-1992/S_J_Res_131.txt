S.J.Res.131
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating October 1991 as `National Down Syndrome Awareness Month'.
Whereas a more enlightened attitude has emerged during the past 15 years in
the care and training of the developmentally disabled;
Whereas one disability which has undergone considerable reevaluation is
Down syndrome;
Whereas approximately 4,000 babies are born with Down syndrome annually in
the United States;
Whereas, until recently, Down syndrome was stigmatized as a mentally and
physically retarding condition that required institutionalization and
restricted its victims to lives of passivity;
Whereas remaining ignorance, prejudices, myths, and stereotypes regarding
Down syndrome can be overcome only through increased awareness and education;
Whereas, through the efforts of concerned physicians, teachers, and parent
groups, such as the National Down Syndrome Congress and the National Down
Syndrome Society, programs are being put into place to educate the parents of
babies with Down syndrome, to develop special education classes for individuals
with Down syndrome within mainstreamed school programs, to provide vocational
training for individuals with Down syndrome in preparation for entering the
workforce, and to prepare young adults with  Down syndrome for independent
living in the community;
Whereas the television medium has greatly augmented such efforts by casting
actors with Down syndrome and offering programming that demonstrates to
hundreds of thousands of viewers in a positive and educational manner the
everyday, personal, and family effects of living with Down syndrome;
Whereas the cost of programs designed to help individuals with  Down syndrome
enter their rightful place in society as productive citizens is a small
fraction of the cost of institutionalization;
Whereas advancements in genetic research are also offering a brighter outlook
for individuals born with Down syndrome; and
Whereas the many children with Down syndrome who attend regular schools, play
on Little League teams, and enjoy basketball and golf demonstrate daily the
success that people with Down syndrome are able to achieve: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1991 is designated as `National
 Down Syndrome Awareness Month'.  The President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
