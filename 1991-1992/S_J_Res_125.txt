AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate October 1991 as `Polish-American Heritage Month'.
Whereas the first Polish immigrants to North America were among the first
settlers of Jamestown, Virginia, in the seventeenth century;
Whereas Kazimierz Pulaski, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, and other Poles came to the
British colonies in America to fight in the Revolutionary War and to risk
their lives and fortunes for the creation of the United States;
Whereas Poles and Americans of Polish descent have distinguished themselves
by contribution to the development of arts, sciences, government, military
service, athletics, and education in the United States;
Whereas the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791, was modeled directly on
the Constitution of the United States, is recognized as the second written
constitution in history, and is revered by Poles and Americans of Polish
descent;
Whereas Poles and Americans of Polish descent take great pride and honor in
the greatest son of Poland, his Holiness Pope John Paul the Second;
Whereas Poles and Americans of Polish descent and people everywhere applauded
the efforts of Solidarity's leader and now President Lech Walesa in fighting
for freedom, human rights, and economic reform in Poland;
Whereas the Polish American Congress is observing its forty-seventh anniversary
this year and is celebrating October 1991 as `Polish-American Heritage Month':
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled, That October 1991 is designated
 `Polish-American Heritage Month', and the President of the United States is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe such a month with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
