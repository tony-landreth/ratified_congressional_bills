One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating January 16, 1993, as `National Good Teen Day'.
Whereas Salem City Schools in Salem, Ohio, have proclaimed January 16, 1992,
as `Good Teen Day';
Whereas there are more than twenty-four million teenagers in the United
States according to the 1990 Census;
Whereas our Nation's teenagers represent an important part of our society,
and the many physical and emotional changes and character-building experiences
which teenagers go through are an important concern;
Whereas it is easy to stereotype teenagers as either those who have problems
or those who excel;
Whereas teenagers should not simply be recognized for their intelligence,
abilities, skills and talents, but rather for the good which is inherent in
all human beings;
Whereas as unique individuals, teenagers are encouraged to esteem the good
as well as the potential that is within each of them;
Whereas a day should be created to focus on the positive qualities in
America's youth; and
Whereas teenagers are the future of this great country: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That January 16, 1993, is designated as
  `National Good Teen Day', and the President is authorized and requested
  to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to
  observe such day by recognizing the teenagers of the United States and by
  participating in appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
