One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating March 4 through 10, 1991, as `National School Breakfast Week'.
Whereas participating in a school breakfast program is an important way
children can improve their nutrition, and good nutrition is integrally
related to learning;
Whereas, in 1988, an estimated 4,000,000 children participated in their
school breakfast programs in 38,000 schools across the country;
Whereas studies have shown that participating in school breakfast programs
improves students' academic performance and decreases their rates of tardiness
and absenteeism; and
Whereas the chief responsibility of the school food service is to assure
that children will not suffer academically because they are hungry: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That March 4 through 10, 1991, is designated
 as `National School Breakfast Week', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
