One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate October 6, 1991, and October 6, 1992, as `German-American Day'.
Whereas since the arrival of the first German immigrants to America on October
6, 1683, in the area of Germantown, Pennsylvania, German-Americans have made
significant contributions to the quality of life in the United States;
Whereas German-Americans are proud of the existing friendship and cooperation
between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States, of which the
German-American Friendship Garden in Washington, D.C., is evidence;
Whereas German-Americans pledge their unconditional support for further
expansion of the existing friendship between Germany and the United States,
and will continue to contribute to the culture of the United States, support
its Government and democratic principles, and will also work to help assure
the freedom of all people;
Whereas President Bush lauded German unification and the spirit of friendship
and cooperation between the people of the Federal Republic of Germany and the
people of the United States during proclamation ceremonies for German-American
Flag Day on October 3, 1990; and
Whereas the Congress unanimously passed joint resolutions designating October
6 of 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990 each as `German-American Day': Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 6, 1991, and October 6, 1992,
 are designated as `German-American Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States
 to observe such days with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
