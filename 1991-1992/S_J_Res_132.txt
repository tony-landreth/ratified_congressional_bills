One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of October 13, 1991, through October 19, 1991, as
`National
Radon Action Week'.
Whereas exposure to radon poses a serious threat to the health of the people
of this Nation;
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that lung cancer
attributable to radon exposure causes approximately 20,000 deaths a year in
the United States;
Whereas the United States has set a long-term national goal of making the
air inside buildings as free of radon as the ambient air;
Whereas excessively high levels of radon in homes and schools can be reduced
successfully and economically with appropriate treatment;
Whereas only about 2 percent of the homes in this Nation have been tested
for radon levels;
Whereas the people of this Nation should be educated about the dangers of
exposure to radon; and
Whereas people should be encouraged to conduct tests for radon in their homes
and schools and to make the repairs required to reduce excessive radon levels:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 13, 1991, through
 October 19, 1991, is designated as `National Radon Action Week', and the
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon
 the people of the United States to observe  that week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
