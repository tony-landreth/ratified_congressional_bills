  under this Act, the Secretary shall provide to each recipient of the

  by the Congress.
SEC. 320. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY.
  (a) FINDINGS- The Senate finds that--
  (1) the National Commission on Children report states that `The news and
  the entertainment media have tremendous potential to educate children
  and expose them to other cultures and new ideas' and recommends `that
  the recording industry continue and enhance its efforts to avoid the
  distribution of inappropriate materials to children';
  (2) the National Commission on Children report states that `In a free
  society, there will always be tension between freedom of expression and
  upholding common social values. Censorship is the antithesis of what we
  embrace. Forging common values will never depend solely on laws, but also
  on persuasion and example. Success will require thoughtful action and
  self-restraint by individuals and major institutions with the ability or
  potential to influence children's moral development. This makes the task
  of parents, public leaders, educators, media executives, entertainers,
  and advertisers more difficult, but no less important.';
  (3) the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development's executive summary of
  its publication Fateful Choices: Healthy Youth for the 21st Century states
  that, `The news and entertainment media are significant influences on the
  attitudes and behavior of young adolescents . . . . Great efforts, short
  of censorship, should be made to purge the media, particularly television
  and rock music programs, of their orgy of mindless violence . . . The news
  and entertainment media should be enlisted in efforts to promote health,
  to reduce substance abuse, violence, irresponsible sexual behavior, and
  to provide a better understanding of sound nutrition and physical exercise.';
  (4) the Massmutual American Family Values Program 1991 study states
  `Parents are challenged by the entertainment industry. While three out of
  four respondents think parents should be the primary influences on children,
  68 percent think television, movies, rock music and videos are the biggest
  influence on developing children's values. While parents understand their
  own responsibility in teaching family values, a significant number indicated
  that the entertainment media could help by providing better role models
  for both parents and children.';
  (5) in the June 1992 Journal of the American Medical Association article
  `Television and Violence', the author, Dr. Brandon S. Centerwall, states,
  `In a recent meta-analysis of randomized, case-control, short-term studies,
  exposure to media violence caused, on the average, a significant increase in
  children's aggressiveness as measured by observation of their spontaneous,
  natural behavior following exposure.'.
  (b) DECLARATIONS- The Senate--
  (1) supports the concept that corporate America and the officials of all
  American institutions can and should contribute positively to individual
  thought and conduct as key contributors to a healthy, responsible society
  and individual human dignity;
  (2) believes that corporate and institutional entities, their management and
  stockholders, as well as their advertisers and sponsors, should exercise
  positive and constructive oversight of their activities without the sole
  test of their contributions based on profits, sales, and publicity;
  (3) strongly believes that corporate America and the officials of all
  American institutions weaken the moral fiber of the Nation by hiding behind
  the faceless masks of such corporations and institutions in a relentless
  search for profits, sales and publicity without regard to the moral content
  of their products and services;
  (4) believes that the exercise of citizenship encompasses individual and
  community actions to promote responsible behavior and values; and
  (5) strongly encourages the officers, employees, and shareholders of all
  American corporations and institutions to insist upon the acceptance of
  personal responsibility for the moral flavor, content and repercussions of
  the activities, products and services of their corporations and institutions.

  emergency situation exists with respect to a decision of the Forest Service,
  implementation of the decision shall be stayed during the period beginning
  on the date of the decision--
