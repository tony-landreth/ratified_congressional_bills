One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating the month of May 1992 as `National Trauma Awareness Month'.
Whereas more than 9,000,000 individuals in the United States suffer traumatic
injury each year;
Whereas traumatic injury is the leading cause of death of individuals less
than 44 years of age in the United States;
Whereas every individual is a potential victim of traumatic injury;
Whereas traumatic injury often occurs without warning;
Whereas traumatic injury frequently renders its victims incapable of caring
for themselves;
Whereas past inattention to the causes and effects of trauma has led to the
inclusion of trauma among the most neglected medical conditions;
Whereas the people of the United States spend more than $148,500,000,000 on
the problem of trauma;
Whereas the problem of trauma can be remedied only by prevention and treatment
through emergency medical services and trauma systems; and
Whereas the people of the United States must be educated in the prevention
and treatment of trauma and in the proper and effective use of emergency
medical systems: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the month of May 1992 is designated
 as `National Trauma Awareness Month', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
