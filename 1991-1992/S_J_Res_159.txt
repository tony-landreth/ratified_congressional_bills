S.J.Res.159
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of June 1991, as `National Forest System Month'.
Whereas 1991 marks the one hundredth anniversary of the National Forest System
with the establishment of the first forest reserve in 1891, the Yellowstone
Park Timber Land Reserve;
Whereas the establishment of this first forest reserve marked a fundamental
change in United States conservation policy toward the administration of
public lands;
Whereas the purpose of the National Forest System is to conserve a portion
of America's forests for the people of the United States, recognizing the
important environmental and economic values in holding such public lands in
trust and managing them for the greatest good;
Whereas the National Forest System is one of the few examples in the world
where a public effort is being made to manage natural resources in an
economically efficient, environmentally sound, and socially responsible manner;
Whereas the National Forest System has introduced new ideas for sound resource
management, such as multiple use, sustained yield, and preservation of both
wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers; and
Whereas the one hundred and ninety-one million acres of national forests,
national grasslands, and experimental forests that now make up the National
Forest System stretch from Alaska to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
from California to Maine: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of June 1991 is designated
 as `National Forest System Month', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe such month with appropriate activities and programs.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
