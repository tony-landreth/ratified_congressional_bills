SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
  Congress finds that--
  (1) a sound and strong infrastructure is the essential core and foundation
  of the Nation's economic well-being and growth and its ability to compete
  in the global economy;
  (2) the Nation's infrastructure has been sorely neglected for years,
  and there is a desperate need at every level of government to increase
  infrastructure investment for the benefit of future generations;
  (3) it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to provide
  coordination, direction, and assistance in the restoration and maintenance of
  a sound infrastructure, including a national transportation system involving
  surface, air, and water transportation and facilities for restoration
  and preservation of water quality, prevention of damages from floods, and
  provision of hydroelectric power and municipal and industrial water supplies;
  (4) it should be a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal
  transportation system that moves people and goods in an efficient manner;
  (5) the Nation's future economic direction is dependent on its ability to
  confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining
  productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, water pollution,
  and the need to rebuild the Nation's infrastructure;
  (6) a national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible
  network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation which moves
  people and goods in the most efficient manner;
  (7) a national intermodal transportation system will enhance the ability
  of United States industry to compete in the global marketplace by reducing
  transportation costs;
  (8) all forms of transportation, including the transportation systems of the
  future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and
  air pollution while promoting economic development and productivity growth;
  (9) investment in the infrastructure of the United States will pay immediate
  and long-term dividends in jobs and economic productivity and provide the
  foundation for the Nation's continued leadership in the global economic
  competition of the 21st century;
  (10) infrastructure investment differs significantly from other forms of
  government spending because it creates new wealth for the Nation;
  (11) the wealth and economic strength of the United States is in the Nation's
  infrastructure which provides the foundation for all aspects of life;
  (12) failure to invest in the Nation's infrastructure has placed the United
  States in danger of becoming a service-oriented economy rather than having
  a strong and independent manufacturing-based economy;
  (13) foreign competitors in the global economy have surpassed the Nation's
  productivity growth through massive infrastructure investments, and
  many foreign competitors have committed to making multi-trillion dollar
  infrastructure investments in the future;
  (14) the improvement of the Nation's coastal ports is critical to its
  ability to compete in the global economy through the efficient import and
  export of goods;
  (15) the improvement of the Nation's inland waterway system is a central
  part of a national intermodal transportation system which permits the
  efficient transport of goods between markets within the Nation and between
  inland markets and coastal ports;
  (16) the prevention of massive flood damages to the Nation's cities,
  industries, cultural facilities, municipal facilities, and transportation
  system plays a vital role in the protection of the Nation's infrastructure
  and the efficient conduct of commerce;
  (17) the provision of municipal and industrial water supply plays a crucial
  role in the well-being and functioning of the Nation's communities and
  industries and in the health, environment, and quality of life of the Nation;
  (18) the generation of hydroelectric power contributes significantly to
  the Nation's supply of low-cost energy and plays a significant role in
  reducing air pollution;
  (19) the provision of recreational opportunities and the protection and
  enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and environmental values contribute
  to the well-being of the people of the Nation; and
  (20) improvement and protection of the Nation's infrastructure is an
  essential, proper, and necessary role of government at all levels.
