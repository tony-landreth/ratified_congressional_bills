Whereas basketball, the American Game, grew in popularity over the next two

and the United States defeated Canada to win the first Gold Medal;
Whereas basketball at every level of play has been enjoyed by millions
of spectators;
Whereas our youth--the future of our Nation--have become involved in various
basketball leagues that have contributed to the ideals of dedication,
commitment, and teamwork; and
