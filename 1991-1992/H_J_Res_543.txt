H.J.Res.543
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Friday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-two
Joint Resolution
Designating November 30, 1992, through December 6, 1992, as `National Education
First Week'.
Whereas the future economic success and democratic vitality of the United
States depend primarily on the Nation's ability to provide a world class
education from kindergarten through 12th grade;
Whereas all people of the United States have the right to a fulfilling,
free, and safe elementary and secondary education that will enable them to
be productive, skilled, and literate citizens;
Whereas the United States faces an unprecedented education crisis in which
students fail to graduate from high school at a rate of 3,000 students a day
(or more than 1,000,000 students a year) for the general population, and 46
percent for Black and Hispanic students;
Whereas 26,000,000 people in the United States are functionally illiterate,
and only 40 percent of the Nation's students are able to solve math problems
requiring 2 or more steps;
Whereas international competitors are outpacing the United States in preparing
their students for the 21st century, as evidenced by data indicating that
a Japanese student spends 30 percent more time in school than a student in
the United States and that Japan has a literacy rate of almost 98 percent;
Whereas the education crisis of the United States places great strains on
the Nation's economic, social, and political fabric, as evidenced by data
indicating that 80 percent of prisoners are high school dropouts, 77 percent
of college graduates (but only 37 percent of individuals with not more than
an 8th grade education) voted in the 1988 presidential election, and only
3 percent of the Nation's high school graduates can understand distinctions
among employee benefits plans;
Whereas the Nation's education crisis has reached such damaging proportions
that only a coordinated, long-term effort by all sectors of the United States,
including business, government, media, labor, and educators, can adequately
address the challenge;
Whereas the media, including the television networks, the motion picture
studios, and the cable television networks, are powerful tools to influence
and arouse the public to a better understanding of the scope and severity
of the education crisis, as well as to potential grassroots and legislative
solutions to the crisis;
Whereas the commitment of the television networks to promote `Education First
Week' represents the single greatest commitment of broadcast resources in
the history of the television medium to address a national problem; and
Whereas `Education First Week' presents a unique opportunity to mobilize
national and local political and public awareness through the media and
is a significant step in confronting the Nation's education crisis: Now,
therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
  America in Congress assembled, That November 30, 1992, through December 6,
  1992, is designated as `National Education First Week', and the President is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the
  United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
