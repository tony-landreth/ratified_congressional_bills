Joint Resolution
Designating February 21, 1993, through February 27, 1993, as `American Wine
Appreciation Week', and for other purposes.
Whereas wine was produced by our Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson,
and winegrape growing and wine production in the United States continue
today as a significant agricultural industry in 43 of the States;
Whereas the history of winegrape growing in the world dates back over 7,000
years and it continues as a proud tradition nurtured by the small farmer in
all regions of the United States;
Whereas this agricultural industry is comprised of thousands of family-owned
farms, many of which are passed on from generation to generation, sustaining
responsible preservation of our agricultural resources;
Whereas more than 1,300 wineries and over 8,000 grape and fruit growers
around the country work cooperatively to create wine;
Whereas over 85 percent of all wine consumed in the United States is produced
by United States winemakers;
Whereas the direct economic impact of the United States wine industry is
estimated to account for over $8,000,000,000 in sales annually, including
the support of over 200,000 jobs as well as $1,000,000,000 in governmental
taxes and fees;
Whereas the United States wine industry contributes to our quality of life
by its ongoing contributions to organizations and associations in the health,
civic, and educational sectors of the country;
Whereas acclaim for wine produced in the United States has grown
internationally for many years and these products account for an increasing
percentage of United States exports, helping to reduce the United States
trade deficit;
Whereas wine, consumed in moderation, enhances the appetite and provides
delicious accompaniment to all types of regional cuisine in the United States,
enriching the quality of life for the citizenry of the United States; and
Whereas wine has fulfilled a valued role in a wide variety of the cultural,
religious, and familial traditions of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That--
  (1) the Congress commends the winegrape and fruit growers and vintners
  of the United States for the production of such high quality agricultural
  products; and
