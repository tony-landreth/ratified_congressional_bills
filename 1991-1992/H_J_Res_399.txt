Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning November 1, 1992, as `National Medical Staff

Whereas there are more than 2,600 certified medical staff coordinators
across the United States whose purpose is to enhance the professionalism
and efficiency of health care in the United States;
Whereas the health care industry, especially hospital and medical staff
personnel, has experienced tremendous change and challenges in recent years;
Whereas the role of medical staff services personnel has become essential
to effective health care management;
Whereas complex legal, financial, and regulatory requirements have greatly
increased the need for expanded administration of medical staff functions;
Whereas encouraging professional development for medical staff services
personnel is essential for effective, productive, and competent hospital
and medical staffs;
Whereas, in 1978, dedicated individuals organized to recognize and support
the vitally important work of the medical staff services profession; and
Whereas a need exists to increase recognition of the valuable and important
role of the medical staff services profession across the United States: Now,
therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning November 1, 1992,
