S.J.Res.192
One Hundred Second Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety-one
Joint Resolution
Designating October 30, 1991 as `Refugee Day'.
Whereas in the past decade, the plight of refugees world wide has been
deepening as the world refugee population has more than doubled from 7,300,000
to 16,000,000;
Whereas more than 80 percent of these refugees are women and children;
Whereas one-third of the refugee population is found in Africa where the
host countries have the weakest infrastructure and are the least able to
sustain such large numbers of destitute people in flight;
Whereas the international effort to respond to the refugee crisis worldwide
with the formulation of the United Nations Convention on Refugees and the
founding of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) marks its fortieth anniversary in 1991;
Whereas the United States  has always played a leading role in refugee
matters worldwide;
Whereas the origins of the United States  as a land of refuge for those
escaping persecution and the development of the United States  as a nation
of immigrants gives the country a deep understanding of and sympathy for
the plight of the 16,000,000 refugees in the world;
Whereas refugees who have come to the United States  have made significant
contributions to the country;
Whereas the United States  has consistently encouraged other countries to
expand the effort to help the needy population of refugees and has worked
to find both short-term and long-term solutions to the refugee crisis; and
Whereas the current world refugee situation requires that the United States
continue to be a leader in refugee affairs and in the efforts to meet the
growing challenges of the refugee crisis: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) October 30, 1991 is designated as `Refugee Day'; and
 (2) the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 on the people of the United States  to observe the day with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
