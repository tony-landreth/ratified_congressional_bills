SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Senator Paul Wellstone was a tireless advocate for the 
        people of Minnesota, particularly for new immigrants and the 
        economically disadvantaged.
            (2) Paul and Sheila Wellstone loved St. Paul, Minnesota, and 
        often walked the neighborhoods of St. Paul to better understand 
        the needs of the people.
            (3) Neighborhood House was founded in the late 1800's in St. 
        Paul, Minnesota, by the women of Mount Zion Temple as a 
        settlement house to help newly arrived Eastern European Jewish 
        immigrants establish a new life and thrive in their new 
        community.
            (4) Paul and Sheila Wellstone were very committed to 
        Neighborhood House and its mission to improve the lives of its 
        residents.
            (5) When Senator Wellstone became aware that the 
        Neighborhood House Community Center was no longer adequate to 
        meet the needs of the St. Paul community, he suggested that 
        Neighborhood House request Federal funding to construct a new 
        facility.
            (6) As an honor to Paul and Sheila Wellstone, a Federal 
        grant shall be awarded to Neighborhood House to be used for the 
        design and construction of a new community center in St. Paul, 
        Minnesota, to be known as ``The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center 
        for Community Building''.
