            (2) the public health will be served by making additional 
        funds available for the purpose of augmenting the resources of 
        the Food and Drug Administration that are devoted to the process 
        for the review of devices and the assurance of device safety and 
        effectiveness so that statutorily mandated deadlines may be met; 
        and
            (3) the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated to 
        meeting the goals identified in the letters from the Secretary 
        of Health and Human Services to the Committee on Energy and 
        Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, as set

conducting inspections of establishments that manufacture, prepare, 
propagate, compound, or process class II or class III devices that are 
required in section 510(h), or inspections of such establishments 
required to register pursuant to section 510(i). The owner or operator 
of such an establishment that is eligible under paragraph (6) may, from 
the list published under paragraph (4), select an accredited person to

requesting accreditation, within 60 days after the receipt of such 
request, whether the request for accreditation is adequate for review, 
and the Secretary shall promptly act on the request for accreditation. 
Any resulting accreditation shall state that such person is accredited

(1). The accreditation of such person shall specify the particular 
activities under this subsection for which such person is accredited. In 
the first year following the publication in the Federal Register of 
criteria to accredit or deny accreditation to persons who request to 
perform the duties specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
accredit no more than 15 persons who request to perform duties specified 
in paragraph (1).

    ``(3) An accredited person shall, at a minimum, meet the following 
requirements:
            ``(A) Such person may not be an employee of the Federal

                to financial conflicts of interest.

    ``(4) <<NOTE: Publication.>> The Secretary shall publish on the

are accredited under paragraph (2). Such list shall be updated to ensure 
that the identity of each accredited person, and the particular

later than one month after the accreditation of a person under this 
subsection or the suspension or withdrawal of accreditation, or the 
modification of the particular activities for which the person is 
accredited.

    ``(5)(A) To ensure that persons accredited under this subsection 
continue to meet the standards of accreditation, the Secretary shall (i) 
audit the performance of such persons on a periodic basis through the 
review of inspection reports and inspections by persons designated by 
the Secretary to evaluate the compliance status of a device 
establishment and the performance of accredited persons, and (ii) take 
such additional measures as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.
    ``(B) The Secretary may withdraw accreditation of any person 
accredited under paragraph (2), after providing notice and an 
opportunity for an informal hearing, when such person is substantially 
not in compliance with the standards of accreditation, or poses a threat 
to public health or fails to act in a manner that is consistent with the 
purposes of this subsection. The Secretary may suspend the accreditation 
of such person during the pendency of the process under the preceding

        recent inspection of the establishment pursuant to subsection 
        (h) or (i) of section 510 as `no action indicated' or `voluntary 
        action indicated'.

                to use such a person to conduct the inspection, and the 
                Secretary provides such clearance; and

        prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by the 
        establishment, at least one of such devices is marketed in the

                the establishment submits to the Secretary a statement 
                that the law of a country in which such a device is

        not conduct the two immediately preceding inspections of the

        Secretary for a waiver of such condition. Such a waiver may be 
        granted only if the petition states a commercial reason for the 
        waiver; the Secretary determines that the public health would be 
        served by granting the waiver; and the Secretary has conducted 
        an inspection of the establishment during the four-year period 
        preceding the date on which the notice under clause (ii) is

        granted only if the petition states a commercial reason for the 
        waiver; the Secretary has not determined that the public health 
        would be served by granting the waiver; and the owner or 
        operator of the device establishment has requested in writing, 
        not later than 18 months following the most recent inspection of 
        such establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2), 
        that the Secretary inspect the establishment and the Secretary 
        has not conducted an inspection within 30 months after the most 
        recent inspection. With respect to such a waiver that is granted 
        or deemed to be granted, no additional such waiver may be 
        granted until after the Secretary has conducted an inspection of 
        the establishment.

            ``(II) In the case of an inspection to be conducted pursuant 
        to 510(i), the Secretary periodically conducts inspections of 
        the establishment.

    ``(B)(i) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The Secretary shall respond to a notice 
under subparagraph (A) from a device establishment not later than 30 
days after the Secretary receives the notice. Through such response, the 
Secretary shall (I) provide clearance under such subparagraph, and agree 
to the selection of an accredited person, or (II) make a request under 
clause (ii). If the Secretary fails to respond to the notice within such 
30-day period, the establishment is deemed to have such clearance, and 
to have the agreement of the Secretary for such selection.

    ``(ii) The request referred to in clause (i)(II) is--
            ``(I) a request to the device establishment involved to 
        submit to the Secretary compliance data in accordance with 
        clause (iii); or
            ``(II) a request to the establishment, or to the accredited 
        person identified in the notice under subparagraph (A), for 
        information concerning the relationship between the

        about the number of inspections of the establishment, or other 
        establishments owned or operated by the owner or operator of the 
        establishment, that have been conducted by the accredited 
        person.

The Secretary may make both such requests.

establishment under clause (ii) are data describing whether the quality 
controls of the establishment have been sufficient for ensuring 
consistent compliance with current good manufacturing practice within 
the meaning of section 501(h), and data otherwise describing whether the 
establishment has consistently been in compliance with sections 501 and 
502 and other applicable provisions of this Act. Such data shall include 
complete reports of inspections regarding good manufacturing practice or 
other quality control audits that, during the preceding two-year period, 
were conducted at the establishment by persons other than the owner or 
operator of the establishment, together with all other compliance data 
the Secretary deems necessary. Data under the preceding sentence shall 
demonstrate to the Secretary whether the establishment has facilitated 
consistent compliance by promptly correcting any compliance problems 
identified in such inspections.
    ``(iv) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Not later than 60 days after receiving 
compliance data under clause (iii) from a device establishment, the 
Secretary shall provide or deny clearance under subparagraph (A). The 
Secretary may deny clearance if the Secretary determines that the 
establishment has failed to demonstrate consistent compliance for 
purposes of clause (iii). The Secretary shall provide to the 
establishment a statement of such reasons for such determination. If the 
Secretary fails to provide such statement to the establishment within 
such 60-day period, the establishment is deemed to have such clearance.

    ``(v)(I) A request to an accredited person under clause (ii)(II) may 
not seek any information that is not required to be maintained by such 
person in records under subsection (f)(1). Not later than 60 days after 
receiving the information sought by the request, the Secretary shall 
agree to, or reject, the selection of such person by the device 
establishment involved. The Secretary may reject

[[Page 116 STAT. 1606]]

the selection if the Secretary provides to the establishment a statement 
of the reasons for such rejection. Reasons for the rejection may include 
that the establishment or the accredited person, as the case may be, has 
failed to fully respond to the request, or that the Secretary has 
concerns regarding the relationship between the establishment and such 
accredited person. If within such 60-day period the Secretary fails to 
agree to or reject the selection in accordance with this subclause, the 
Secretary is deemed to have agreed to the selection.
    ``(II) If the Secretary rejects the selection of an accredited 
person by a device establishment, the establishment may make an 
additional selection of an accredited person by submitting to the 
Secretary a notice that identifies the additional selection. Clauses (i) 
and (ii), and subclause (I) of this clause, apply to the selection of an 
accredited person through a notice under the preceding sentence in the 
same manner and to the same extent as such provisions apply to a 
selection of an accredited person through a notice under subparagraph 
(A).
    ``(vi) In the case of a device establishment that under clause (iv) 
is denied clearance under subparagraph (A), or whose selection of an 
accredited person is rejected under clause (v), the Secretary shall 
designate a person to review the findings of the Secretary under such 
clause if, during the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the 
establishment receives the findings, the establishment requests the 
review. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The review shall commence not later than 30 
days after the establishment requests the review, unless the Secretary 
and the establishment otherwise agree.

    ``(C)(i) In the case of a device establishment for which the 
Secretary classified the results of the most recent inspection of the 
establishment by a person accredited under paragraph (2) as `official 
action indicated', the establishment, if otherwise eligible under 
subparagraph (A), is eligible for further inspections by persons 
accredited under such paragraph if (I) the Secretary issues a written 
statement to the owner or operator of the establishment that the 
violations leading to such classification have been resolved, and (II) 
the Secretary, either upon the Secretary's own initiative or a petition 
of the owner or operator of the establishment, notifies the 
establishment that it has clearance to use an accredited person for the 
inspections. The Secretary shall respond to such petition within 30 days 
after the receipt of the petition.
    ``(ii) If the Secretary denies a petition under clause (i), the 
device establishment involved may, after the expiration of one year 
after such denial, again petition the Secretary for a determination of 
eligibility for inspection by persons accredited by the Secretary under 
paragraph (2). If the Secretary denies such petition, the Secretary 
shall provide the establishment with such reasons for such denial within 
60 days after the denial. If, as of the expiration of 48 months after 
the receipt of the first petition, the establishment has not been 
inspected by the Secretary in accordance with section 510(h), or has not 
during such period been inspected pursuant to section 510(i), as 
applicable, the establishment is eligible for further inspections by 
accredited persons.

inspections shall record in writing their inspection observations and 
shall present the observations to the device establishment's designated 
representative and describe each observation. Additionally, such 
accredited person shall prepare an inspection report

form and manner consistent with such reports prepared by employees and 
officials designated by the Secretary to conduct inspections.
    ``(B) At a minimum, an inspection report under subparagraph (A) 
shall identify the persons responsible for good manufacturing practice 
compliance at the inspected device establishment, the dates of the 
inspection, the scope of the inspection, and shall describe in detail 
each observation identified by the accredited person, identify other 
matters that relate to or may influence compliance with this Act, and 
describe any recommendations during the inspection or at the 
inspection's closing meeting.

(A) shall be sent to the Secretary and to the designated representative 
of the inspected device establishment at the same time, but under no 
circumstances later than three weeks after the last day of the 
inspection. The report to the Secretary shall be accompanied by all 
written inspection observations previously provided to the designated 
representative of the establishment.

    ``(D) Any statement or representation made by an employee or agent 
of a device establishment to a person accredited under paragraph (2) to 
conduct inspections shall be subject to section 1001 of title 18, United 
States Code.
    ``(E) If at any time during an inspection by an accredited person 
the accredited person discovers a condition that could cause or 
contribute to an unreasonable risk to the public health, the accredited 
person shall immediately notify the Secretary of the identification of 
the device establishment subject to inspection and such condition.

agreement between the accredited person and the person who engages the 
services of the accredited person, and shall be paid by the person who 
engages such services.

Secretary to inspect any device establishment pursuant to this Act.
