        additional period of employment with the agency in the territory 
        or possession, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or Commonwealth 
        of the Northern Mariana Islands, except that the total amount of

any use of an initial lump-sum payment, installment payments, or a final

    ``(3) The agreement shall describe the conditions under which the 
extended assignment incentive may be canceled prior to the

[[Page 116 STAT. 1780]]

cancellation. The agreement shall require that if, at the time of 
cancellation of the incentive, the employee has received incentive 
payments which exceed the amount which bears the same relationship to 
the total amount to be paid under the agreement as the completed service 
period bears to the agreed-upon service period, the employee shall repay 
that excess amount, at a minimum, except that an employee who is 
involuntarily reassigned to a position stationed outside the territory, 
commonwealth, or possession or involuntarily separated (not for cause on 
charges of misconduct, delinquency, or inefficiency) may not be required

employee is receiving a retention allowance under section 5754.

part of the basic pay of an employee.
    ``(f) The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations 
for the administration of this section, including regulations on an 
employee's entitlement to retain or receive incentive payments when an 
agreement is canceled. Neither this section nor implementing regulations 
may impair any agency's independent authority to administratively 
determine compensation for a class of its employees.''; and

Management, after consultation with affected agencies, shall submit a

 IMMIGRATION, JUVENILE JUSTICE, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ANTITRUST 
                                  LAWS

        TITLE I--CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CIVIL JUSTICE, AND IMMIGRATION

                    Subtitle A--General Improvements

SEC. 11001. <<NOTE: Law Enforcement Tribute Act. 42 USC 15208.>> LAW 
            ENFORCEMENT TRIBUTE ACT.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Law Enforcement 
Tribute Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The well-being of all citizens of the United States is 
        preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and 
        dedication of law enforcement and public safety personnel.
            (2) More than 700,000 law enforcement officers, both men and 
        women, at great risk to their personal safety, serve their 
        fellow citizens as guardians of peace.
            (3) Nationwide, 51 law enforcement officers were killed in 
        the line of duty in 2000, according to statistics released by 
        the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This number is an increase 
        of 9 from the 1999 total of 42.
            (4) In 1999, 112 firefighters died while on duty, an 
        increase of 21 deaths from the previous year.
            (5) Every year, 1 in 9 peace officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 
        is injured, and 1 in 4,400 is killed in the line of duty.
            (6) In addition, recent statistics indicate that 83 officers 
        were accidentally killed in the performance of their duties in 
        2000, an increase of 18 from the 65 accidental deaths in 1999.
            (7) A permanent tribute is a powerful means of honoring the 
        men and women who have served our Nation with distinction. 
        However, many law enforcement and public safety agencies lack 
        the resources to honor their fallen colleagues.

    (c) Program Authorized.--From amounts made available to carry out 
this section, the Attorney General may make grants to States, units of 
local government, and Indian tribes to carry out programs to honor, 
through permanent tributes, men and women of the United States who were 
killed or disabled while serving as law enforcement or public safety 
officers.
    (d) Uses of Funds.--Grants awarded under this section shall be 
distributed directly to the State, unit of local government, or Indian 
tribe, and shall be used for the purposes specified in subsection (c).
    (e) $150,000 Limitation.--A grant under this section may not exceed 
$150,000 to any single recipient.
    (f) Matching Funds.--
            (1) The Federal portion of the costs of a program provided 
        by a grant under this section may not exceed 50 percent.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1816]]

            (2) Any funds appropriated by Congress for the activities of 
        any agency of an Indian tribal government or the Bureau of 
        Indian Affairs performing law enforcement or public safety 
        functions on any Indian lands may be used to provide the non-
        Federal share of a matching requirement funded under this 
        subsection.

    (g) Applications.--To request a grant under this section, the chief 
executive of a State, unit of local government, or Indian tribe shall 
submit an application to the Attorney General at such time, in such 
manner, and accompanied by such information as the Attorney General may 
require.
    (h) Annual Report to Congress.--Not <<NOTE: Deadline.>> later than 
November 30 of each year, the Attorney General shall submit a report to 
the Congress regarding the activities carried out under this section. 
Each such report shall include, for the preceding fiscal year, the 
number of grants funded under this section, the amount of funds provided 
under those grants, and the activities for which those funds were used.

    (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2002 through 2006.

    (e) Amendment of the <<NOTE: 28 USC 994 note.>> Sentencing

            (1) In general.--Pursuant to its authority under section 994 
        of title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing 
        Commission shall review and amend the Federal sentencing 
        guidelines and the policy statements of the commission, if 
        appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement 
        for offenses involving influencing, assaulting, resisting, 
        impeding, retaliating against, or threatening a Federal judge, 
        magistrate judge, or any other official described in section 111

                the appropriate penalties for the offense;
                    (B) the range of conduct covered by the offense;
                    (C) the existing sentences for the offense;
                    (D) the extent to which sentencing enhancements 
                within the Federal sentencing guidelines and the 
                authority of the court to impose a sentence in excess of 
                the applicable guideline range are adequate to ensure 
                punishment at or near the maximum penalty for the most 
                egregious conduct covered by the offense;
                    (E) the extent to which the Federal sentencing 
                guideline sentences for the offense have been 
                constrained by statutory maximum penalties;
                    (F) the extent to which the Federal sentencing 
                guidelines for the offense adequately achieve the 
                purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 
                3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code;

SEC. 11009. <<NOTE: James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 
            2002. 42 USC 3796ll-3.>> JAMES GUELFF AND CHRIS McCURLEY 
            BODY ARMOR ACT OF 2002.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``James Guelff 
and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are 
        facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, 
        body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;
            (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the 
        interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;
            (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise 
        affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls 
        over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control 
        this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of 
        their police power;

[[Page 116 STAT. 1820]]

            (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco 
        Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of 
        body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, 
        California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects 
        outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris 
        McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a drug 
        dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate the 
        serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear 
        body armor during the commission of a violent crime;
            (5) of the approximately 1,500 officers killed in the line 
        of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved 
        by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times 
        higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;
            (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent 
        of State and local police are not issued body armor;
            (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local 
        police departments access to body armor that is no longer needed 
        by Federal agencies; and
            (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce 
        clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United 
        States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce 
        that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.

    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Body armor.--The term ``body armor'' means any product 
        sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as 
        personal protective body covering intended to protect against 
        gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone 
        or is sold as a complement to another product or garment.
            (2) Law enforcement agency.--The term ``law enforcement 
        agency'' means an agency of the United States, a State, or a 
        political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a 
        government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, 
        detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of 
        criminal law.
            (3) Law Enforcement Officer.--The term ``law enforcement

        prosecution of any violation of criminal law.

        Commission, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing 
        enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in section 16 
        of title 18, United States Code) or drug trafficking crime (as 
        defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code) 
        (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that 
        provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a 
        deadly or dangerous weapon or device) in which the defendant

[[Page 116 STAT. 1821]]

                of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at

                in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act), in 
                lieu of the determination under subparagraph (A)(ii), 
                the Attorney General shall determine whether the number 
                of employees of the business, as measured on any of the 
                dates described in subparagraph (D), is at no less than 
                the pre-investment level.
                    (D) Dates.--The dates described in this subparagraph 
                are the following:
                          (i) The date on which the petition described 
                      in subsection (b)(1)(C) is filed.
                          (ii) 6 months after the date described in 
                      clause (i).
                          (iii) The date on which the determination 
                      under subparagraph (A) or (C) is made.
                    (E) Removal of conditional basis if favorable 
                determination.--If the Attorney General renders an 
                affirmative determination with respect to clauses (ii) 
                and (iii) of subparagraph (A), and if the Attorney 
                General renders a negative determination with respect to 
                clause (i)

[[Page 116 STAT. 1840]]

                of such subparagraph, the Attorney General shall so 
                notify the alien involved and shall remove the 
                conditional basis of the alien's status (and that of the 
                alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under 
                section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
                U.S.C. 1186b)) effective as of the second anniversary of 
                the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence.
                    (F) Requirements relating to adverse 
                determinations.--
                          (i) Notice.--If the Attorney General renders 
                      an adverse determination with respect to clause 
                      (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A), the 
                      Attorney General shall so notify the alien 
                      involved. The notice shall be in writing and shall 
                      state the factual basis for any adverse 
                      determination. The Attorney General shall provide 
                      the alien with an opportunity to submit evidence 
                      to rebut any adverse determination. If the 
                      Attorney General reverses all adverse 
                      determinations pursuant to such rebuttal, the 
                      Attorney General shall so notify the alien 
                      involved and shall remove the conditional basis of 
                      the alien's status (and that of the alien's spouse 
                      and children if it was obtained under section 216A 
                      of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                      1186b)) effective as of the second anniversary of 
                      the alien's lawful admission for permanent 
                      residence.
                          (ii) Continuation of conditional basis if 
                      certain adverse determinations.--If the Attorney 
                      General renders an adverse determination with 
                      respect to clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph 
                      (A), and the eligible alien's rebuttal does not 
                      cause the Attorney General to reverse such 
                      determination, the Attorney General shall continue 
                      the conditional basis of the alien's permanent 
                      resident status (and that of the alien's spouse 
                      and children if it was obtained under section 216A 
                      of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                      1186b)) for a 2-year period.
                          (iii) Termination if adverse determination.--
                      If the Attorney General renders an adverse 
                      determination with respect to subparagraph (A)(i), 
                      and the eligible alien's rebuttal does not cause 
                      the Attorney General to reverse such 
                      determination, the Attorney General shall so 
                      notify the alien involved and, subject to 
                      subsection (d), shall terminate the permanent 
                      resident status of the alien (and that of the 
                      alien's spouse and children if it was obtained on 
                      a conditional basis under section 216A of the 
                      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).
                          (iv) Administrative and judicial review.--An 
                      alien may seek administrative review of an adverse 
                      determination made under subparagraph (A) by 
                      filing a petition for such review with the Board 
                      of Immigration Appeals. If the Board of 
                      Immigration Appeals denies the petition, the alien 
                      may seek judicial review. The procedures for 
                      judicial review under this clause shall be the 
                      same as the procedures for judicial review of a 
                      final order of removal under section 242(a)(1) of 
                      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1841]]

                      1252(a)(1)). During the period in which an 
                      administrative or judicial appeal under this 
                      clause is pending, the Attorney General shall 
                      continue the conditional basis of the alien's 
                      permanent resident status (and that of the alien's 
                      spouse and children if it was obtained under 
                      section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality 
                      Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b)).
            (2) Second determination.--
                    (A) Authorization to consider investments in other 
                commercial enterprises.--In determining under this 
                paragraph whether to remove a conditional basis 
                continued under paragraph (1)(F)(ii) with respect to an 
                alien, the Attorney General shall consider any capital 
                investment made by the alien in a commercial enterprise 
                (regardless of whether such enterprise is a limited 
                partnership and regardless of whether the alien entered 
                the enterprise after its formation), in the United 
                States, regardless of whether that investment was made 
                before or after the determinations under paragraph (1) 
                and regardless of whether the commercial enterprise is 
                the same as that considered in the determinations under 
                such paragraph, if facts and information with respect to 
                the investment and the enterprise are included in the 
                petition submitted under subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Petition.--In order for a conditional basis 
                continued under paragraph (1)(F)(ii) for an eligible 
                alien (and the alien's spouse and children) to be 
                removed, the alien must submit to the Attorney General, 
                during the period described in subparagraph (C), a 
                petition which requests the removal of such conditional 
                basis and which states, under penalty of perjury, the 
                facts and information described in subparagraphs (A) and 
                (B) of section 216A(d)(1) of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b(d)(1)) with respect to 
                any commercial enterprise (regardless of whether such 
                enterprise is a limited partnership and regardless of 
                whether the alien entered the enterprise after its 
                formation) which the alien desires to have considered 
                under this paragraph, regardless of whether such 
                enterprise was created before or after the 
                determinations made under paragraph (1).
                    (C) Period for filing petition.--
                          (i) 90-day period before second anniversary.--
                      Except as provided in clause (ii), the petition 
                      under subparagraph (B) must be filed during the 
                      90-day period before the second anniversary of the 
                      continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of the 
                      conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission 
                      for permanent residence.
                          (ii) Date petitions for good cause.--Such a 
                      petition may be considered if filed after such 
                      date, but only if the alien establishes to the 
                      satisfaction of the Attorney General good cause 
                      and extenuating circumstances for failure to file 
                      the petition during the period described in clause 
                      (i).
                    (D) Termination of permanent resident status for 
                failure to file petition.--

[[Page 116 STAT. 1842]]

                          (i) In general.--In the case of an alien with 
                      permanent resident status on a conditional basis 
                      under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), if no petition is 
                      filed with respect to the alien in accordance with 
                      subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall 
                      terminate the permanent resident status of the 
                      alien (and the alien's spouse and children if it 
                      was obtained on a conditional basis under section 
                      216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
                      U.S.C. 1186b)) as of the second anniversary of the 
                      continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of the 
                      conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission 
                      for permanent residence.
                          (ii) Hearing in removal proceeding.--In any 
                      removal proceeding with respect to an alien whose 
                      permanent resident status is terminated under 
                      clause (i), the burden of proof shall be on the 
                      alien to establish compliance with subparagraph 
                      (B).
                    (E) Determinations after petition.--If a petition is 
                filed by an eligible alien in accordance with 
                subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall make a 
                determination, within 90 days of the date of such 
                filing, whether--
                          (i) the petition contains any material 
                      misrepresentation in the facts and information 
                      alleged in the petition with respect to the 
                      commercial enterprises included in such petition;
                          (ii) all such enterprises, considered 
                      together, created full-time jobs for not fewer 
                      than 10 United States citizens or aliens lawfully 
                      admitted for permanent residence or other 
                      immigrants lawfully authorized to be employed in 
                      the United States (other than the eligible alien 
                      and the alien's spouse, sons, or daughters), and 
                      those jobs exist on the date on which the 
                      determination is made, except that--
                                    (I) this clause shall apply only if 
                                the Attorney General made an adverse 
                                determination with respect to the 
                                eligible alien under paragraph 
                                (1)(A)(ii);
                                    (II) the provisions of subparagraphs 
                                (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) shall apply 
                                to a determination under this clause in 
                                the same manner as they apply to a 
                                determination under paragraph 
                                (1)(A)(ii); and
                                    (III) if the Attorney General 
                                determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) 
                                that any jobs satisfying the requirement 
                                of such paragraph were created, the 
                                number of those jobs shall be subtracted 
                                from the number of jobs otherwise needed 
                                to satisfy the requirement of this 
                                clause; and
                          (iii) considering all such enterprises 
                      together, on the date on which the determination 
                      is made, the eligible alien is in substantial 
                      compliance with the capital investment requirement 
                      described in section 216A(d)(1)(B) of the 
                      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                      1186b(d)(1)(B)), except that--
                                    (I) this clause shall apply only if 
                                the Attorney General made an adverse 
                                determination with

[[Page 116 STAT. 1843]]

                                respect to the eligible alien under 
                                paragraph (1)(A)(iii); and
                                    (II) if the Attorney General 
                                determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii) 
                                that any capital amount was invested 
                                that could be credited towards 
                                compliance with the capital investment 
                                requirement described in section 
                                216A(d)(1)(B) of the Immigration and 
                                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                                1186b(d)(1)(B)), such amount shall be 
                                subtracted from the amount of capital 
                                otherwise needed to satisfy the 
                                requirement of this clause.
                    (F) Removal of conditional basis if favorable 
                determination.--If the Attorney General renders an 
                affirmative determination with respect to clauses (ii) 
                and (iii) of subparagraph (E), and if the Attorney 
                General renders a negative determination with respect to 
                clause (i) of such subparagraph, the Attorney General 
                shall so notify the alien involved and shall remove the 
                conditional basis of the alien's status (and that of the 
                alien's spouse and children if it was obtained under 
                section 216A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
                U.S.C. 1186b)) effective as of the second anniversary of 
                the continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of the 
                conditional basis of the alien's lawful admission for 
                permanent residence.
                    (G) Requirements relating to adverse 
                determinations.--
                          (i) Notice.--If the Attorney General renders 
                      an adverse determination under subparagraph (E), 
                      the Attorney General shall so notify the alien 
                      involved. The notice shall be in writing and shall 
                      state the factual basis for any adverse 
                      determination. The Attorney General shall provide 
                      the alien with an opportunity to submit evidence 
                      to rebut any adverse determination. If the 
                      Attorney General reverses all adverse 
                      determinations pursuant to such rebuttal, the 
                      Attorney General shall so notify the alien 
                      involved and shall remove the conditional basis of 
                      the alien's status (and that of the alien's spouse 
                      and children if it was obtained under section 216A

                      1186b)) effective as of the second anniversary of 
                      the continuation, under paragraph (1)(F)(ii), of 
                      the conditional basis of the alien's lawful 
                      admission for permanent residence.
                          (ii) Termination if adverse determination.--If 
                      the eligible alien's rebuttal does not cause the 
                      Attorney General to reverse each adverse 
                      determination under subparagraph (E), the Attorney 
                      General shall so notify the alien involved and, 
                      subject to subsection (d), shall terminate the 
                      permanent resident status of the alien (and that 
                      of the alien's spouse and children if it was 
                      obtained on a conditional basis under section 216A 
                      of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.

the burden of proof shall be on the Attorney General.
    (e) Clarification With Respect to Children.--In the case of an alien 
who obtained the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence on a conditional basis before the date of the enactment of 
this Act by virtue of being the child of an eligible alien described in 
subsection (b)(1), the alien shall be considered to be a child for

status after obtaining such status.

    (a) In General.--With respect to each eligible alien described in 
subsection (b), the Attorney General or the Secretary of State shall

Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(d))) the status of an alien lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis under section 
216A of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1186b). Such application shall be approved 
not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) Eligible Aliens Described.--An alien is an eligible alien 
described in this subsection if the alien--
            (1) filed, under section 204(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)) (or any predecessor 
        provision), a petition to accord the alien a status under 
        section 203(b)(5) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)) that was 
        approved by the Attorney General after January 1, 1995, and 
        before August 31, 1998;
            (2) pursuant to such approval, timely filed before the date 
        of the enactment of this Act an application for adjustment of 
        status under section 245 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) or an

        General revoked the approval of a petition described in 
        subsection (b)(1), such revocation shall be disregarded for 
        purposes of this section if it was based on a determination that 
        the alien failed to satisfy section 203(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(A)(ii)).
            (2) Applications no longer pending.--

                subsection (b)(2) is not pending on the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall 
                disregard the circumstances leading to such lack of 
                pendency and treat it as reopened, if such lack of 
                pendency is due to a determination that the alien--

[[Page 116 STAT. 1845]]

                          (i) failed to satisfy section 203(b)(5)(A)(ii)

                described in subsection (b)(2), but who is no longer 
                physically present in the United States, the Attorney 
                General shall establish a process under which the alien 
                may be paroled into the United States if necessary in 
                order to obtain adjustment of status under this section.

201(d) and 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1151(d) and 1153(b)(5)) for the fiscal year then current.

            (1) Petition.--In order for a conditional basis established

        of section 216A(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1186b(c)(1)), including the submission of a petition in

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 2002''.

SEC. 12202. FINDINGS.

    Section 101 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act 
of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5601) is amended to read as follows:

                               ``findings

    ``Sec. 101. (a) The Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Although the juvenile violent crime arrest rate in 
        1999 was the lowest in the decade, there remains a consensus 
        that the number of crimes and the rate of offending by juveniles 
        nationwide is still too high.
            ``(2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
        Delinquency Prevention, allowing 1 youth to leave school for a 
        life of crime and of drug abuse costs society $1,700,000 to 
        $2,300,000 annually.
            ``(3) One in every 6 individuals (16.2 percent) arrested for 
        committing violent crime in 1999 was less than 18 years of age. 
        In 1999, juveniles accounted for 9 percent of murder arrests, 17 
        percent of forcible rape arrests, 25 percent of robbery arrest, 
        14 percent of aggravated assault arrests, and 24 percent of 
        weapons arrests.
            ``(4) More than \1/2\ of juvenile murder victims are killed 
        with firearms. Of the nearly 1,800 murder victims less than 18 
        years of age, 17 percent of the victims less than 13 years of 
        age were murdered with a firearm, and 81 percent of the victims 
        13 years of age or older were killed with a firearm.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1870]]

            ``(5) Juveniles accounted for 13 percent of all drug abuse 
        violation arrests in 1999. Between 1990 and 1999, juvenile 
        arrests for drug abuse violations rose 132 percent.
            ``(6) Over the last 3 decades, youth gang problems have 
        increased nationwide. In the 1970's, 19 States reported youth 
        gang problems. By the late 1990's, all 50 States and the 
        District of Columbia reported gang problems. For the same 
        period, the number of cities reporting youth gang problems grew 
        843 percent, and the number of counties reporting gang problems 
        increased more than 1,000 percent.
            ``(7) According to a national crime survey of individuals 12 
        years of age or older during 1999, those 12 to 19 years old are 
        victims of violent crime at higher rates than individuals in all 
        other age groups. Only 30.8 percent of these violent

        arrested were first arrested before attaining 12 years of age. 
        Juveniles who are known to the juvenile justice system before

                their delinquent acts, and methods for increasing victim 
                satisfaction with respect to the penalties imposed on 
                juveniles for their acts.

        prevention projects that meet the needs of juveniles through the 
        collaboration of the many local service systems juveniles 
        encounter can help prevent juveniles from becoming delinquent 
        and help delinquent youth return to a productive life.

    ``(b) Congress must act now to reform this program by focusing on 
juvenile delinquency prevention programs, as well as programs that hold 
juveniles accountable for their acts and which provide opportunities for 
competency development. Without true reform, the juvenile justice system 
will not be able to overcome the challenges it will face in the coming 
years when the number of juveniles is expected to increase by 18 percent 
between 2000 and 2030.''.

            (6) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and
            (7) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:

    ``(d)(1) The court, in ordering a term of official detention, may 
include the requirement that the juvenile be placed on a term of 
juvenile delinquent supervision after official detention.
    ``(2) The term of juvenile delinquent supervision that may be 
ordered for a juvenile found to be a juvenile delinquent may not 
extend--
            ``(A) in the case of a juvenile who is less than 18 years 
        old, a term that extends beyond the date when the juvenile 
        becomes 21 years old; or
            ``(B) in the case of a juvenile who is between 18 and 21 
        years old, a term that extends beyond the maximum term of 
        official detention set forth in section 5037(c)(2) (A) and (B), 
        less the term of official detention ordered.

    ``(3) The provisions dealing with probation set forth in sections 
3563 and 3564 are applicable to an order placing a juvenile on juvenile 
delinquent supervision.
    ``(4) The court may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of 
juvenile delinquent supervision at any time prior to the expiration or 
termination of the term of supervision after a dispositional hearing and 
after consideration of the provisions of section 3563 regarding the 
initial setting of the conditions of probation.
    ``(5) If the juvenile violates a condition of juvenile delinquent 
supervision at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the 
term of supervision, the court may, after a dispositional hearing and 
after considering any pertinent policy statements promulgated by the 
Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 18, revoke the 
term of supervision and order a term of official detention. The term of 
official detention which is authorized upon revocation of juvenile 
delinquent supervision shall not exceed the term authorized in section 
5037(c)(2) (A) and (B), less any term of official detention previously 
ordered. The application of sections 5037(c)(2) (A) and (B) shall be 
determined based upon the age of the juvenile at the time of the 
disposition of the revocation proceeding. If a juvenile is over the age 
of 21 years old at the time of the revocation proceeding, the mandatory 
revocation provisions of section 3565(b) are applicable. A disposition 
of a juvenile who is over the age of 21 years old shall be in accordance 
with the provisions of section 5037(c)(2), except that in the case of a 
juvenile who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a Class A, 
B, or C felony, no term of official detention may continue beyond the 
juvenile's 26th birthday, and in any other case, no term of official 
detention may continue beyond the juvenile's 24th birthday.
    ``(6) When a term of juvenile delinquent supervision is revoked and 
the juvenile is committed to official detention, the court may include a 
requirement that the juvenile be placed on a term of juvenile delinquent 
supervision. Any term of juvenile delinquent supervision ordered 
following revocation for a juvenile who is over the age of 21 years old 
at the time of the revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with the 
provisions of section 5037(d)(1), except that in the case of a juvenile 
who if convicted as an adult

[[Page 116 STAT. 1899]]

would be convicted of a Class A, B, or C felony, no term of juvenile 
delinquent supervision may continue beyond the juvenile's 26th birthday, 
and in any other case, no term of juvenile delinquent supervision may 
continue beyond the juvenile's 24th birthday.''.
