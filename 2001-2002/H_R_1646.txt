        refugees who are particularly vulnerable or whose individual 
        circumstances otherwise suggest an urgent need for resettlement,

[[Page 116 STAT. 1375]]

        including the extent to which the Department now insists on 
        referral by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as 
        a prerequisite to consideration of such refugees for 
        resettlement in the United States, together with a plan for the 
        expanded use of alternatives to such referral, including the use 
        of field-based nongovernmental organizations to identify 
        refugees in urgent need of resettlement.
            (2) The extent to which the Department makes use in overseas 
        refugee processing of the designation of groups of refugees who 
        are of special concern to the United States, together with the 
        reasons for any decline in such use over the last 10 years and a 
        plan for making more generous use of such categories in the 
        future.
            (3) The extent to which the United States currently provides 
        opportunities for resettlement in the United States of 
        individuals who are close family members of citizens or lawful 
        residents of the United States, together with the reasons for 
        any decline in the extent of such provision over the last 10 
        years and a plan for expansion of such opportunities in the 
        future.
            (4) The extent to which opportunities for resettlement in 
        the United States are currently provided to ``urban refugees'' 
        and others who do not currently reside in refugee camps, 
        together with a plan for increasing such opportunities, 
        particularly for refugees who are in urgent need of 
        resettlement, who are members of refugee groups of special 
        interest to the United States, or who are close family members 
        of United States citizens or lawful residents.
            (5) The Department's assessment of the feasibility and 
        desirability of modifying the Department's current list of 
        refugee priorities to create an additional category for refugees 
        whose need for resettlement is based on a long period of 
        residence in a refugee camp with no immediate prospect of safe 
        and voluntary repatriation to their country of origin or last 
        permanent residence.
            (6) The extent to which the Department uses private 
        voluntary agencies to assist in the identification of refugees 
        for admission to the United States, including the Department's 
        assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of private 
        voluntary agencies, the reasons for any decline in the 
        Department's use of voluntary agencies over the last 10 years, 
        and a plan for the expanded use of such agencies.
            (7) The extent to which the per capita reception and 
        placement grant to voluntary agencies assisting in resettlement 
        of refugees has increased over the last 10 years commensurate 
        with the cost to such agencies of providing such services.
            (8) An estimate of the cost of each change in current 
        practice or procedure discussed in the report, together with an 
        estimate of any increase in the annual refugee admissions 
        ceiling that would be necessary to implement each change.

SEC. 404. PROMOTION OF SOUND FINANCIAL PRACTICES BY THE UNITED NATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the early 1980s, the United States Government began 
        to pay United States assessments to certain international 
        organizations in the last quarter of the calendar year in which 
        they were due. This practice allowed the United States to pay 
        its annual assessment to the United Nations and other

[[Page 116 STAT. 1390]]

        international organizations with the next fiscal year's 
        appropriations, taking advantage of the fact that international 
        organizations operate on calendar years. It also allowed the 
        United States to reduce budgetary outlays, making the United 
        States budget deficit appear smaller.
            (2) The United States, which is assessed 22 percent of the 
        United Nations regular budget, now pays its dues at least 10 
        months late, and often later depending on when the relevant 
        appropriation is enacted.
            (3) This practice causes the United Nations to operate 
        throughout much of the year without a significant portion of its 
        operating budget. By midyear, the budget is usually depleted, 
        forcing the United Nations to borrow from its separate 
        peacekeeping budget (the organization is prohibited from 
        external borrowing). As a result, countries that contribute to 
        United Nations peacekeeping missions are not reimbursed on a 
        timely basis.
            (4) For years, the United States has been encouraging the 
        United Nations and other international organizations to engage 
        in sound, fiscally responsible budgetary practices. In fact, 
        many of the conditions in United States law for paying nearly 
        $1,000,000,000 in debt to the United Nations and other 
        international organizations are aimed at this goal. But late 
        payment of United States dues forces the United Nations and 
        other international organizations to engage in budgetary 
        practices that are neither sound nor responsible.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should initiate a process to synchronize the payment of its 
assessments to the United Nations and other international organizations 
over a multiyear period so that the United States can resume paying its

SEC. 695. REPORT ON UNITED STATES-SPONSORED ACTIVITIES IN COLOMBIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 116 STAT. 1417]]

            (1) Heroin originating from Colombia is beginning to 
        dominate the illicit market of that narcotic in the United 
        States partly because law enforcement has struggled to interdict 
        effectively what is often voluminous importations of small 
        quantities of Colombia's inexpensive and pure heroin.
            (2) Destruction of opium, from which heroin is derived, at 
        its source in Colombia is traditionally one of the best 
        strategies to combat the heroin crisis in the United States, 
        according to Federal law enforcement officials.
            (3) There is a growing alarm concerning the spillover effect 
        of Plan Colombia on Ecuador, a frontline state. The northern 
        region of Ecuador, including the Sucumbios province, is an area 
        of particular concern.
            (4) As a result of Plan Colombia-related activities, drug 
        traffickers, guerrillas, and paramilitary groups have made 
        incursions from Colombia into Ecuador, increasing the level of 
        violence and delinquency in the border region.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Report to Congress.--Not later than 150 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a 
report to the appropriate congressional committees which sets forth a 
statement of policy and comprehensive strategy for United States 
activities in Colombia related to--
            (1) the eradication of all opium cultivation at its source 
        in Colombia; and
            (2) the impact of Plan Colombia on Ecuador and the other 
        adjacent countries to Colombia.

SEC. 696. REPORT ON EXTRADITION POLICY AND PRACTICE.

    Not later than <<NOTE: Deadline.>> May 1, 2003, the Secretary shall

extradition practice between the United States and governments of 
foreign countries with which the United States has an extradition 
relationship. The report shall include--
            (1) an aggregate list, by country, of--
                    (A) the number of extradition requests made by the 
                United States to that country in 2002; and
                    (B) the number of fugitives extradited by that 
                country to the United States in 2002;
            (2) an aggregate list, by country, of--
                    (A) the number of extradition requests made by that 
                country to the United States in 2002; and
                    (B) the number of fugitives extradited by the United 
                States to that country in 2002;
            (3) any other relevant information regarding difficulties 
        the United States has experienced in obtaining the extradition 
        of fugitives (including a discussion of the unwillingness of 
        treaty partners to extradite nationals or where fugitives may 
        face capital punishment or life imprisonment); and
            (4) a summary of the Department's efforts in 2002 to 
        negotiate new or revised extradition treaties, and its agenda 
        for such negotiations in 2003.

SEC. 697. SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE.

Court for Sierra Leone is an important step in restoring a credible

Leone and would contribute to the process of national reconciliation in 
that country.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1418]]

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should support the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Sierra

data relevant to the Commission's work.

Department of State for fiscal year 2003, there is authorized to be

        Sierra Leone'' after ``by,''; and
            (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following

Agreement Between the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone 
on the Establishment of a Special Court for Sierra Leone.''.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

[[Page 116 STAT. 1419]]

            (1) beginning in 1993, naturally occurring inorganic arsenic 
        contamination of water began to be confirmed in Bangladesh in 
        tube-wells installed in the 1970s, when standard water testing 
        did not include arsenic tests;
            (2) because health effects of ingesting arsenic-contaminated 
        drinking water appear slowly, preventative measures are critical 
        to preventing future contamination in the Bangladeshi 
        population; and
            (3) health effects of exposure to arsenic include skin 
        lesions, skin cancer, and mortality from internal cancers.

Secretary should--
            (1) work with appropriate United States Government agencies, 
        national laboratories, universities in the United States, the 
        Government of Bangladesh, international financial institutions 
        and organizations, and international donors to identify a long-
        term solution to the arsenic-contaminated drinking water problem 
        in Bangladesh, including drawing arsenic out of the existing 
        tube-wells and finding alternate sources of water; and
            (2) submit a report to the appropriate congressional 
        committees on proposals to bring about arsenic-free drinking 
        water to Bangladeshis and to facilitate treatment for those who 
        have already been affected by arsenic-contaminated drinking 
        water in Bangladesh.

                    (B) the immediate cessation of paramilitary

SEC. 705. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RETURN OF PORTRAITS OF HOLOCAUST VICTIMS 
            TO THE ARTIST DINA BABBITT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) <<NOTE: Dinah Gottliebova.>> Dina Babbitt (formerly 
        known as Dinah Gottliebova), a United States citizen has 
        requested the return of watercolor portraits she painted while 
        suffering a 1\1/2\-year-long internment at the Auschwitz death 
        camp during World War II;
            (2) Dina Babbitt was ordered to paint the portraits by the 
        infamous war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele;
            (3) Dina Babbitt's life, and her mother's life, were spared 
        only because she painted portraits of doomed inmates of 
        Auschwitz-Birkenau, under orders from Dr. Josef Mengele;
            (4) these paintings are currently in the possession of the 
        Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum;
            (5) Dina Babbitt is the rightful owner of the artwork, since 
        the paintings were produced by her own talented hands as she 
        endured the unspeakable conditions that existed at the Auschwitz 
        death camp;
            (6) the artwork is not available for the public to view at 
        the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and therefore this unique 
        and important body of work is essentially lost to history; and
            (7) this continued injustice can be righted through 
        cooperation between agencies of the United States and Poland.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the moral right of Dina Babbitt to obtain the 
        artwork she created, and recognizes her courage in the face of 
        the evils perpetrated by the Nazi command of the Auschwitz-
        Birkenau death camp, including the atrocities committed by Dr. 
        Josef Mengele;
            (2) urges the President to make all efforts necessary to 
        retrieve the 7 watercolor portraits Dina Babbitt painted, while 
        suffering a 1\1/2\-year-long internment at the Auschwitz death 
        camp, and return them to her;
            (3) urges the Secretary to make immediate diplomatic efforts 
        to facilitate the transfer of the 7 original watercolors painted 
        by Dina Babbitt from the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum to Dina 
        Babbitt, their rightful owner;
            (4) urges the Government of Poland to immediately facilitate 
        the return to Dina Babbitt of the artwork painted by her that is 
        now in the possession of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum; 
        and
            (5) urges the officials of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State 
        Museum to transfer the 7 original paintings to Dina Babbitt as 
        expeditiously as possible.

``SEC. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2349bb-2a note.>> 584. INTERNATIONAL

SEC. 1305. INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY REGULAR BUDGET ASSESSMENTS 
            AND VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department has concluded that the International 
        Atomic Energy Agency (in this section referred to as the 
        ``IAEA'') is a critical and effective instrument for verifying 
        compliance with international nuclear nonproliferation 
        agreements, and that it serves as an essential barrier to the 
        spread of nuclear weapons.
            (2) The IAEA furthers United States national security 
        objectives by helping to prevent the proliferation of nuclear 
        weapons material, especially through its work on effective 
        verification and safeguards measures.
            (3) The IAEA can also perform a critical role in monitoring 
        and verifying aspects of nuclear weapons reduction agreements 
        between nuclear weapons states.
            (4) The IAEA has adopted a multifaceted action plan, to be 
        funded by voluntary contributions, to address the threats posed 
        by radioactive sources that could be used in a radiological 
        weapon and will be the leading international agency in this 
        effort.
            (5) As the IAEA has negotiated and developed more effective 
        verification and safeguards measures, it has experienced 
        significant real growth in its mission, especially in the vital 
        area of nuclear safeguards inspections.
            (6) Nearly two decades of zero budget growth have affected 
        the ability of the IAEA to carry out its mission and to hire and 
        retain the most qualified inspectors and managers, as evidenced 
        in the decreasing proportion of such personnel who hold 
        doctorate degrees.
            (7) Increased voluntary contributions by the United States 
        will be needed if the IAEA is to increase its safeguards 
        activities and also to implement its action plan to address the 
        worldwide risks posed by lost or poorly secured radioactive 
        sources.
            (8) Although voluntary contributions by the United States 
        lessen the IAEA's budgetary constraints, they cannot readily be 
        used for the long-term capital investments or permanent staff 
        increases necessary to an effective IAEA safeguards regime.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1438]]

            (9) The recent United States decision to accept a 25 percent 
        IAEA regular budget assessment was based upon a correct 
        interpretation of existing law. It was not the intent of 
        Congress that the United States contributions to all United 
        Nations-related organizations and activities be reduced pursuant 
        to the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations 
        Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (as enacted into 
        law by section 1000(a)(7) of Public Law 106-113; 113 Stat. 
        1501A-405 et seq.), which sets 22 percent assessment rates as 
        benchmarks for the general United Nations budget, the Food and 
        Agricultural Organization, the World Health Organization, and 
        the International Labor Organization. Rather, contributions for 
        an important and effective agency such as the IAEA should be 
        maintained at levels commensurate with the criticality of its 
        mission.
            (10) The Secretary should negotiate a gradual and sustained 
        increase in the regular budget of the International Atomic 
        Energy Agency, which should begin with the 2004 budget.

    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Of the funds authorized to be 
appropriated for Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related 
Programs there is authorized to be appropriated $60,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2003 for a United States voluntary contribution to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, including for the purpose of 
implementing the Protection Against Nuclear Terrorism program adopted by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors in March 2002.

  Subtitle <<NOTE: Russian Federation Debt for Nonproliferation Act of 
2002.>> B--Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation

SEC. <<NOTE: 22 USC 5952 note.>> 1311. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Federation Debt for 
Nonproliferation Act of 2002''.

SEC. <<NOTE: 22 USC 5952 note.>> 1312. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is in the vital security interests of the United 
        States to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction to 
        additional states or to terrorist organizations, and to ensure 
        that other nations' obligations to modify their stockpiles of 
        such arms in accordance with treaties, executive agreements, or 
        political commitments are fulfilled.
            (2) In particular, it is in the vital national security 
        interests of the United States to ensure that--
                    (A) all stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable 
                nuclear material in the Russian Federation are secure 
                and accounted for;
                    (B) stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable 
                nuclear material that are excess to military needs in 
                the Russian Federation are monitored and reduced;
                    (C) any chemical or biological weapons, related 
                materials, and facilities in the Russian Federation are 
                destroyed;
                    (D) the Russian Federation's nuclear weapons complex 
                is reduced to a size appropriate to its post-Cold War 
                missions, and its experts in weapons of mass destruction 
                technologies are shifted to gainful and sustainable 
                civilian employment;
                    (E) the Russian Federation's export control system 
                blocks any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
                the means of delivering such weapons, and materials, 
                equipment, know-how, or technology that would be used to 
                develop, produce, or deliver such weapons; and
                    (F) these objectives are accomplished with 
                sufficient monitoring and transparency to provide 
                confidence that they have in fact been accomplished and 
                that the funds provided to accomplish these objectives 
                have been spent efficiently and effectively.
            (3) United States programs should be designed to accomplish 
        these vital objectives in the Russian Federation as rapidly

[[Page 116 STAT. 1443]]

        as possible, and the President should develop and present to 
        Congress a plan for doing so.
            (4) Substantial progress has been made in United States-
        Russian Federation cooperative programs to achieve these 
        objectives, but much more remains to be done to reduce the 
        urgent risks to United States national security posed by the 
        current state of the Russian Federation's weapons of mass 
        destruction stockpiles and complexes.
            (5) The threats posed by inadequate management of weapons of 
        mass destruction stockpiles and complexes in the Russian 
        Federation remain urgent. Incidents in years immediately 
        preceding 2001, which have been cited by the Russia Task Force 
        of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, include--
                    (A) a conspiracy at one of the Russian Federation's 
                largest nuclear weapons facilities to steal nearly 
                enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb;
                    (B) an attempt by an employee of the Russian 
                Federation's premier nuclear weapons facility to sell 
                nuclear weapons designs to agents of Iraq and 
                Afghanistan; and
                    (C) the theft of radioactive material from a Russian 
                Federation submarine base.
            (6) Addressing these threats to United States and world 
        security will ultimately consume billions of dollars, a burden 
        that will have to be shared by the Russian Federation, the 
        United States, and other governments, if these threats are to be 
        neutralized.
            (7) The creation of new funding streams could accelerate 
        progress in reducing these threats to United States security and 
        help the government of the Russian Federation to fulfill its 
        responsibility for secure management of its weapons stockpiles 
        and complexes as United States assistance phases out.
            (8) The Russian Federation has a significant foreign debt, a 
        substantial proportion of which it inherited from the Soviet 
        Union.
            (9) Past debt-for-environment exchanges, in which a portion 
        of a country's foreign debt is canceled in return for certain 
        environmental commitments or payments by that country, suggest 
        that a debt-for-nonproliferation exchange with the Russian 
        Federation could be designed to provide additional funding for 
        nonproliferation and arms reduction initiatives.
            (10) Most of the Russian Federation's official bilateral 
        debt is held by United States allies that are advanced 
        industrial democracies. Since the issues described pose threats 
        to United States allies as well, United States leadership that 
        results in a larger contribution from United States allies to 
        cooperative threat reduction activities will be needed.
            (11) At the June 2002 meeting of the G-8 countries, 
        agreement was achieved on a G-8 Global Partnership against the 
        Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, under which 
        the advanced industrial democracies committed to contribute 
        $20,000,000,000 to nonproliferation programs in the Russian 
        Federation during a 10-year period, with each contributing 
        country having the option to fund some or all of its 
        contribution through reduction in the Russian Federation's 
        official debt to that country.
            (12) The Russian Federation's Soviet-era official debt to 
        the United States is estimated to be $480,000,000 in Lend-

[[Page 116 STAT. 1444]]

        Lease debt and $2,250,000,000 in debt as a result of credits 
        extended under title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and 
        Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) to facilitate the accomplishment of the United States 
        objectives described in the findings set forth in subsection (a) 
        by providing for the use of a portion of the Russian 
        Federation's foreign debt to fund nonproliferation programs, 
        thus allowing the use of additional resources for these 
        purposes; and
            (2) to help ensure that the resources made available to the 
        Russian Federation are targeted to the accomplishment of the 
        United States objectives described in the findings set forth in 
        subsection (a).

    Subtitle <<NOTE: Nonproliferation Assistance Coordination Act of 
2002.>> C--Nonproliferation Assistance Coordination

SEC. <<NOTE: 50 USC 2301 note.>> 1331. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Nonproliferation Assistance 
Coordination Act of 2002''.

SEC. <<NOTE: 50 USC 2357.>> 1332. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the 
        independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved 
        important results in ensuring that weapons of mass destruction, 
        weapons-usable material and technology, and weapons-related 
        knowledge remain beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-
        proliferating states;
            (2) although these efforts are in the United States national 
        security interest, the effectiveness of these efforts has 
        suffered from a lack of coordination within and among United 
        States Government agencies;
            (3) increased spending and investment by the United States 
        private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent 
        states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and 
        investment by the United States private sector in job creation

[[Page 116 STAT. 1449]]

        initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian Federation 
        weapons scientists and technicians, are making an important 
        contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to weapons of 
        mass destruction remains beyond the reach of terrorists and 
        weapons-proliferating states; and
            (4) increased spending and investment by the United States 
        private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent 
        states of the former Soviet Union make advisable the 
        establishment of a coordinating body to ensure that United 
        States public and private efforts are not in conflict, and to 
        ensure that public spending on efforts by the independent states 
        of the former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and 
        further United States national security interests.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to--
            (1) elevate the stature given United States diplomatic 
        initiatives relating to nonproliferation and political-military 
        issues; and

[[Page 116 STAT. 1461]]

            (2) develop a group of highly specialized, technical experts 
        with country expertise capable of administering the 
        nonproliferation and political-military affairs functions of the 
        Department.

    (b) <<NOTE: Government organization.>> Authority.--To carry out the

courses administered by the Department of Defense, the Department of 
Energy, or other appropriate departments and agencies of the United 
States, except that such requirement for training may be waived by the 
Secretary.

SEC. 1605. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On April 24, 1997, the Senate provided its advice and 
        consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention 
        subject to the condition, among others, that the President 
        certify that no sample collected in the United States pursuant 
        to the Convention will be transferred for analysis to any 
        laboratory outside the territory of the United States.
            (2) Congress enacted the same condition into law as section 
        304(f)(1) of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act 
        of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6724(f)(1)).
            (3) Part II, paragraph 57, of the Verification Annex of the 
        Convention requires that all samples requiring off-site analysis 
        under the Convention shall be analyzed by at least two 
        laboratories that have been designated as capable of conducting 
        such testing by the OPCW.
            (4) The only United States laboratory currently designated 
        by the OPCW is the United States Army Edgewood Forensic Science 
        Laboratory.
            (5) In order to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
        the certification submitted pursuant to condition (18) of the 
        resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
        and the requirements of section 304(f)(1) of the Chemical 
        Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 
        6724(f)(1)), the United States must possess, at a minimum, a 
        second OPCW-designated laboratory.
            (6) The possession of a second OPCW-designated laboratory is 
        necessary in view of the potential for a challenge inspection to 
        be initiated against the United States by a foreign nation.
            (7) The possession of a third OPCW-designated laboratory 
        would enable the OPCW to implement its normal sample analysis 
        procedures, which randomly assign real and manufactured samples 
        so that no laboratory knows the origin of a given sample.
            (8) To qualify as a designated laboratory, a laboratory must 
        be certified under ISO Guide 25 or a higher standard and 
        complete three proficiency tests. The laboratory must have the 
        full capability to handle substances listed on Schedule

[[Page 116 STAT. 1462]]

        1 of the Annex on Schedules of Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention. In order to handle such substances in the United 
        States, a laboratory also must operate under a bailment 
        agreement with the United States Army.
            (9) Several existing United States commercial laboratories 
        have approved quality control systems, already possess bailment 
        agreements with the United States Army, and have the 
        capabilities necessary to obtain OPCW designation.
            (10) In order to bolster the legitimacy of United States 
        analysis of samples taken on its national territory, it is 
        preferable that one designated laboratory not be a United States 
        Government facility.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> Establishment of Non-Governmental 
Designated Laboratory.--
            (1) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2003, the United States 
        National Authority, as designated under section 101 of the 
        Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 
        U.S.C. 6711) (referred to in this section as the ``National 
        Authority''), shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
        committees a report detailing a plan for securing OPCW 
        designation of a nongovernmental United States laboratory by 
        December 1, 2004.
            (2) Directive.--Not later than June 1, 2003, the National 
        Authority shall select, through competitive procedures, a 
        nongovernmental laboratory within the United States to pursue 
        designation by the OPCW.
            (3) Delegation.--The National Authority may delegate the 
        authority and administrative responsibility for carrying out 
        paragraph (2) to one or more of the heads of the agencies 
        described in section 101(b)(2) of the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6711(b)(2)).

            (1) Chemical weapons convention or convention.--The term 
        ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' or ``Convention'' means the 
        Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production,

                Commission.
            (2) OPCW.--The term ``OPCW'' means the Organization for the 
        Prohibition of Chemical Weapons established under the
