                                 An Act


 
   To amend the Public Health Service Act <<NOTE: May 14, 2002 -  [S. 
   1094]>>  to provide for research, information, and education with 
                        respect to blood cancer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Hematological 
Cancer Research Investment and Education Act of 2002.>> 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> 

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hematological Cancer Research 
Investment and Education Act of 2002''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 42 USC 285a-10 note>> 

    Congress finds that:
            (1) An estimated 109,500 people in the United States will be 
        diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in 2001.
            (2) New cases of the blood cancers described in paragraph 
        (1) account for 8.6 percent of new cancer cases.
            (3) Those devastating blood cancers will cause the deaths of 
        an estimated 60,300 persons in the United States in 2001. Every 
        9 minutes, a person in the United States dies from leukemia, 
        lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.
            (4) While less than 5 percent of Federal funds for cancer 
        research are spent on those blood cancers, those blood cancers 
        cause 11 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States.
            (5) Increased Federal support of research into leukemia, 
        lymphoma, and multiple myeloma has resulted and will continue to 
        result in significant advances in the treatment, and ultimately 
        the cure, of those blood cancers as well as other cancers.

                    CANCER.
