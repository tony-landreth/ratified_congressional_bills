Public Law 107-89
107th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
  Amending title 36, United States Code, to designate September 11 as 
         Patriot Day. <<NOTE: Dec. 18, 2001 -  [H.J. Res. 71]>> 

Whereas on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four civilian 
    aircraft, crashing two of them into the towers of the World Trade 
    Center in New York City, and a third into the Pentagon outside 
    Washington, D.C.;

Whereas the fourth hijacked aircraft crashed in southwestern 
    Pennsylvania after passengers tried to take control of the aircraft 
    in order to prevent the hijackers from crashing the aircraft into an 
    important symbol of democracy and freedom;

Whereas these attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist attacks ever 
    launched against the United States, killing thousands of innocent 
    people; and

Whereas in the aftermath of the attacks the people of the United States 
    stood united in providing support for those in need: Now, therefore, 
    be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,
