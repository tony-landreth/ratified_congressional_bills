 To provide for the conveyance of certain public land in Clark County,

                                2937]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY TO CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Las Vegas area has experienced such rapid growth in 
        the last few years that traditional locations for target 
        shooting are now too close to populated areas for safety;
            (2) there is a need to designate a centralized location in 
        the Las Vegas Valley where target shooters can practice safely; 
        and
            (3) a central facility is also needed for persons training 
        in the use of firearms, such as local law enforcement and 
        security personnel.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to provide a suitable location for the establishment of 
        a centralized shooting facility in the Las Vegas Valley; and
            (2) to provide the public with--
                    (A) opportunities for education and recreation; and
                    (B) a location for competitive events and 
                marksmanship training.

    (c) Conveyance.--As soon as practicable after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to Clark County,

        Management Policy Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782); and
            (2) declares that those parcels are no longer subject to the 
        requirements contained in subsection (c) of that section 
        pertaining to the management of wilderness study areas in a 
        manner that does not impair the suitability of such areas for 
        preservation as wilderness.
