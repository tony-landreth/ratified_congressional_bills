    TITLE I--IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED

SEC. 101. IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED.

    Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:

   ``TITLE I--IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DISADVANTAGED

``SEC. 1001. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. <<NOTE: 20 USC 6301.>> 

    ``The purpose of this title is to ensure that all children have a 
fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality 
education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State 
academic achievement standards and state academic assessments. This 
purpose can be accomplished by--
            ``(1) ensuring that high-quality academic assessments, 
        accountability systems, teacher preparation and training, 
        curriculum, and instructional materials are aligned with 
        challenging State academic standards so that students, teachers,

[[Page 115 STAT. 1440]]

        parents, and administrators can measure progress against common 
        expectations for student academic achievement;
            ``(2) meeting the educational needs of low-achieving 
        children in our Nation's highest-poverty schools, limited 
        English proficient children, migratory children, children with 
        disabilities, Indian children, neglected or delinquent children, 
        and young children in need of reading assistance;
            ``(3) closing the achievement gap between high- and low-
        performing children, especially the achievement gaps between 
        minority and nonminority students, and between disadvantaged 
        children and their more advantaged peers;
            ``(4) holding schools, local educational agencies, and 
        States accountable for improving the academic achievement of all 
        students, and identifying and turning around low-performing 
        schools that have failed to provide a high-quality education to 
        their students, while providing alternatives to students in such 
        schools to enable the students to receive a high-quality 
        education;
            ``(5) distributing and targeting resources sufficiently to 
        make a difference to local educational agencies and schools 
        where needs are greatest;
            ``(6) improving and strengthening accountability, teaching, 
        and learning by using State assessment systems designed to 
        ensure that students are meeting challenging State academic 
        achievement and content standards and increasing achievement 
        overall, but especially for the disadvantaged;
            ``(7) providing greater decisionmaking authority and 
        flexibility to schools and teachers in exchange for greater 
        responsibility for student performance;
            ``(8) providing children an enriched and accelerated 
        educational program, including the use of schoolwide programs or 
        additional services that increase the amount and quality of

            GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 
            FISCAL YEAR 2001.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution 
        of funds under this part often does not provide funds for the 
        economically disadvantaged students for which such funds are 
        targeted.
            ``(2) Any school district in which more than 2 percent of 
        the students live below the poverty level qualifies for funding 
        under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of every 10 
        school districts in the country receive some form of aid under 
        the Formula.
            ``(3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least 
        some funding under this part, including many suburban schools 
        with predominantly well-off students.
            ``(4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor 
        students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all 
        under this part.
            ``(5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 
        1994, Congress declared that grants under this part would more 
        sharply target high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant 
        Formula, but annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of 
        that Formula.
            ``(6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other 
        funding formulas under this part is that the Targeted Grant 
        Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the 
        percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school 
        district increases.
            ``(7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's 
        family is much more likely to be associated with educational 
        disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large 
        concentrations of poor families.
            ``(8) States with large populations of high poverty students 
        would receive significantly more funding if more funds under 
        this part were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.
            ``(9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under 
        this part so that such funds will positively affect the largest 
        number of economically disadvantaged students.

    ``(b) Limitation on Allocation of Title I Funds Contingent on 
Adequate Funding of Targeted Grants.--Pursuant to section 1122, the 
total amount allocated in any fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for 
programs and activities under this part shall not exceed the amount 
allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such programs and activities unless 
the amount available for targeted grants to local educational agencies 
under section 1125 in the applicable fiscal year meets the requirements 
of section 1122(a).

the amount of a grant a local educational agency would receive under 
sections 1124, 1124A, 1125, and 1125A is more than such local 
educational agency will use, the State educational agency shall make the 
excess amount available to other local educational agencies in the State

or, in the discretion of the Secretary, that the State educational 
agency shall not make further payments under this subpart to specified

        educational agency within such State, relative to the total

        State would otherwise have received had such determination been 
        made on the basis of accurate data.

    Title V (20 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:

  ``TITLE V--PROMOTING INFORMED PARENTAL CHOICE AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

                      ``PART A--INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS

``SEC. 5101. <<NOTE: 20 USC 7201.>>  PURPOSES, STATE AND LOCAL 
            RESPONSIBILITY.

    ``(a) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are the following:
            ``(1) To support local education reform efforts that are 
        consistent with and support statewide education reform efforts.

[[Page 115 STAT. 1777]]

            ``(2) To provide funding to enable State educational 
        agencies and local educational agencies to implement promising 
        educational reform programs and school improvement programs 
        based on scientifically based research.
            ``(3) To provide a continuing source of innovation and 
        educational improvement, including support programs to provide 
        library services and instructional and media materials.
            ``(4) To meet the educational needs of all students, 
        including at-risk youth.
            ``(5) To develop and implement education programs to improve 
        school, student, and teacher performance, including professional 
        development activities and class size reduction programs.

    ``(b) State and Local Responsibility.--The State educational agency 
shall bear the basic responsibility for the administration of funds made 
available under this part, but it is the intent of Congress that the 
responsibility be carried out with a minimum of paperwork and that the 
responsibility for the design and implementation of programs assisted 
under this part be mainly that of local educational agencies, school 
superintendents and principals, and classroom teachers and supporting 
personnel, because local educational agencies and individuals have the 
most direct contact with students and are most likely to be able to 
design programs to meet the educational needs of students in their own 
school districts.

            ``(2) The use of magnet schools has increased dramatically 
        since the inception of the magnet schools assistance program 
        under this Act, with approximately 2,000,000 students nationwide 
        attending such schools, of whom more than 65 percent are non-

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians have been linked 
        for over 200 years to the coastal towns of Salem, Massachusetts, 
        and New Bedford, Massachusetts, through the China trade from 
        Salem and whaling voyages from New Bedford.
            ``(2) Nineteenth-century trading ships sailed from Salem, 
        Massachusetts, around Cape Horn of South America, and up the 
        Northwest coast of the United States to Alaska, where their 
        crews traded with Alaska Native people for furs, and then went 
        on to Hawaii to trade for sandalwood with Native Hawaiians 
        before going on to China.
            ``(3) During the 19th century, over 2,000 whaling voyages 
        sailed out of New Bedford, Massachusetts to the Arctic region of 
        Alaska, and joined Alaska Natives from Barrow, Alaska and other 
        areas in the Arctic region in subsistence whaling activities.
            ``(4) Many New Bedford whaling voyages continued on to 
        Hawaii, where they joined Native Hawaiians from the neighboring

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous 
        people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants 
        of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a 
        nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United 
        States, Britain, France, and Japan, as evidenced by treaties 
        governing friendship, commerce, and navigation.
            ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous 
        people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a 
        highly organized, self-sufficient subsistence social system 
        based on a communal land tenure system with a sophisticated 
        language, culture, and religion.
            ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian Islands 
        was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of 
        Hawaii.
            ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the 
        sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which was 
        established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended full and 
        complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and 
        entered into treaties and conventions with the Kingdom of Hawaii 
        to govern friendship, commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 
        1849, 1875, and 1887.

            ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally 
        recognized, and indigenous government of Hawaii, the Kingdom of 
        Hawaii, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, 
        including United States citizens, who were assisted in their 
        efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval 
        representative, and armed naval forces of the United States. 
        Because of the participation of United States agents and 
        citizens in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1993 the 
        United States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow 
        and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-
        determination through Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510).
            ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint 
        Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the 
        United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), ceded 
        absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of Hawaii, 
        including the government and crown lands of the former Kingdom 
        of Hawaii, to the United States, but mandated that revenue 
        generated from the lands be used `solely for the benefit of the 
        inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for educational and other 
        public purposes'.
            ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined 
        from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, and 
        in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted the 
        Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which 
        designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands for 
        homesteading by Native Hawaiians.
            ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission 
        Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special relationship between 
        the United States and the Native Hawaiians, which was described 
        by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: 
        `One thing that impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives 
        of the island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a 
        sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and 
        many of them are in poverty.'.
            ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique status 
        of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 
        (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, 392b, 392c, 
        396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the National Parks 
        extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area 
        `only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent 
        villages and by visitors under their guidance.'.
            ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the 
        admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', approved March 
        18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred 
        responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands 
        to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship 
        between the United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining 
        the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to 
        approve land exchanges and amendments to such Act affecting the 
        rights of beneficiaries under such Act.
            ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide 
        for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union', the 
        United States also ceded to the State of Hawaii title to the 
        public lands formerly held by the United States, but mandated 
        that such lands be held by the State `in public trust' and

[[Page 115 STAT. 1934]]

        reaffirmed the special relationship that existed between the 
        United States and the Hawaiian people by retaining the legal 
        responsibility to enforce the public trust responsibility of the 
        State of Hawaii for the betterment of the conditions of Native 
        Hawaiians, as defined in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes 
        Commission Act, 1920.
            ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed 
        that--
                    ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, 
                and land-based link to the indigenous people who 
                exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and 
                that group has never relinquished its claims to 
                sovereignty or its sovereign lands;
                    ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native 
                Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their 
                unique status as the indigenous people of a once 
                sovereign nation as to whom the United States has 
                established a trust relationship;

            ``(13) The political relationship between the United States

        to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native Hawaiian 
        education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian Educational 
        Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and

[[Page 115 STAT. 1935]]

        documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with regard 
        to national norms on standardized achievement tests, were 
        disproportionately represented in many negative social and 
        physical statistics indicative of special educational needs, and 
        had educational needs that were related to their unique cultural 
        situation, such as different learning styles and low self-image.
            ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native 
        Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus F. 
        Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School 
        Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize and 
        develop supplemental educational programs to address the unique 
        conditions of Native Hawaiians.

        released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian 
        Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the 
        successes of the programs established under title IV of the 
        Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary 
        School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same 
        educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. Subsequent 
        reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate and other

        Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of

        rank among the lowest groups of students nationally in reading, 
        and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest among Hawaiian 
        students in reading, it is imperative that greater focus be 
        placed on beginning reading and early education and literacy in 
        Hawaii.

        are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and integration 
        of traditional culture and Western education historically 
        achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian language-based 
        public school system established in 1840 by Kamehameha III.

        1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned. After annexation, 
        throughout the territorial and statehood period of Hawaii, and 
        until 1986, use of the Hawaiian language as an instructional 
        medium in education in public schools was declared unlawful. The 
        declaration caused incalculable harm to a culture that placed a 
        very high value on the power of language, as exemplified in the 
        traditional saying: `I ka `olelo no ke ola; I ka `olelo no ka 
        make. In the language rests life; In the language rests death.'.

        generations their ancestral territory and their cultural 
        identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional 
        beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.

Act.>>  C--ALASKA NATIVE EDUCATION

``SEC. 7301. <<NOTE: 20 USC 7541.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Alaska Native Educational Equity, 
Support, and Assistance Act'.

``SEC. 7302. <<NOTE: 20 USC 7542.>>  FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds and declares the following:

[[Page 115 STAT. 1943]]

            ``(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to 
        the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being, and 
        preservation of the culture of Alaska Natives.
            ``(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to 
        encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the 
        planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs.
            ``(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with 
        serious educational handicaps.
            ``(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children 
        is far below national norms. Native performance on standardized 
        tests is low, Native student dropout rates are high, and Natives 
        are significantly underrepresented among holders of 
        baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a result, 
        Native students are being denied their opportunity to become 
        full participants in society by grade school and high school 
        educations that are condemning an entire generation to an 
        underclass status and a life of limited choices.
            ``(5) The programs authorized in this part, combined with 
        expanded Head Start, infant learning, and early childhood 
        education programs, and parent education programs, are essential 
        if educational handicaps are to be overcome.
            ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be 
        overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska and 
        Alaska villages should be addressed through the development and 
        implementation of innovative, model programs in a variety of 
        areas.
            ``(7) Native children should be afforded the opportunity to 
        begin their formal education on a par with their non-Native 
        peers. The Federal Government should lend support to efforts 
        developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community 
        to improve educational opportunity for all students.

``SEC. 7303. <<NOTE: 20 USC 7543.>>  PURPOSES.

    ``The purposes of this part are as follows:
            ``(1) To recognize the unique educational needs of Alaska 
        Natives.

        educational programs to benefit Alaska Natives.
            ``(3) To supplement existing programs and authorities in the 
        area of education to further the purposes of this part.
            ``(4) To provide direction and guidance to appropriate 
        Federal, State and local agencies to focus resources, including 
        resources made available under this part, on meeting the 
        educational needs of Alaska Natives.

SEC. 1032. EDUCATION FOR HOMELESS CHILDREN AND YOUTHS.

    Subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance 
Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:

        ``Subtitle B--Education for Homeless Children and Youths

``SEC. 721. <<NOTE: 42 USC 11431.>>  STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    ``The following is the policy of the Congress:
            ``(1) Each State educational agency shall ensure that each 
        child of a homeless individual and each homeless youth has equal 
        access to the same free, appropriate public education, including 
        a public preschool education, as provided to other children and 
        youths.
            ``(2) In any State that has a compulsory residency 
        requirement as a component of the State's compulsory school 
        attendance laws or other laws, regulations, practices, or 
        policies that may act as a barrier to the enrollment, 
        attendance, or success in school of homeless children and 
        youths, the State will review and undertake steps to revise such 
        laws, regulations, practices,

[[Page 115 STAT. 1990]]

        or policies to ensure that homeless children and youths are 
        afforded the same free, appropriate public education as provided 
        to other children and youths.
            ``(3) Homelessness alone is not sufficient reason to 
        separate students from the mainstream school environment.
            ``(4) Homeless children and youths should have access to the 
        education and other services that such children and youths need 
        to ensure that such children and youths have an opportunity to 
        meet the same challenging State student academic achievement 
        standards to which all students are held.

following new sections:

``SEC. 5202. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2501.>>  DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    ``(a) Recognition.--Congress recognizes that the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act, which was a product of the 
legitimate aspirations and a recognition of the inherent authority of 
Indian nations, was and is a crucial positive step toward tribal and 
community control and that the United States has an obligation to assure 
maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational services so 
as to render the persons administering such services and the services 
themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of Indian 
communities.
    ``(b) Commitment.--Congress declares its commitment to the 
maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing trust 
relationship with and responsibility to the Indian people for the 
education of Indian children through the establishment of a meaningful 
Indian self-determination policy for education that will deter further 
perpetuation of Federal bureaucratic domination of programs.
    ``(c) National Goal.--Congress declares that a national goal of the 
United States is to provide the resources, processes, and structure that 
will enable tribes and local communities to obtain the quantity and 
quality of educational services and opportunities that will permit 
Indian children--
            ``(1) to compete and excel in areas of their choice; and
            ``(2) to achieve the measure of self-determination essential 
        to their social and economic well-being.

    ``(d) Educational Needs.--Congress affirms--
            ``(1) true self-determination in any society of people is 
        dependent upon an educational process that will ensure the 
        development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership 
        roles;
            ``(2) that Indian people have special and unique educational 
        needs, including the need for programs to meet the linguistic 
        and cultural aspirations of Indian tribes and communities; and

[[Page 115 STAT. 2064]]

            ``(3) that those needs may best be met through a grant 
        process.

    ``(e) Federal Relations.--Congress declares a commitment to the 
policies described in this section and support, to the full extent of 
congressional responsibility, for Federal relations with the Indian 
nations.
    ``(f) Termination.--Congress repudiates and rejects House Concurrent 
Resolution 108 of the 83d Congress and any policy of unilateral 
termination of Federal relations with any Indian nation.
