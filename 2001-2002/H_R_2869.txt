                into consideration the ability of the person to pay

                settlement, the President shall consider such 
                alternative payment methods as may be necessary or 
                appropriate.

                party waive all of the claims (including a claim for 
                contribution under this Act) that the party may have 
                against other potentially responsible parties for 
                response costs incurred with respect to the facility, 
                unless the President determines that requiring a waiver 
                would be unjust.

                administrative subpoena issued by the President under

        President determines that a potentially responsible party is not 
        eligible for settlement under this subsection, the President 
        shall provide the reasons for the determination in writing to 
        the potentially responsible party that requested a settlement 
        under this subsection.
            ``(10) <<NOTE: President.>>  Notification.--As soon as 
        practicable after receipt of sufficient information to make a 
        determination, the President shall notify any person that the 
        President determines is eligible under paragraph (1) of the 
        person's eligibility for an expedited settlement.
            ``(11) No judicial review.--A determination by the President 
        under paragraph (7), (8), (9), or (10) shall not be subject to
