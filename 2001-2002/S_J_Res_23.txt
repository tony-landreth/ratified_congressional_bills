                            Joint Resolution


 
    To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those 
     responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United 
           States. <<NOTE: Sept. 18, 2001 -  [S.J. Res. 23]>> 

Whereas, on September 11, 2001, acts of treacherous violence were 
    committed against the United States and its citizens; and
Whereas, such acts render it both necessary and appropriate that the 
    United States exercise its rights to self-defense and to protect 
    United States citizens both at home and abroad; and
Whereas, in light of the threat to the national security and foreign 
    policy of the United States posed by these grave acts of violence; 
    and
Whereas, such acts continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
    to the national security and foreign policy of the United States; 
    and
Whereas, the President has authority under the Constitution to take 
    action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against 
    the United States: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Authorization for Use
