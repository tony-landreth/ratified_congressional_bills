Interstate School Compact which have been agreed to by such States that 
is substantially as follows: Article VII D of such compact is amended to 
read as follows:
    ``D. Authorization Proceedings.--An interstate district shall 
authorize the incurring of debts to finance capital projects by a 
majority vote of the district passed at an annual or special district 
meeting. Such vote shall be taken by secret ballot after full 
opportunity for debate, and any such vote shall be subject to 
reconsideration and further action by the district at the same meeting 
or at an adjourned session thereof. As an alternative, an interstate 
district may provide in its articles of agreement that such a vote be 
conducted by Australian or official balloting under procedures as set 
forth in the articles of agreement, and that such vote be subject to any 
method of reconsideration, if any, which the interstate district sets 
forth in the articles of agreement.''.
