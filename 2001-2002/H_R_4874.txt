            (1) The meander lines in the original surveys by John B. 
        David, deputy surveyor, of two lakes in the State of Idaho, 
        Spirit Lake, formerly known as Lake Tesemini, located in T. 53 
        N., R. 4 W., Boise Meridian, and Twin Lakes, formerly known as 
        Fish Lake, located in T. 52 N. and T. 53 N., R. 4 W., Boise 
        Meridian, do not reflect the current line of ordinary high water 
        conditions.
            (2) All lands adjacent to the original meander lines have 
        been patented.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the Secretary of 
the Interior to issue a recordable disclaimer of interest by the United 
States to any omitted lands or lands lying outside the record meander 
lines in the vicinity of the lakes referred to in subsection (a).
