title as of the beginning date of the enrollment period for the program 
of education for which the accelerated payment is made.

paragraph (1), for the periods covered by the initial rate and increased 
rate, respectively, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary.

            EXPANSION OF THE COURT.

    (a) In General.--Section 7253 is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(h) Temporary Expansion of Court.--(1) During the period from

judges of the Court specified in subsection (a) is increased by two.
    ``(2)(A) Of the two additional judges authorized by this 
subsection--
            ``(i) only one may be appointed pursuant to a nomination 
        made in 2002; and
            ``(ii) only one may be appointed pursuant to a nomination 
        made in 2003.

    ``(B) If a judge is not appointed under this subsection pursuant to 
a nomination made in 2002, a judge may be appointed under this 
subsection pursuant to a nomination made in 2004. If a judge is not 
appointed under this subsection pursuant to a nomination made in 2003, a 
judge may be appointed under this subsection pursuant to a nomination 
made in 2004. In either case, such an appointment may be made only 
pursuant to a nomination made before October 1, 2004.
    ``(3) The term of office and the eligibility for retirement of a 
judge appointed under this subsection, other than a judge described in 
paragraph (4), are governed by the provisions of section 1012 of the 
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Amendments of 1999 (title X of 
Public Law 106-117; 113 Stat. 1590; 38 U.S.C. 7296 note) if the judge is

    ``(4) A judge of the Court as of the date of the enactment of this 
subsection who was appointed to the Court before January 1, 1991, may 
accept appointment as a judge of the Court under this subsection 
notwithstanding that the term of office of the judge on the Court has 
not yet expired under this section. The term of office of an incumbent 
judge who receives an appointment as described in the preceding sentence 
shall be 15 years, which includes any period remaining in the unexpired 
term of the judge. Any service following an appointment under this 
subsection shall be treated as though served as part of the original 
term of office of that judge on the Court.
    ``(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an appointment may not be made 
to the Court if the appointment would result in there being more than 
seven judges on the Court who were appointed after January 1, 1997. For 
the purposes of this paragraph, a judge serving in recall status under 
section 7257 of this title shall be disregarded in counting the number 
of judges appointed to the Court after such date.''.
