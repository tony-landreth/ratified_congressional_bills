                      primary tumor, means a primary tumor that is

                      the World Health Organization, in collaboration 
                      with international centers, to promote 
                      international comparability in the collection, 
                      classification, processing, and presentation of 
                      cancer statistics. The ICD-O system is a

                      Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
                      Problems (commonly known as the ICD) and is the

                      system referred to in the first sentence of this 
                      clause.

received such a grant for fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services may delay the applicability of such amendments to the 
State for not more than 12 months if the Secretary determines that 
compliance with such amendments requires the enactment of a statute by 
the State or the issuance of State regulations.
