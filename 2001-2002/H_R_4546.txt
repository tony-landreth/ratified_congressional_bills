                    (E) reinvigorated efforts to defend America against 
                ballistic missiles by supporting an increase in fiscal

        timeliness of access to such services and patient safety.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The aircraft carrier has been an integral component in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom and in the homeland defense mission 
        of Operation Noble Eagle beginning on September 11, 2001. The 
        aircraft carriers that have participated in Operation Enduring 
        Freedom, as of May 1, 2002, are the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the 
        USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70), the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), the USS 
        Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), the USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74), 
        and the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67). The aircraft carriers that 
        have participated in Operation Noble Eagle, as of May 1, 2002, 
        are the USS George Washington (CVN-73), the USS John F. Kennedy 
        (CV-67), and the USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74).
            (2) Since 1945, the United States has built 172 bases 
        overseas, of which only 24 are currently in use.
            (3) The aircraft carrier provides an independent base of 
        operations should no land base be available for aircraft, with 
        carrier air wings providing the United States sea-based forward-
        deployed offensive strike capability.
            (4) The aircraft carrier is an essential component of the 
        Navy.
            (5) The naval tactical aircraft modernization programs are 
        proceeding on schedule.
            (6) As established by the Navy, the United States requires 
        the service of 15 aircraft carriers to completely fulfill all 
        the naval commitments assigned to the Navy without gapping 
        carrier presence.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the number 
of aircraft carriers of the Navy in active service should not be less 
than 12.
    (c) Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Noble Eagle 
Commendation.--Congress hereby commends the military and civilian 
personnel who have participated in Operation Enduring Freedom and 
Operation Noble Eagle.

 Subtitle E--Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium at Savannah River, 
                             South Carolina

SEC. 3181. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In September 2000, the United States and the Russian 
        Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition 
        Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34 metric tons of 
        weapons-grade plutonium.
            (2) The agreement with Russia is a significant step toward 
        safeguarding nuclear materials and preventing their diversion to 
        rogue states and terrorists.
            (3) The Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 metric 
        tons of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States before the 
        end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mixed-oxide fuel to 
        be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.
            (4) The Department has formulated a plan for implementing 
        the agreement with Russia through construction of a mixed-oxide 
        fuel fabrication facility, the so-called MOX facility, and a pit 
        disassembly and conversion facility at the Savannah River Site, 
        Aiken, South Carolina.
            (5) The United States and the State of South Carolina have a 
        compelling interest in the safe, proper, and efficient operation 
        of the plutonium disposition facilities at the Savannah River 
        Site. The MOX facility will also be economically beneficial to 
        the State of South Carolina, and that economic benefit will not 
        be fully realized unless the MOX facility is built.
            (6) The State of South Carolina desires to ensure that all 
        plutonium transferred to the State of South Carolina is stored 
        safely; that the full benefits of the MOX facility are realized 
        as soon as possible; and, specifically, that all defense 
        plutonium or defense plutonium materials transferred to the 
        Savannah River Site either be processed or be removed 
        expeditiously.

SEC. 3182. DISPOSITION OF WEAPONS-USABLE PLUTONIUM AT SAVANNAH RIVER 
            SITE.
