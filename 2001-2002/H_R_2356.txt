1971 (2 U.S.C. 434), as amended by section 103, is amended by adding at 
the end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) Disclosure of Electioneering Communications.--
            ``(1) Statement required.--Every person who makes a 
        disbursement for the direct costs of producing and airing

                subparagraph is to be construed as a prohibition on the 
                use of funds in such a segregated account for a purpose 
                other than electioneering communications.
                    ``(F) If the disbursements were paid out of funds

        sentencing under section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States 
        Code.
