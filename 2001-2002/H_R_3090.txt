written notice to the Secretary, terminate such agreement.
    (b) Provisions of Agreement.--Any agreement under subsection (a) 
shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of 
temporary extended unemployment compensation to individuals who--
            (1) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under 
        the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit 
        year (excluding any benefit year that ended before March 15, 
        2001);

[[Page 116 STAT. 27]]

            (2) have no rights to regular compensation or extended 
        compensation with respect to a week under such law or any other 
        State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any

            (3) are not receiving compensation with respect to such week 
        under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and

        after March 15, 2001.

    (c) Exhaustion of Benefits.--For purposes of subsection (b)(1), an 
individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual's rights to 
regular compensation under a State law when--
            (1) no payments of regular compensation can be made under 
        such law because such individual has received all regular 
        compensation available to such individual based on employment or 
        wages during such individual's base period; or
            (2) such individual's rights to such compensation have been 
        terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with 
        respect to which such rights existed.

    (d) Weekly Benefit Amount, Etc.--For purposes of any agreement under 
this title--
            (1) the amount of temporary extended unemployment 
        compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any 
        week of total unemployment shall be equal to the amount of the 
        regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable 
        to such individual during such individual's benefit year under 
        the State law for a week of total unemployment;
            (2) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to 
        claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall 
        apply to claims for temporary extended unemployment compensation 
        and the payment thereof, except--
                    (A) that an individual shall not be eligible for 
                temporary extended unemployment compensation under this 
                title unless, in the base period with respect to which 
                the individual exhausted all rights to regular 
                compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 
                weeks of full-time insured employment or the equivalent 
                in insured wages, as determined under the provisions of 
                the State law implementing section 202(a)(5) of the 
                Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 
                1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note); and
                    (B) where otherwise inconsistent with the provisions 
                of this title or with the regulations or operating 
                instructions of the Secretary promulgated to carry out 
                this title; and
            (3) the maximum amount of temporary extended unemployment 
        compensation payable to any individual for whom a temporary 
        extended unemployment compensation account is established under 
        section 203 shall not exceed the amount established in such 
        account for such individual.

    (e) Election by States.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
Federal law (and if State law permits), the Governor of a State that is 
in an extended benefit period may provide for the payment of temporary 
extended unemployment compensation in lieu of extended compensation to 
individuals who otherwise meet the requirements of this section. Such an 
election shall not require a State to trigger off an extended benefit 
period.

SEC. 203. TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT.

    (a) In General.--Any agreement under this title shall provide that 
the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an 
application for temporary extended unemployment compensation, a 
temporary extended unemployment compensation account with respect to 
such individual's benefit year.
    (b) Amount in Account.--
            (1) In general.--The amount established in an account under 
        subsection (a) shall be equal to the lesser of--
                    (A) 50 percent of the total amount of regular 
                compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable 
                to the individual during the individual's benefit year 
                under such law, or
                    (B) 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit 
                amount for the benefit year.
            (2) Weekly benefit amount.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        an individual's weekly benefit amount for any week is the amount 
        of regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) under 
        the State law payable to such individual for such week for total 
        unemployment.

    (c) Special Rule.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        section, if, at the time that the individual's account is 
        exhausted, such individual's State is in an extended benefit 
        period (as determined under paragraph (2)), then, such account 
        shall be augmented by an amount equal to the amount originally 
        established in such account (as determined under subsection 
        (b)(1)).
            (2) Extended benefit period.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
        a State shall be considered to be in an extended benefit period 
        if, at the time of exhaustion (as described in paragraph (1))--
                    (A) such a period is then in effect for such State 
                under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment 
                Compensation Act of 1970; or
                    (B) such a period would then be in effect for such 
                State under such Act if section 203(d) of such Act were 
                applied as if it had been amended by striking ``5'' each 
                place it appears and inserting ``4''.

            TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.

percent of the temporary extended unemployment compensation paid to 
individuals by the State pursuant to such agreement.
    (b) Treatment of Reimbursable Compensation.--No payment shall be 
made to any State under this section in respect of any compensation to

entitled to any reimbursement under such chapter 85 in respect of any 
compensation to the extent the State is entitled to reimbursement under 
this title in respect of such compensation.

[[Page 116 STAT. 29]]

    (c) Determination of Amount.--Sums payable to any State by reason of 
such State having an agreement under this title shall be payable, either 
in advance or by way of reimbursement (as may be determined by the 
Secretary), in such amounts as the Secretary estimates the State will be 
entitled to receive under this title for each calendar month, reduced or 
increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the Secretary 
finds that the Secretary's estimates for any prior calendar month were 
greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the 
State. Such estimates may be made on the basis of such statistical, 
sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the 
State agency of the State involved.

SEC. 205. FINANCING PROVISIONS.

making of payments to States having agreements entered into under this 
title.
    (b) Certification.--The Secretary shall from time to time certify to 
the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable

        States Code; and
            (2) compensation payable on the basis of services to which

SEC. 206. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS.

    (a) In General.--If an individual knowingly has made, or caused to 
be made by another, a false statement or representation of a material 
fact, or knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a 
material fact, and as a result of such false statement or representation 
or of such nondisclosure such individual has received an amount of 
temporary extended unemployment compensation under this title to which 
he was not entitled, such individual--

[[Page 116 STAT. 30]]

            (1) shall be ineligible for further temporary extended 
        unemployment compensation under this title in accordance with

of temporary extended unemployment compensation under this title to 
which they were not entitled, the State shall require such individuals 
to repay the amounts of such temporary extended unemployment 
compensation to the State agency, except that the State agency may waive 
such repayment if it determines that--
            (1) the payment of such temporary extended unemployment 
        compensation was without fault on the part of any such 
        individual; and
            (2) such repayment would be contrary to equity and good 
        conscience.

    (c) Recovery by State Agency.--
            (1) In general.--The State agency may recover the amount to 
        be repaid, or any part thereof, by deductions from any temporary 
        extended unemployment compensation payable to such individual 
        under this title or from any unemployment compensation payable 
        to such individual under any Federal unemployment compensation 
        law administered by the State agency or under any other Federal 
        law administered by the State agency which provides for the 
        payment of any assistance or allowance with respect to any week 
        of unemployment, during the 3-year period after the date such 
        individuals received the payment of the temporary extended 
        unemployment compensation to which they were not entitled,
