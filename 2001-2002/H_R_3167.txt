   To endorse the vision of further enlargement of the NATO Alliance 
articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, 2001, and by former 
    President William J. Clinton on October 22, 1996, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: June 10, 2002 -  [H.R. 3167]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Gerald B. H. Solomon 
Freedom Consolidation Act of 2002.>> assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 22 USC 1928 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom 
Consolidation Act of 2002''.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 22 USC 1928 note.>> FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of 
        Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared that 
        ``full and active participants in the Partnership for Peace in a 
        position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area 
        should be invited to become full NATO members in accordance with 
        Article 10 of such Treaty at an early date . . .''.
            (2) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title 
        VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law 104-
        208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt 
        admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia 
        to NATO, and declared that ``in order to promote economic 
        stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
        Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine . . . the 
        process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in 
        Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to 
        consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
        and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance''.
            (3) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of 
        division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress 
        declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should 
        not be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern 
        Europe invited to join NATO'' and that ``Romania, Estonia, 
        Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria . . . would make an outstanding 
        contribution to furthering the goals of NATO and enhancing 
        stability, freedom, and peace in Europe should they become NATO 
        members [and] upon complete satisfaction of all relevant 
        criteria should be invited to become full NATO members at the 
        earliest possible date''.
            (4) At the Madrid Summit of the NATO Alliance in July 1997, 
        Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join the 
        Alliance in the first round of NATO enlargement,

[[Page 116 STAT. 591]]

        and the NATO heads of state and government issued a declaration 
        stating ``[t]he Alliance expects to extend further invitations 
        in coming years to nations willing and able to assume the 
        responsibilities and obligations of membership . . . [n]o 
        European democratic country whose admission would fulfill the 
        objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from 
        consideration''.
            (5) At the Washington Summit of the NATO Alliance in April 
        1999, the NATO heads of state and government issued a communique 
        declaring ``[w]e pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new 
        members in a position to further the principles of the [North 
        Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the 
        Euro-Atlantic area . . . [t]he three new members will not be the 
        last . . . [n]o European democratic country whose admission 
        would fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from 
        consideration, regardless of its geographic location . . .''.
            (6) In late 2002, NATO will hold a summit in Prague, the 
        Czech Republic, at which it will decide which additional 
        emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to invite to 
        join the Alliance in the next round of NATO enlargement.
            (7) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign ministers 
        of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Former 
        Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia 
        issued a statement (later joined by Croatia) declaring that 
        their countries will cooperate in jointly seeking NATO 
        membership in the next round of NATO enlargement, that the 
        realization of NATO membership by one or more of these countries 
        would be a success for all, and that eventual NATO membership 
        for all of these countries would be a success for Europe and 
        NATO.
            (8) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, 
        President George W. Bush stated ``[a]ll of Europe's new 
        democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie 
        between, should have the same chance for security and freedom--
        and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe--as 
        Europe's old democracies have . . . I believe in NATO membership 
        for all of Europe's democracies that seek it and are ready to 
        share the responsibilities that NATO brings . . . [a]s we plan 
        to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a pawn in the 
        agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade away the fate of free 
        European peoples . . . [n]o more Munichs . . . [n]o more Yaltas 
        . . . [a]s we plan the Prague Summit, we should not calculate 
        how little we can get away with, but how much we can do to 
        advance the cause of freedom''.
            (9) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, 
        former President William J. Clinton stated ``NATO's doors will 
        not close behind its first new members . . . NATO should remain 
        open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to 
        shoulder the responsibilities of membership . . . [n]o nation 
        will be automatically excluded . . . [n]o country outside NATO 
        will have a veto . . . [a] gray zone of insecurity must not 
        reemerge in Europe''.
