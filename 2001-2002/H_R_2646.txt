        making direct payments and counter-cyclical payments with 
        respect to a farm, the Secretary shall give an owner of the farm 
        an opportunity to elect 1 of the following as the method by 
        which the base acres of all covered commodities on the farm are 
        to be determined:
                    (A) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), the 4-year 
                average of the following:
                          (i) Acreage planted on the farm to covered 
                      commodities for harvest, grazing, haying, silage,

                      1998 through 2001 crop years to covered 
                      commodities because of

[[Page 116 STAT. 145]]

                      drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or 
                      other condition beyond the control of the 
                      producers, as determined by the Secretary.
                    (B) Subject to paragraph (3), the sum of the 
                following:
                          (i) The contract acreage (as defined in 
                      section 102 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement 
                      and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7202)) used by 
                      the Secretary to calculate the fiscal year 2002 
                      payment authorized under section 114 of such Act 
                      (7 U.S.C. 7214) for the covered commodities on the 
                      farm.
                          (ii) The 4-year average of eligible oilseed 
                      acreage on the farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop 
                      years, as determined by the Secretary under 
                      paragraph (2).
            (2) Eligible oilseed acreage.--
                    (A) Calculation.--For purposes of paragraph 
                (1)(B)(ii), the eligible acreage for each oilseed on a 
                farm during each of the 1998 through 2001 crop years 
                shall be determined in the manner provided in paragraph 
                (1)(A), except that the total acreage for all oilseeds 
                on the farm for a crop year may not exceed the 
                difference between--
                          (i) the total acreage determined under 
                      paragraph (1)(A) for all covered commodities for 
                      that crop year; and
                          (ii) the total contract acreage determined 
                      under paragraph (1)(B)(i).
                    (B) Effect of negative number.--If the subtraction 
                performed under subparagraph (A) results in a negative 
                number, the eligible oilseed acreage on the farm for 
                that crop year shall be zero for purposes of determining 
                the 4-year average.
                    (C) Offset of contract acreage.--The owner of a farm 
                may increase the eligible acreage for an oilseed on the 
                farm by reducing the contract acreage determined under 
                paragraph (1)(B)(i) for 1 or more covered commodities on 
                an acre-for-acre basis, except that the total base 
                acreage for each oilseed on the farm may not exceed the 
                4-year average of each oilseed determined under 
                paragraph (1)(B)(ii).
            (3) Inclusion of all 4 years in average.--For the purpose of 
        determining a 4-year acreage average under this subsection for a 
        farm, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in which a 
        covered commodity was not planted.
            (4) Treatment of multiple planting or prevented planting.--
        For the purpose of determining under paragraph (1)(A) the 
        acreage on a farm that producers planted or were prevented from 
        planting during the 1998 through 2001 crop years to covered 
        commodities, if the acreage that was planted or prevented from 
        being planted was devoted to another covered commodity in the 
        same crop year (other than a covered commodity produced under an 
        established practice of double cropping), the owner may elect 
        the commodity to be used for that crop year in determining the 
        4-year average, but may not include both the initial commodity 
        and the subsequent commodity.

    (b) Single Election; Time for Election.--
            (1) Notice of election opportunity.--As soon as practicable 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary

[[Page 116 STAT. 146]]

        shall provide notice to owners of farms regarding their 
        opportunity to make the election described in subsection (a). 
        The notice shall include the following:
                    (A) Notice that the opportunity of an owner to make 
                the election is being provided only once.
                    (B) Information regarding the manner in which the 
                election must be made and the time periods and manner in 
                which notice of the election must be submitted to the 
                Secretary.
            (2) Election deadline.--Within the time period and in the 
        manner prescribed pursuant to paragraph (1), the owner of a farm 
        shall submit to the Secretary notice of the election made by the 
        owner under subsection (a).

    (c) Effect of Failure To Make Election.--If the owner of a farm 
fails to make the election under subsection (a) or fails to timely 
notify the Secretary of the election made, as required by subsection 
(b), the owner shall be deemed to have made the election described in 
subsection (a)(1)(B) to determine base acres for all covered commodities 
on the farm.
    (d) Application of Election to All Covered Commodities.--The 
election made under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1), or 
deemed to be made under subsection (c), with respect to a farm shall 
apply to all of the covered commodities on the farm.
    (e) Treatment of Conservation Reserve Contract Acreage.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide for an 
        adjustment, as appropriate, in the base acres for covered 
        commodities for a farm whenever either of the following 
        circumstances occurs:
                    (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into 
                under section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 
                U.S.C. 3831) with respect to the farm expires or is 
                voluntarily terminated.
                    (B) Cropland is released from coverage under a 
                conservation reserve contract by the Secretary.
            (2) Special payment rules.--For the crop year in which a 
        base acres adjustment under paragraph (1) is first made, the 
        owner of the farm shall elect to receive either direct payments 
        and counter-cyclical payments with respect to the acreage added 
        to the farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under 
        the conservation reserve contract, but not both.

    (f) Payment Acres.--The payment acres for a covered commodity on a 
farm shall be equal to 85 percent of the base acres for the covered 
commodity.

    (g) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
            (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a 
        farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2), 
        exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary 
        shall reduce the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities 
        for the farm or the base acres for peanuts for the farm under 
        subtitle C so that the sum of the base acres and acreage 
        described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland 
        acreage of the farm.
            (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall include the following:

[[Page 116 STAT. 147]]

                    (A) Any base acres for peanuts for the farm under 
                subtitle C.
                    (B) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the 
                conservation reserve program or wetlands reserve program 
                under chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food 
                Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.).
                    (C) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a 
                conservation program for which payments are made in 
                exchange for not producing an agricultural commodity on 
                the acreage.
            (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner 
        of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres or the base 
        acres for peanuts for the farm under subtitle C against which 
        the reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.
            (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the case 
        of double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.
            (5) Coordinated application of requirements.--The Secretary 
        shall take into account section 1302(f) when applying the 
        requirements of this subsection.

    (h) Permanent Reduction in Base Acres.--The owner of a farm may 
reduce, at any time, the base acres for any covered commodity for the 
farm. The reduction shall be permanent and made in the manner prescribed 
by the Secretary.

SEC. 1102. ESTABLISHMENT OF PAYMENT YIELD.

    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making direct 
payments and counter-cyclical payments under this subtitle, the 
Secretary shall provide for the establishment of a payment yield for 
each farm for each covered commodity in accordance with this section.
    (b) Use of Farm Program Payment Yield.--Except as otherwise provided 
in this section, the payment yield for each of the 2002 through 2007 
crops of a covered commodity for a farm shall be the farm program 
payment yield established for the 1995 crop of the covered commodity 
under section 505 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1465), as 
adjusted by the Secretary to account for any additional yield payments 
made with respect to that crop under section 505(b)(2) of that Act.
    (c) Farms Without Farm Program Payment Yield.--In the case of a farm 
for which a farm program payment yield is unavailable for a covered 
commodity (other than soybeans or other oilseeds), the Secretary shall 
establish an appropriate payment yield for the covered commodity on the 
farm taking into consideration the farm program payment yields 
applicable to the commodity under subsection (b) for similar farms, but 
before the yields for the similar farms are updated as provided in 
subsection (e).
    (d) Payment Yields for Oilseeds.--
            (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of soybeans 
        and each other oilseed, the Secretary shall determine the 
        average yield per planted acre for the oilseed on a farm for the 
        1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which 
        the acreage planted to the oilseed was zero.
            (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--The payment yield for a 
        farm for an oilseed shall be equal to the product of the 
        following:

[[Page 116 STAT. 148]]

                    (A) The average yield for the oilseed determined 
                under paragraph (1).
                    (B) The ratio resulting from dividing the national 
                average yield for the oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 
                crops by the national average yield for the oilseed for 
                the 1998 through 2001 crops.
            (3) Use of partial county average yield.--If the yield per 
        planted acre for a crop of an oilseed for a farm for any of the 
        1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of the 
        county yield for that oilseed, the Secretary shall assign a 
        yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county yield 
        for the purpose of determining the average under paragraph (1).

    (e) Opportunity to Partially Update Yields Used to Determine 
Counter-Cyclical Payments.--
            (1) Election to update.--If the owner of a farm elects to 
        use the base acres calculation method described in section 
        1101(a)(1)(A), the owner shall also have a 1-time opportunity to 
        elect to use 1 of the methods described in paragraph (3) to 
        partially update the payment yields that would otherwise be used 
        in calculating any counter-cyclical payments for covered 
        commodities on the farm.
            (2) Time for election.--The election under paragraph (1) 
        shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as the 
        Secretary prescribes for the election required under section 
        1101.
            (3) Methods of updating yields.--If the owner of a farm 
        elects to update yields under this subsection, the payment yield 
        for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of 
        calculating counter-cyclical payments only, shall be equal to 
        the yield determined using either of the following:
                    (A) The sum of the following:
                          (i) The payment yield applicable for direct 
                      payments for the covered commodity on the farm.
                          (ii) 70 percent of the difference between--
                                    (I) the average yield per planted 
                                acre for the crop of the covered 
                                commodity on the farm for the 1998 
                                through 2001 crop years, as determined 
                                by the Secretary, excluding any crop 
                                year in which the acreage planted to the 
                                crop of the covered commodity was zero; 
                                and
                                    (II) the payment yield applicable 
                                for direct payments for the covered 
                                commodity on the farm.
                    (B) 93.5 percent of the average of the yield per 
                planted acre for the crop of the covered commodity on 
                the farm for the 1998 through 2001 crop years, as 
                determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in 
                which the acreage planted to the crop of the covered 
                commodity was zero.
            (4) Use of partial county average yield.--If the yield per 
        planted acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for 
        any of the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent 
        of the county yield for that commodity, the Secretary shall 
        assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the 
        county yield for the purpose of determining the average yield 
        under paragraph (3).
            (5) Application of election and method to all covered 
        commodities.--The owner of a farm may not elect the method

[[Page 116 STAT. 149]]

        described in paragraph (3)(A) for 1 covered commodity on the 
        farm and the method described in paragraph (3)(B) for other 
        covered commodities on the farm.

    (d) Time for Payment.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall make direct payments--
                    (A) in the case of the 2002 crop year, as soon as 
                practicable after the date of enactment of this Act; and
                    (B) in the case of each of the 2003 through 2007 
                crop years, not before October 1 of the calendar year in

            (2) Advance payments.--At the option of the producers on a 
        farm, up to 50 percent of the direct payment for a covered 
        commodity for any of the 2003 through 2007 crop years shall be 
        paid to the producers in advance. The producers shall select the 
        month within which the advance payment for a crop year will be 
        made. The month selected may be any month during the period 
        beginning on December 1 of the calendar year before the calendar 
        year in which the crop of the covered commodity is harvested 
        through the month within which the direct payment would 
        otherwise be made. The producers may change the selected month 
        for a subsequent advance payment by providing advance notice to 
        the Secretary.
            (3) Repayment of advance payments.--If a producer on a farm 
        that receives an advance direct payment for a crop year ceases 
        to be a producer on that farm, or the extent to which the 
        producer shares in the risk of producing a crop changes, before 
        the date the remainder of the direct payment is made, the 
        producer shall be responsible for repaying the Secretary the 
        applicable amount of the advance payment, as determined by the 
        Secretary.

    (f) Time for Payments.--
            (1) General rule.--If the Secretary determines under 
        subsection (a) that counter-cyclical payments are required to be 
        made under this section for the crop of a covered commodity, the 
        Secretary shall make the counter-cyclical payments for the crop 
        as soon as practicable after the end of the 12-month marketing 
        year for the covered commodity.
            (2) Availability of partial payments.--If, before the end of 
        the 12-month marketing year for a covered commodity, the 
        Secretary estimates that counter-cyclical payments will be 
        required for the crop of the covered commodity, the Secretary 
        shall give producers on a farm the option to receive partial 
        payments of the counter-cyclical payment projected to be made 
        for that crop of the covered commodity.

                    (A) 2002 through 2006 crop years.--
                          (i) First partial payment.--For each of the 
                      2002 through 2006 crop years of a covered 
                      commodity, the first partial payment under 
                      paragraph (3) to the producers on a farm may not 
                      exceed 35 percent of the projected counter-
                      cyclical payment for the covered commodity for the

                                revision thereof) for the crop of the 
                                covered commodity; and

                                payment to be made to the producers for 
                                the covered commodity for that crop 
                                year; and

        the equitable division of the payments among the parties by 
        adjusting the determination of who is the eligible peanut quota 
        holder with respect to particular pounds of the quota.

[[Page 116 STAT. 181]]

            (3) Effect of agreement for permanent quota transfer.--If 
        the Secretary determines that there was in existence, as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act, an agreement for the permanent 
        transfer of quota, but that the transfer was not completed by 
        that date, the Secretary shall consider the peanut quota holder 
        to be the party to the agreement who, as of that date, was the 
        owner of the farm to which the quota was to be transferred.
            (4) Protected bases.--A person that owns a farm with a 
        peanut poundage quota which is protected under a conservation 
        reserve program contract entered into under section 1231 of the 
        Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831) shall be considered 
        to be an eligible quota holder with respect to the protected 
        poundage.
            (5) Secretarial discretion.--Notwithstanding the preceding 
        paragraphs, the Secretary may declare a person to be the 
        eligible peanut quota holder with respect to certain pounds of 
        quota or otherwise for purposes of this section if the Secretary 
        considers the declaration is needed to insure a fair and 
        equitable administration of the payments provided for in this 
        section, so long as the Secretary does not, in exercising this 
        authority, effectively increase the total quota in excess of the 
        quota that was available to all producers for the 2001 crop year 
        for other than seed or experimental use.
            (6) Limitation on quantity of quota held.--A person shall be 
        considered an eligible peanut quota holder for purposes of this 
        section only with respect to that number of permanent pounds 
        that qualifies the person as a peanut quota holder under one of 
        the preceding paragraphs. The determination of the peanut 
        poundage amount for which the person qualifies shall be made 
        based on the 2001 crop quota levels and shall take into account 
        sales of the farm that occurred before the date of enactment of 
        this Act and any permanent transfers of quota that took place 
        before that date, consistent with the preceding paragraphs. The 
        Secretary shall not take into account, or allow eligibility for, 
        quotas for seed, granted as experimental quotas, or obtained by 
        temporary lease or transfer.

    (g) Successions in Payment Eligibility and Attachment of Eligibility 
to Persons.--
            (1) Eligibility attaches to persons.--Once a person is 
        eligible for payments under this section, as determined under 
        subsection (f), the continued eligibility of the person for the 
        payments does not run with a farm, but shall remain with the 
        person for the term of this section irrespective of whether the 
        person sells, or continues to have an interest in, the farm that 
        had the quota that qualified the person as an eligible peanut 
        quota holder under subsection (f) and irrespective of whether 
        the person has a continuing interest in the production of 
        peanuts.
            (2) Succession.--If a person eligible for payments under 
        this section dies, in the case of an individual, or ceases to 
        exist, in the case of other persons, the payment eligibility of 
        the person shall pass to the person's personal or organizational 
        successor, as determined by the Secretary.

        Secretary determines that negotiated reductions in export 
        subsidies and domestic subsidies provided for sugar of other 
        major sugar growing, producing, and exporting countries in the 
        aggregate exceed the commitments made as part of the Agreement 
        on Agriculture.
            ``(2) Extent of reduction.--The Secretary shall not reduce 
        the loan rate under subsection (a) or (b) below a rate that

        administrative requirement not otherwise in effect on the date 
        of enactment of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of

                          (i) proposes specific criteria and commitment 
                      of resources in the geographic region designated 
                      in the plan; and
                          (ii) describes how the linkage of Federal,

                                    (I) the economic viability of 
                                agriculture; and
                                    (II) the environmental integrity of 
                                the watersheds in the Delmarva 
                                Peninsula; and

                the plan, the State, local government, or combination of 
                States has solicited and taken into account the views of 
                local residents.
            (2) Draft memorandum of agreement.--If the conservation 
        corridor plan is submitted by more than 1 State, the plan shall 
        provide a draft memorandum of agreement among entities in each 
        submitting State.

    (c) Review <<NOTE: Deadline.>> of Plan.--Not later than 90 days 
after the date of receipt of a conservation corridor plan, the 
Secretary--
            (1) shall review the plan; and
            (2) may approve the plan for implementation under this 
        subtitle if the Secretary determines that the plan meets the 
        requirements specified in subsection (d).

    (d) Criteria for Approval.--The Secretary may approve a conservation 
corridor plan only if, as determined by the Secretary, the plan provides 
for each of the following:
            (1) Voluntary actions.--Actions taken under the plan--
                    (A) are voluntary;
                    (B) require the consent of willing landowners; and
                    (C) provide a mechanism by which the landowner may 
                withdraw such consent without adverse consequences other 
                than the loss of any payments to the landowner 
                conditioned on continued enrollment of the land.
            (2) Land of high conservation value.--Criteria specified in 
        the plan ensure that land enrolled in each conservation program 
        incorporated through the plan are of exceptionally high 
        conservation value, as determined by the Secretary.
            (3) No effect on unenrolled land.--The enrollment of land in 
        a conservation program incorporated through the plan will 
        neither--
                    (A) adversely affect any adjacent land not so 
                enrolled; nor
                    (B) create any buffer zone on such unenrolled land.
            (4) Greater benefits.--The conservation programs 
        incorporated through the plan provide benefits greater than the 
        benefits that would likely be achieved through individual 
        application of the conservation programs.
            (5) Sufficient staffing.--Staffing, considering both Federal 
        and non-Federal resources, is sufficient to ensure success of 
        the plan.

the Secretary determines that, in the implementation of the plan--
            (1) the State, local government, or combination of States 
        that submitted the plan has deviated from--
                    (A) the plan;
                    (B) the criteria specified in section 2602(d) on 
                which approval of the plan was conditioned; or
                    (C) the cost-sharing requirements of section 2604(a) 
                or any other condition of the plan; or
            (2) the economic viability of agriculture in the geographic 
        region designated in the plan is being hindered.

    (c) Progress Report.--At the end of the 3-year period that begins on 
the date on which funds are first provided with respect to a 
conservation corridor plan under the demonstration program, the State, 
local government, or combination of States that submitted the plan shall

        as a condition on the approval of a conservation corridor plan, 
        the Secretary shall require the State and local participants to 
        contribute financial resources sufficient to cover at least 50 
        percent of the total cost of the activities carried out under 
        the plan.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary may reduce the cost-sharing 
        requirement in the case of a specific project or activity under

        that the project or activity is likely to achieve extraordinary 
        natural resource benefits.

    (b) Reservation of Funds.--The Secretary may consider directing 
funds on a priority basis to the demonstration program and to projects 
in areas identified by the plan.

SEC. 3209. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the international community faces a continuing epidemic 
        of ethnic, sectarian, and criminal violence;
            (2) poverty, hunger, political uncertainty, and social 
        instability are the principal causes of violence and conflict 
        around the world;
            (3) broad-based, equitable economic growth and agriculture 
        development facilitates political stability, food security, 
        democracy, and the rule of law;
            (4) democratic governments are more likely to advocate and 
        observe international laws, protect civil and human rights, 
        pursue free market economies, and avoid external conflicts;
            (5) the United States Agency for International Development 
        has provided critical democracy and governance assistance to a 
        majority of the nations that successfully made the transition to 
        democratic governments during the past 2 decades;
            (6) 43 of the top 50 consumer nations of American 
        agricultural products were once United States foreign aid 
        recipients;
            (7) in the past 50 years, infant child death rates in the 
        developing world have been reduced by 50 percent, and health 
        conditions around the world have improved more during this 
        period than in any other period;
            (8) the United States Agency for International Development 
        child survival programs have significantly contributed to a 10 
        percent reduction in infant mortality rates worldwide in just 
        the past 8 years;
            (9) in providing assistance by the United States and other 
        donors in better seeds and teaching more efficient agricultural 
        techniques over the past 2 decades have helped make it possible 
        to feed an additional 1,000,000,000 people in the world;
            (10) despite this progress, approximately 1,200,000,000 
        people, one-quarter of the world's population, live on less that

[[Page 116 STAT. 303]]

        $1 per day, and approximately 3,000,000,000 people live on only 
        $2 per day;
            (11) 95 percent of new births occur in developing countries, 
        including the world's poorest countries; and
            (12) only \1/2\ percent of the Federal budget is dedicated 
        to international economic and humanitarian assistance.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States foreign assistance programs should play an 
        increased role in the global fight against terrorism to 
        complement the national security objectives of the United 
        States;
            (2) the United States should lead coordinated international 
        efforts to provide increased financial assistance to countries 
        with impoverished and disadvantaged populations that are the 
        breeding grounds for terrorism; and
            (3) the United States Agency for International Development 
        and the Department of Agriculture should substantially increase 
        humanitarian, economic development, and agricultural assistance 
        to foster international peace and stability and the promotion of 
        human rights.

SEC. 3210. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL TRADE.

    (a) Agriculture Trade Negotiating Objectives.--It is the sense of 
the Senate that the principal negotiating objective of the United States 
with respect to agricultural trade in all multilateral, regional, and 
bilateral negotiations is to obtain competitive opportunities for the 
export of United States agricultural commodities in foreign markets 
substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded 
foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and more 
open conditions of agricultural trade in bulk and value-added 
commodities by--
            (1) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or 
        other charges that decrease market opportunities for the export 
        of United States agricultural commodities, giving priority to 
        United States agricultural commodities that are subject to 
        significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major 
        producing countries;
            (2) immediately eliminating all export subsidies on 
        agricultural commodities worldwide while maintaining bona fide 
        food aid and preserving United States agricultural market 
        development and export credit programs that allow the United 
        States to compete with other foreign export promotion efforts;
            (3) leveling the playing field for United States 
        agricultural producers by disciplining domestic supports such 
        that no other country can provide greater support, measured as a 
        percentage of total agricultural production value, than the 
        United States does while preserving existing green box category 
        to support conservation activities, family farms, and rural 
        communities;
            (4) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and 
        effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate practices 
        that unfairly decrease United States market access opportunities 
        for United States agricultural commodities or distort 
        agricultural markets to the detriment of the United States, 
        including--
                    (A) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state 
                trading enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, 
                with emphasis on--

                      for agricultural commodities that amount to de

                      other mechanisms do not (except in cases of bona 
                      fide food aid) sell agricultural commodities in 
                      foreign markets at prices below domestic market 
                      prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring 
                      and delivering agricultural commodities to the

                restrictions, including restrictions that are not based

                Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and 
                Phytosanitary Measures (as described in section 
                101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
                3511(d)(3)));

                administration of tariff rate quotas;
            (5) improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the 
        unique characteristics of perishable agricultural commodities;
            (6) taking into account whether a party to negotiations with 
        respect to trading in an agricultural commodity has--
                    (A) failed to adhere to the provisions of an 
                existing bilateral trade agreement with the United 
                States;
                    (B) circumvented obligations under a multilateral 
                trade agreement to which the United States is a 
                signatory; or
                    (C) manipulated its currency value to the detriment 
                of United States agricultural producers or exporters; 
                and
            (7) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the 
        World Trade Organization--
                    (A) have made meaningful market liberalization 
                commitments in agriculture; and
                    (B) make progress in fulfilling those commitments 
                over time.

    (b) Priority for Agriculture Trade.--It is the sense of the Senate 
that--
            (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should be 
        the top priority of United States negotiators in World Trade 
        Organization talks; and
            (2) if the primary export competitors of the United States 
        fail to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and 
        eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating 
        objectives expressed in this section, the United States should 
        take steps to increase the leverage of United States negotiators 
        and level the playing field for United States producers, within 
        existing World Trade Organization commitments.

    (c) Consultation With Congressional Committees.--It is the sense of 
the Senate that--

[[Page 116 STAT. 305]]

            (1) before the United States Trade Representative negotiates 
        a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on agricultural 
        commodities or require a change in United States agricultural 
        law, the United States Trade Representative should consult with 
        the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Ways and Means 
        of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Committee on 
        Finance of the Senate;
            (2) not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement 
        relating to agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices of 
        the World Trade Organization, the United States Trade 
        Representative should consult closely with the committees 
        referred to in paragraph (1) regarding--
                    (A) the details of the agreement;
                    (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United 
                States agricultural producers; and
                    (C) any changes in United States law necessary to 
                implement the agreement; and
            (3) any agreement or other understanding (whether verbal or 
        in writing) that relates to agricultural trade that is not 
        disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a trade 
        agreement is introduced in either the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives should not be considered to be part of the 
        agreement approved by Congress and should have no force and 
        effect under Unites States law or in any dispute settlement 
        body.

    (a) Short Title; Findings.--
            (1) Short title.--This section may be cited as the

            (2) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
                    (A) There is a critical need for compassionate 
                individuals who are committed to assisting people who 
                suffer from hunger as well as a need for such 
                individuals to initiate and administer solutions to the 
                hunger problem.
                    (B) Bill Emerson, the distinguished late 
                Representative from the 8th District of Missouri, 
                demonstrated his commitment to solving the problem of 
                hunger in a bipartisan manner, his commitment to public 
                service, and his great affection for the institution and 
                the ideals of the United States Congress.
                    (C) George T. (Mickey) Leland, the distinguished 
                late Representative from the 18th District of Texas, 
                demonstrated his compassion for those in need, his high 
                regard for public service, and his lively exercise of 
                political talents.
                    (D) The special concern that Mr. Emerson and Mr. 
                Leland demonstrated during their lives for the hungry 
                and poor was an inspiration for others to work toward 
                the goals of equality and justice for all.
                    (E) These two outstanding leaders maintained a 
                special bond of friendship regardless of political 
                affiliation and worked together to encourage future 
                leaders to recognize and provide service to others, and 
                therefore it is especially appropriate to honor the 
                memory of Mr. Emerson and Mr. Leland by creating a 
                fellowship program to develop and train the future 
                leaders of the United States to pursue careers in 
                humanitarian service.

SEC. 7406. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOUBLING OF FUNDING FOR 
            AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Federal funding for food and agricultural research has 
        been essentially constant for 2 decades, putting at risk the 
        scientific base on which food and agricultural advances have 
        been made;
            (2) the resulting increase in the relative proportion of 
        private sector, industry investments in food and agricultural

SEC. 8003. <<NOTE: 16 USC 2106c note.>>  ENHANCED COMMUNITY FIRE 
            PROTECTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The severity and intensity of wildland fires has 
        increased dramatically over the past few decades as a result of 
        past fire and land management policies.
            (2) The record 2000 fire season is a prime example of what 
        can be expected if action is not taken.
            (3) Wildland fires threaten not only the forested resources 
        of the United States, but also the thousands of communities 
        intermingled with the wildlands in the wildland-urban interface.
            (4) The National Fire Plan, if implemented to achieve 
        appropriate priorities, is the proper, coordinated, and most 
        effective means to address the issue of wildfires.
            (5) While adequate authorities exist to tackle the wildfire 
        issues at the landscape level on Federal lands, there is limited 
        authority to take action on most private lands, and the largest 
        threat to life and property exists on private lands.
            (6) There is a significant Federal interest in enhancing 
        community protection from wildfire.

    (b) Enhanced Protection.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 
1978 is amended by inserting after section 10 (16 U.S.C. 2106) the 
following:

Secretary may cooperate with State foresters and equivalent State 
officials in the management of lands in the United States for the 
following purposes:
            ``(1) Aid in wildfire prevention and control.

            ``(3) Enhance the growth and maintenance of trees and 
        forests that promote overall forest health.
            ``(4) Ensure the continued production of all forest 
        resources, including timber, outdoor recreation opportunities, 
        wildlife habitat, and clean water, through conservation of 
        forest cover on watersheds, shelterbelts, and windbreaks.

    ``(b) Community and Private Land Fire Assistance Program.--
            ``(1) Establishment; purpose.--The Secretary shall establish 
        a Community and Private Land Fire Assistance program (in this 
        subsection referred to as the `Program')--
