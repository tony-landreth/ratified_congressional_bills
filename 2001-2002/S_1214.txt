                TITLE I--MARITIME TRANSPORTATION SECURITY

SEC. 101. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 46 USC 70101 note.>> 

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There are 361 public ports in the United States that are 
        an integral part of our Nation's commerce.
            (2) United States ports handle over 95 percent of United 
        States overseas trade. The total volume of goods imported and 
        exported through ports is expected to more than double over the 
        next 20 years.
            (3) The variety of trade and commerce carried out at ports 
        includes bulk cargo, containerized cargo, passenger transport 
        and tourism, and intermodal transportation systems that are 
        complex to secure.
            (4) The United States is increasingly dependent on imported 
        energy for a substantial share of its energy supply, and a 
        disruption of that share of supply would seriously harm 
        consumers and our economy.
            (5) The top 50 ports in the United States account for about 
        90 percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United States 
        ports account for 98 percent of all container shipments. Cruise 
        ships visiting foreign destinations embark from at least 16 
        ports. Ferries in the United States transport 113,000,000 
        passengers and 32,000,000 vehicles per year.
            (6) Ports often are a major locus of Federal crime, 
        including drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of 
        contraband and aliens.
            (7) Ports are often very open and exposed and are 
        susceptible to large scale acts of terrorism that could cause a 
        large loss of life or economic disruption.
            (8) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are 
        insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology is 
        currently not adequately deployed to allow for the nonintrusive 
        inspection of containerized cargo.
            (9) The cruise ship industry poses a special risk from a 
        security perspective.
            (10) Securing entry points and other areas of port 
        facilities and examining or inspecting containers would increase 
        security at United States ports.
            (11) Biometric identification procedures for individuals 
        having access to secure areas in port facilities are important

[[Page 116 STAT. 2067]]

        tools to deter and prevent port cargo crimes, smuggling, and 
        terrorist actions.
            (12) United States ports are international boundaries that--
                    (A) are particularly vulnerable to breaches in 
                security;
                    (B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the 
                United States to realize its national security 
                objectives; and
                    (C) may serve as a vector or target for terrorist 
                attacks aimed at the United States.
            (13) It is in the best interests of the United States--
                    (A) to have a free flow of interstate and foreign 
                commerce and to ensure the efficient movement of cargo;
                    (B) to increase United States port security by 
                establishing improving communication among law 
                enforcement officials responsible for port security;
                    (C) to formulate requirements for physical port 
                security, recognizing the different character and nature 
                of United States port facilities, and to require the 
                establishment of security programs at port facilities;
                    (D) to provide financial assistance to help the 
                States and the private sector to increase physical 
                security of United States ports;
                    (E) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate 
                the private sector development of technology that will 
                assist in the nonintrusive timely detection of crime or 
                potential crime at United States ports;
                    (F) to increase intelligence collection on cargo and 
                intermodal movements to address areas of potential 
                threat to safety and security; and
                    (G) to promote private sector procedures that 
                provide for in-transit visibility and support law 
                enforcement efforts directed at managing the security 
                risks of cargo shipments.
            (14) On April 27, 1999, the President established the 
        Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States 
        Ports to undertake a comprehensive study of the nature and 
        extent of the problem of crime in our ports, as well as the ways 
        in which governments at all levels are responding. The 
        Commission concluded that frequent crimes in ports include drug 
        smuggling, illegal car exports, fraud, and cargo theft. Internal 
        conspiracies are an issue at many ports and contribute to 
        Federal crime. Criminal organizations are exploiting weak 
        security at ports to commit a wide range of cargo crimes. 
        Intelligence and information sharing among law enforcement 
        agencies needs to be improved and coordinated at many ports. A 
        lack of minimum physical and personnel security standards at 
        ports and related facilities leaves many ports and port users 
        very vulnerable. Access to ports and operations within ports is 
        often uncontrolled. Security-related and detection-related 
        equipment, such as small boats, cameras, large-scale x-ray 
        machines, and vessel tracking devices, are lacking at many 
        ports.
            (15) The International Maritime Organization and other 
        similar international organizations are currently developing a 
        new maritime security system that contains the essential 
        elements for enhancing global maritime security. Therefore, it 
        is in the best interests of the United States to implement new 
        international instruments that establish such a system.

performance goals, up to 7 PC-170 patrol craft from the Department of 
Defense if it offers to transfer such craft.

SEC. 342. BOATING SAFETY.

    (a) General State Revenue Definition.--For fiscal year 2003, the 
term ``general State revenue'' in section 13102(a)(3) of title 46, 
United States Code, includes any amounts expended for the State's 
recreational boating safety program by a State agency, a public 
corporation established under State law, or any other State 
instrumentality, as determined by the Secretary of the department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating.
    (b) Funding.--For fiscal year 2003, the amount available for 
recreational boating safety under section 4(b)(3) of the Act of August 
9, 1950 (16 U.S.C. 777c(b)(3)), is $83,000,000.

SEC. 343. CARIBBEAN SUPPORT TENDER.

    (a) In General.--The Coast Guard is authorized to operate and 
maintain a Caribbean Support Tender (or similar type vessel) to provide 
technical assistance, including law enforcement training, for foreign 
coast guards, navies, and other maritime services.
    (b) Medical and Dental Care.--(1) The Commandant may provide medical

SEC. 345. GREAT LAKES LIGHTHOUSES. <<NOTE: 14 USC 92 note.>> 

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses. 
        One hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the 
        State of Michigan.
            (2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture 
        and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the 
        region's political, economic, and social history.

[[Page 116 STAT. 2107]]

            (3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great 
        Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In Michigan alone, approximately 70 
        lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal 
        Government and will be transferred to the General Services 
        Administration for disposal.
            (4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is 
        confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of 
        historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit 
        organizations. This is especially troubling because, in many 
        cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated 
        tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes 
        lighthouses.
            (5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be 
        unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.
            (6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed 
        Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic 
        Places.

    (b) Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation Efforts.--The 
Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may--
            (1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to 
        organizations in the Great Lakes region that are dedicated to 
        lighthouse stewardship; and
            (2) promptly release information regarding the timing of 
        designations of Coast Guard lighthouses on the Great Lakes as 
        excess to the needs of the Coast Guard, to enable those 
        organizations to mobilize and be prepared to take appropriate 
        action with respect to the disposal of those properties.
SEC. 346. <<NOTE: 14 USC 88 note.>>  MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL 
                        DISTRESS AND RESPONSE SYSTEM.

            (3) describe and map the existing public and private 
        communications coverage throughout the waters of the coastal and 
        internal regions of the continental United States, Alaska, 
        Hawaii, Guam, and the Caribbean, and identify locations that 
        possess direction-finding, asset-tracking communications, and 
        digital selective calling service;
            (4) identify areas of high risk to boaters and Coast Guard 
        personnel due to communications gaps;
            (5) specify steps taken by the Secretary to fill existing 
        gaps in coverage, including obtaining direction-finding 
        equipment, digital recording systems, asset-tracking 
        communications,

[[Page 116 STAT. 2108]]

        use of commercial VHF services, and digital selective calling 
        services that meet or exceed Global Maritime Distress and Safety 
        System requirements adopted under the International Convention

            (8) identify existing systems available to close all 
        identified marine safety gaps before January 1, 2003, including 
        expeditious receipt and response by appropriate Coast Guard 
        operations centers to VHF-FM digital selective calling distress 
        signal; and
            (9) identify actions taken to-date to implement the 
        recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board in 
        its Report No. MAR-99-01.

required to be eligible for financial assistance under this section, the 
financial assistance shall be terminated. The Secretary may request the 
member to reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same 
ratio to the total costs of the education provided to that member as the 
unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty 
the member agreed to serve. The Secretary shall have the option to order 
such reimbursement without first ordering the member to active duty. An 
obligation to reimburse the United States imposed under this paragraph 
is a debt owed to the United States.

(f) of a member who becomes unqualified to serve on active duty due to a 
circumstance not within the control of that member or who is not 
physically qualified for appointment and who is determined to be 
unqualified for service as an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve 
due to a physical or medical condition that was not the result of the 
member's own misconduct or grossly negligent conduct.
    ``(3) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is entered less 
than 5 years after the termination of a written agreement entered into 
under subsection (b) does not discharge the individual signing the 
agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph 
(1).

education' has the meaning given that term in section 101 of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001).''.
