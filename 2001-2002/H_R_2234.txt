SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 410ss note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Tumacacori Mission in southern Arizona was declared a 
        National Monument in 1908 in recognition of its great histor- 
        ical significance as ``one of the oldest mission ruins in the 
        southwest''.
            (2) In establishing Tumacacori National Historical Park in 
        1990 to include the Tumacacori Mission and the ruins of the 
        mission of Los Santos Angeles de Guevavi and the Kino visita and 
        rancheria of Calabazas, Congress recognized the importance of 
        these sites ``to protect and interpret, for the education and 
        benefit of the public, sites in the State of Arizona associated 
        with the early Spanish missionaries and explorers of the 17th 
        and 18th centuries''.
            (3) Tumacacori National Historical Park plays a major role 
        in interpreting the Spanish colonial heritage of the United 
        States.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to protect and interpret the resources associated with 
        the Tumacacori Mission by revising the boundary of Tumacacori 
        National Historical Park to include approximately 310 acres of 
        land adjacent to the park; and
            (2) to enhance the visitor experience at Tumacacori by 
        developing access to these associated mission resources.

        sentence: ``The park shall also consist of approximately 310 
        acres of land adjacent to the original Tumacacori unit of the 
        park and generally depicted on the map entitled `Tumacacori 
        National Historical Park, Arizona Proposed Boundary Revision
