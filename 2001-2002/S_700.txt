Public Law 107-9
107th Congress

                                 An Act


 
    To establish a Federal interagency task force for the purpose of 
   coordinating actions to prevent the outbreak of bovine spongiform 
  encephalopathy (commonly known as ``mad cow disease'') and foot-and-
 mouth disease in the United States. <<NOTE: May 24, 2001 -  [S. 700]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Animal Disease 
Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001.>> 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Disease Risk Assessment, 
Prevention, and Control Act of 2001''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) it is in the interest of the United States to maintain 
        healthy livestock herds;
            (2) managing the risks of foot-and-mouth disease, bovine 
        spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United 
        States may require billions of dollars for remedial activities 
        by consumers, producers, and distributors of livestock and 
        animal and blood products;
            (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the 
        United States would cause devastating financial losses to--
                    (A) the agriculture industry and other economic 
                sectors; and
                    (B) United States trade in the affected animals and 
                animal products;
            (4) foot-and-mouth disease is a severe and highly contagious 
        viral infection affecting cattle, deer, goats, sheep, swine, and 
        other animals;
            (5) the most effective means of eradicating foot-and-mouth 
        disease is by the slaughter of affected animals;
            (6) while foot-and-mouth disease was eradicated in the 
        United States in 1929, the virus could be reintroduced by--
                    (A) a single infected animal, an animal product, or 
                a person carrying the virus;
                    (B) an act of terrorism; or
                    (C) other means;
            (7) once introduced, foot-and-mouth disease can spread 
        quickly through--
                    (A) exposure to aerosols from infected animals;
                    (B) direct contact with infected animals; and
                    (C) contact with contaminated feed, equipment, or 
                humans harboring the virus or carrying the virus on 
                their clothing;

[[Page 115 STAT. 12]]

            (8) foot-and-mouth disease is endemic to more than \2/3\ of 
        the world and is considered to be widespread in parts of Africa, 
        Asia, Europe, and South America;
            (9) foot-and-mouth disease occurs in over 7 different 
        serotypes and 60 subtypes;
            (10) as foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks have occurred, the 
        United States has banned the importation of live ruminants and 
        swine and many animal products from countries affected by foot-
        and-mouth disease;
            (11) recently, the United States has implemented bans in 
        response to outbreaks in Argentina, the European Union, and 
        Taiwan;
            (12) although United States exclusion programs have been 
        successful at keeping foot-and-mouth disease out of the United 
        States since 1929, recent outbreaks in Argentina, the European 
        Union, and Taiwan are placing an unprecedented strain on our 
        animal health system;
            (13) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a transmissible, 
        neuro-degenerative disease found in cattle;
            (14) in cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the 
        active agent is found primarily in the brain and spinal cord and 
        has not been found in commonly consumed beef products;
            (15) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is thought to have an 
        incubation period of several years but is ultimately fatal to 
        cattle within weeks of onset of the active disease;
            (16) bovine spongiform encephalopathy was first widely found 
        in 1986 in cattle in the United Kingdom;
            (17) bovine spongiform encephalopathy-carrying cattle have 
        been found in cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, 
        Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
        Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland;
            (18) cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
        originating from the United Kingdom have been found and 
        intercepted in Canada;
            (19) since 1989, the Secretary of Agriculture has prohibited 
        the importation of live grazing animals from countries where 
        bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been found in cattle;
            (20) other products derived from grazing animals, such as 
        blood meal, bonemeal, fat, fetal bovine serum, glands, meat-and-
        bone meal, and offal, are prohibited from entry, except under 
        special conditions or under permits issued by the Secretary of 
        Agriculture for scientific or research purposes;
            (21) on December 12, 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture 
        extended those restrictions to include all countries in Europe 
        because of concerns about widespread risk factors and inadequate 
        surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy;
            (22) on December 7, 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture 
        prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products from 
        Europe;
            (23) Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is a human spongiform 
        encephalopathy;
            (24) on March 20, 1996, the Spongiform Encephalopathy 
        Advisory Committee of the United Kingdom announced the 
        identification of 10 cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob 
        disease;
            (25) all 10 patients developed onsets of the disease in 1994 
        or 1995;

[[Page 115 STAT. 13]]

            (26) scientific experts (including scientists at the 
        Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human 
        Services, and the World Health Organization) are studying the 
        possible link (including potential routes of transmission) 
        between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant 
        Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease;
            (27) from October 1996 to December 2000, 87 cases of variant 
        Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported in the United 
        Kingdom, 3 cases in France, and 1 case in Ireland; and
            (28) to reduce the risk of human spongiform encephalopathies 
        in the United States, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has--
                    (A) banned individuals who lived in Great Britain 
                for at least 180 days since 1980 from donating blood in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) established regulations that prohibit the 
                feeding of most animal-derived proteins to grazing 
                animals.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the people of 
the United States and Congress with information concerning--
            (1) actions by Federal agencies to prevent foot-and-mouth 
        disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases;
            (2) the sufficiency of legislative authority to prevent or 
        control foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform 
        encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United States;
            (3) the economic impacts associated with the potential 
        introduction of foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform 
        encephalopathy, and related diseases into the United States; and
            (4) the risks to public health from possible links between 
        bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other spongiform 
        encephalopathies to human illnesses.
