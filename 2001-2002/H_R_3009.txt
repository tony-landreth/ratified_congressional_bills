            PROCEDURES.

    (a) Cargo Information.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), not 
        later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary shall promulgate regulations providing for the 
        transmission to the Customs Service, through an electronic data 
        interchange system, of information pertaining to cargo destined 
        for importation into the United States or exportation from the 
        United States, prior to such importation or exportation.
            (2) Information required.--The information required by the 
        regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) under the 
        parameters set forth in paragraph (3) shall be such information 
        as the Secretary determines to be reasonably necessary to ensure 
        aviation, maritime, and surface transportation safety and 
        security pursuant to those laws enforced and administered by the 
        Customs Service.
            (3) Parameters.--In developing regulations pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adhere to the following 
        parameters:
                    (A) The Secretary shall solicit comments from and 
                consult with a broad range of parties likely to be 
                affected by the regulations, including importers, 
                exporters, carriers, customs brokers, and freight 
                forwarders, among other interested parties.

[[Page 116 STAT. 982]]

                    (B) In general, the requirement to provide 
                particular information shall be imposed on the party 
                most likely to have direct knowledge of that 
                information. Where requiring information from the party 
                with direct knowledge of that information is not 
                practicable, the regulations shall take into account 
                how, under ordinary commercial practices, information is 
                acquired by the party on which the requirement is 
                imposed, and whether and how such party is able to 
                verify the information. Where information is not 
                reasonably verifiable by the party on which a 
                requirement is imposed, the regulations shall permit 
                that party to transmit information on the basis of what 
                it reasonably believes to be true.
                    (C) The Secretary shall take into account the 
                existence of competitive relationships among the parties 
                on which requirements to provide particular information 
                are imposed.
                    (D) Where the regulations impose requirements on 
                carriers of cargo, they shall take into account 
                differences among different modes of transportation, 
                including differences in commercial practices, 
                operational characteristics, and technological capacity 
                to collect and transmit information electronically.
                    (E) The regulations shall take into account the 
                extent to which the technology necessary for parties to 
                transmit and the Customs Service to receive and analyze 
                data in a timely fashion is available. To the extent 
                that the Secretary determines that the necessary 
                technology will not be widely available to particular 
                modes of transportation or other affected parties until 
                after promulgation of the regulations, the regulations 
                shall provide interim requirements appropriate for the 
                technology that is available at the time of 
                promulgation.
                    (F) The information collected pursuant to the 
                regulations shall be used exclusively for ensuring 
                aviation, maritime, and surface transportation safety 
                and security, and shall not be used for determining 
                entry or for any other commercial enforcement purposes.
                    (G) The regulations shall protect the privacy of 
                business proprietary and any other confidential 
                information provided to the Customs Service. However, 
                this parameter does not repeal, amend, or otherwise 
                modify other provisions of law relating to the public 
                disclosure of information transmitted to the Customs 
                Service.
                    (H) In determining the timing for transmittal of any 
                information, the Secretary shall balance likely impact 
                on flow of commerce with impact on aviation, maritime,

            DIVISION B--BIPARTISAN TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY

  TITLE XXI--TRADE <<NOTE: Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 
2002.>> PROMOTION AUTHORITY

SEC. 2101. <<NOTE: 19 USC 3801.>> SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Trade 
Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the 
        national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the 
        economic growth and strength of the United States and to its 
        leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships promote 
        security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same 
        purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding 
        nations together through a series of mutual rights and 
        obligations. Leadership by the United States in international 
        trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the 
        world.
            (2) The national security of the United States depends on 
        its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant 
        and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine 
        of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for 
        the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the 
        United States, such as information technology, 
        telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic 
        industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, 
        agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual 
        property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United 
        States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United 
        States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United 
        States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, 
        will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
            (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that 
        dispute settlement procedures under international trade 
        agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations 
        provided in such agreements. Therefore--
                    (A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute 
                settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to 
                impose obligations and restrictions on the use of 
                antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by 
                WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the 
                Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and 
                the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and
                    (B) the Congress is concerned that dispute 
                settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body 
                appropriately apply the standard of review contained in 
                Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide 
                deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO 
                member of provisions of that Agreement, and to the 
                evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that 
                evaluation is unbiased and objective and the 
                establishment of the facts is proper.

SEC. 2102. <<NOTE: 19 USC 3802.>> TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.

    (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall trade 
negotiating objectives of the United States for agreements subject to 
the provisions of section 2103 are--
            (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market 
        access;
            (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and 
        distortions that are directly related to trade and that decrease 
        market opportunities for United States exports or otherwise 
        distort United States trade;
            (3) to further strengthen the system of international 
        trading disciplines and procedures, including dispute 
        settlement;
            (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, and 
        promote full employment in the United States and to enhance the 
        global economy;
            (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are 
        mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the 
        environment and enhance the international means of doing so, 
        while optimizing the use of the world's resources;
            (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of 
        children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as 
        defined in section 2113(6)) and an understanding of the 
        relationship between trade and worker rights;
            (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which 
        parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not 
        weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic 
        environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;
            (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses 
        equal access to international markets, equitable trade benefits, 
        and expanded export market opportunities, and provide for the 
        reduction or elimination of trade barriers that 
        disproportionately impact small businesses; and
            (9) to promote universal ratification and full compliance 
        with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and 
        Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
        Labor.

    (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--
            (1) Trade barriers and distortions.--The principal 
        negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade 
        barriers and other trade distortions are--
                    (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for 
                United States exports and to obtain fairer and more open 
                conditions of trade by reducing or eliminating tariff 
                and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of 
                foreign governments directly related to trade that 
                decrease market opportunities for United States exports 
                or otherwise distort United States trade; and
                    (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff 
                barrier elimination agreements, with particular 
                attention to those tariff categories covered in section 
                111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
                3521(b)).
            (2) Trade in services.--The principal negotiating objective 
        of the United States regarding trade in services is to reduce or 
        eliminate barriers to international trade in services, including 
        regulatory and other barriers that deny national treatment and 
        market access or unreasonably restrict the establishment or 
        operations of service suppliers.

[[Page 116 STAT. 995]]

            (3) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law 
        on the whole provides a high level of protection for investment, 
        consistent with or greater than the level required by 
        international law, the principal negotiating objectives of the 
        United States regarding foreign investment are to reduce or 
        eliminate artificial or trade-distorting barriers to foreign 
        investment, while ensuring that foreign investors in the United 
        States are not accorded greater substantive rights with respect 
        to investment protections than United States investors in the 
        United States, and to secure for investors important rights 
        comparable to those that would be available under United States 
        legal principles and practice, by--
                    (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the 
                principle of national treatment;
                    (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to 
                investments;
                    (C) reducing or eliminating performance 
                requirements, forced technology transfers, and other 
                unreasonable barriers to the establishment and operation 
                of investments;
                    (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation 
                and compensation for expropriation, consistent with 
                United States legal principles and practice;
                    (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and 
                equitable treatment consistent with United States legal 
                principles and practice, including the principle of due 
                process;
                    (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving 
                investment disputes;
                    (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve 
                disputes between an investor and a government through--
                          (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims 
                      and to deter the filing of frivolous claims;
                          (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient 
                      selection of arbitrators and the expeditious 
                      disposition of claims;
                          (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for 
                      public input into the formulation of government 
                      positions; and
                          (iv) providing for an appellate body or 
                      similar mechanism to provide coherence to the 
                      interpretations of investment provisions in trade 
                      agreements; and
                    (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in 
                the dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent 
                consistent with the need to protect information that is 
                classified or business confidential, by--
                          (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute 
                      settlement are promptly made public;
                          (ii) ensuring that--
                                    (I) all proceedings, submissions, 
                                findings, and decisions are promptly 
                                made public; and
                                    (II) all hearings are open to the 
                                public; and
                          (iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance 
                      of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, 
                      unions, and nongovernmental organizations.
            (4) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States regarding trade-related 
        intellectual property are--

                protection of intellectual property rights, including

                      governing intellectual property rights that is 
                      entered into by the United States reflect a

                      accessible, expeditious, and effective civil, 
                      administrative, and criminal enforcement 
                      mechanisms;

                that rely upon intellectual property protection; and
                    (C) to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS

            (5) Transparency.--The principal negotiating objective of 
        the United States with respect to transparency is to obtain 
        wider and broader application of the principle of transparency 
        through--
                    (A) increased and more timely public access to 
                information regarding trade issues and the activities of 
                international trade institutions;
                    (B) increased openness at the WTO and other

                appropriate meetings, proceedings, and submissions, 
                including with regard to dispute settlement and 
                investment; and
                    (C) increased and more timely public access to all 
                notifications and supporting documentation submitted by

            (6) Anti-corruption.--The principal negotiating objectives 
        of the United States with respect to the use of money or other 
        things of value to influence acts, decisions, or omissions of 
        foreign governments or officials or to secure any improper 
        advantage in a manner affecting trade are--

[[Page 116 STAT. 997]]

                    (A) to obtain high standards and appropriate 
                domestic enforcement mechanisms applicable to persons 
                from all countries participating in the applicable trade 
                agreement that prohibit such attempts to influence acts, 
                decisions, or omissions of foreign governments; and
                    (B) to ensure that such standards do not place 
                United States persons at a competitive disadvantage in 
                international trade.
            (7) Improvement of the wto and multilateral trade

        Organization, the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other 
        multilateral and bilateral trade agreements are--
                    (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the 
                coverage of the World Trade Organization and such 
                agreements to products, sectors, and conditions of trade 
                not adequately covered; and

                enhancement of the Information Technology Agreement and 
                other trade agreements.
            (8) Regulatory practices.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States regarding the use of government 
        regulation or other practices by foreign governments to provide 
        a competitive advantage to their domestic producers, service 
        providers, or investors and thereby reduce market access for 
        United States goods, services, and investments are--
                    (A) to achieve increased transparency and 
                opportunity for the participation of affected parties in 
                the development of regulations;
                    (B) to require that proposed regulations be based on 
                sound science, cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, 
                or other objective evidence;
                    (C) to establish consultative mechanisms among 
                parties to trade agreements to promote increased 
                transparency in developing guidelines, rules, 
                regulations, and laws for government procurement and 
                other regulatory regimes; and
                    (D) to achieve the elimination of government 
                measures such as price controls and reference pricing 
                which deny full market access for United States 
                products.
            (9) Electronic commerce.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States with respect to electronic 
        commerce are--
                    (A) to ensure that current obligations, rules, 
                disciplines, and commitments under the World Trade 
                Organization apply to electronic commerce;
                    (B) to ensure that--
                          (i) electronically delivered goods and 
                      services receive no less favorable treatment under 
                      trade rules and commitments than like products 
                      delivered in physical form; and
                          (ii) the classification of such goods and 
                      services ensures the most liberal trade treatment 
                      possible;
                    (C) to ensure that governments refrain from 
                implementing trade-related measures that impede 
                electronic commerce;
                    (D) where legitimate policy objectives require 
                domestic regulations that affect electronic commerce, to 
                obtain

[[Page 116 STAT. 998]]

                commitments that any such regulations are the least 
                restrictive on trade, nondiscriminatory, and 
                transparent, and promote an open market environment; and
                    (E) to extend the moratorium of the World Trade 
                Organization on duties on electronic transmissions.
            (10) Reciprocal trade in agriculture.--(A) The principal 
        negotiating objective of the United States with respect to 
        agriculture is to obtain competitive opportunities for United 
        States exports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets 
        substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities 
        afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to achieve 
        fairer and more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty 
        crop, and value-added commodities by--
                    (i) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, 
                tariffs or other charges that decrease market 
                opportunities for United States exports--
                          (I) giving priority to those products that are 
                      subject to significantly higher tariffs or subsidy 
                      regimes of major producing countries; and
                          (II) providing reasonable adjustment periods 
                      for United States import-sensitive products, in 
                      close consultation with the Congress on such 
                      products before initiating tariff reduction 
                      negotiations;
                    (ii) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as 
                or lower than those in the United States;
                    (iii) reducing or eliminating subsidies that 
                decrease market opportunities for United States exports 
                or unfairly distort agriculture markets to the detriment 
                of the United States;
                    (iv) allowing the preservation of programs that 
                support family farms and rural communities but do not 
                distort trade;
                    (v) developing disciplines for domestic support 
                programs, so that production that is in excess of 
                domestic food security needs is sold at world prices;
                    (vi) eliminating government policies that create 
                price-depressing surpluses;
                    (vii) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever 
                possible;
                    (viii) developing, strengthening, and clarifying 
                rules and effective dispute settlement mechanisms to 
                eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States 
                market access opportunities or distort agricultural 
                markets to the detriment of the United States, 
                particularly with respect to import-sensitive products, 
                including--
                          (I) unfair or trade-distorting activities of 
                      state trading enterprises and other administrative 
                      mechanisms, with emphasis on requiring price 
                      transparency in the operation of state trading 
                      enterprises and such other mechanisms in order to 
                      end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and 
                      price undercutting;
                          (II) unjustified trade restrictions or 
                      commercial requirements, such as labeling, that 
                      affect new technologies, including biotechnology;
                          (III) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary 
                      restrictions, including those not based on 
                      scientific principles in contravention of the 
                      Uruguay Round Agreements;

[[Page 116 STAT. 999]]

                          (IV) other unjustified technical barriers to 
                      trade; and
                          (V) restrictive rules in the administration of 
                      tariff rate quotas;
                    (ix) eliminating practices that adversely affect 
                trade in perishable or cyclical products, while 
                improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the 
                unique characteristics of perishable and cyclical 
                agriculture;
                    (x) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for 
                perishable and cyclical agriculture are as accessible 
                and timely to growers in the United States as those 
                mechanisms that are used by other countries;
                    (xi) taking into account whether a party to the 
                negotiations has failed to adhere to the provisions of 
                already existing trade agreements with the United States 
                or has circumvented obligations under those agreements;
                    (xii) taking into account whether a product is 
                subject to market distortions by reason of a failure of 
                a major producing country to adhere to the provisions of 
                already existing trade agreements with the United States 
                or by the circumvention by that country of its 
                obligations under those agreements;
                    (xiii) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede 
                to the World Trade Organization have made meaningful 
                market liberalization commitments in agriculture;
                    (xiv) taking into account the impact that agreements 
                covering agriculture to which the United States is a 
                party, including the North American Free Trade 
                Agreement, have on the United States agricultural 
                industry;
                    (xv) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs 
                and preserving United States market development and 
                export credit programs; and
                    (xvi) striving to complete a general multilateral 
                round in the World Trade Organization by January 1, 
                2005, and seeking the broadest market access possible in 
                multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations, 
                recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of 
                negotiations may have on United States import-sensitive 
                commodities (including those subject to tariff-rate 
                quotas).
            (B)(i) Before commencing negotiations with respect to 
        agriculture, the United States Trade Representative, in 
        consultation with the Congress, shall seek to develop a position 
        on the treatment of seasonal and perishable agricultural 
        products to be employed in the negotiations in order to develop 
        an international consensus on the treatment of seasonal or 
        perishable agricultural products in investigations relating to 
        dumping and safeguards and in any other relevant area.
            (ii) During any negotiations on agricultural subsidies, the 
        United States Trade Representative shall seek to establish the 
        common base year for calculating the Aggregated Measurement of 
        Support (as defined in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end 
        of each country's Uruguay Round implementation period, as 
        reported in each country's Uruguay Round market access schedule.
            (iii) The negotiating objective provided in subparagraph (A) 
        applies with respect to agricultural matters to be addressed in 
        any trade agreement entered into under section 2103(a)

[[Page 116 STAT. 1000]]

        or (b), including any trade agreement entered into under section 
        2103(a) or (b) that provides for accession to a trade agreement 
        to which the United States is already a party, such as the North 
        American Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Canada Free 
        Trade Agreement.
            (11) Labor and the environment.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States with respect to labor and the 
        environment are--
                    (A) to ensure that a party to a trade agreement with 
                the United States does not fail to effectively enforce 
                its environmental or labor laws, through a sustained or 
                recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner 
                affecting trade between the United States and that party 
                after entry into force of a trade agreement between 
                those countries;
                    (B) to recognize that parties to a trade agreement 
                retain the right to exercise discretion with respect to 
                investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance 
                matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation 
                of resources to enforcement with respect to other labor 
                or environmental matters determined to have higher 
                priorities, and to recognize that a country is 
                effectively enforcing its laws if a course of action or 
                inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such 
                discretion, or results from a bona fide decision 
                regarding the allocation of resources, and no 
                retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of 
                these rights or the right to establish domestic labor 
                standards and levels of environmental protection;
                    (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States 
                trading partners to promote respect for core labor 
                standards (as defined in section 2113(6));
                    (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States 
                trading partners to protect the environment through the 
                promotion of sustainable development;
                    (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or 
                policies that unduly threaten sustainable development;
                    (F) to seek market access, through the elimination 
                of tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States 
                environmental technologies, goods, and services; and
                    (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or 
                safety policies and practices of the parties to trade 
                agreements with the United States do not arbitrarily or 
                unjustifiably discriminate against United States exports 
                or serve as disguised barriers to trade.
            (12) Dispute settlement and enforcement.--The principal 
        negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to 
        dispute settlement and enforcement of trade agreements are--
                    (A) to seek provisions in trade agreements providing 
                for resolution of disputes between governments under 
                those trade agreements in an effective, timely, 
                transparent, equitable, and reasoned manner, requiring 
                determinations based on facts and the principles of the 
                agreements, with the goal of increasing compliance with 
                the agreements;
                    (B) to seek to strengthen the capacity of the Trade 
                Policy Review Mechanism of the World Trade Organization 
                to review compliance with commitments;

[[Page 116 STAT. 1001]]

                    (C) to seek adherence by panels convened under the 
                Dispute Settlement Understanding and by the Appellate

                including greater deference, where appropriate, to the 
                fact-finding and technical expertise of national 
                investigating authorities;
                    (D) to seek provisions encouraging the early 
                identification and settlement of disputes through 
                consultation;
                    (E) to seek provisions to encourage the provision of 
                trade-expanding compensation if a party to a dispute 
                under the agreement does not come into compliance with 
                its obligations under the agreement;
                    (F) to seek provisions to impose a penalty upon a 
                party to a dispute under the agreement that--
                          (i) encourages compliance with the obligations 
                      of the agreement;
                          (ii) is appropriate to the parties, nature,

                      enforcement mechanism; and
                    (G) to seek provisions that treat United States

            (13) WTO extended negotiations.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States regarding trade in civil 
        aircraft are those set forth in section 135(c) of the Uruguay 
        Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3355(c)) and regarding rules of 
        origin are the conclusion of an agreement described in section 
        132 of that Act (19 U.S.C. 3552).
            (14) Trade remedy laws.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States with respect to trade remedy 
        laws are--
                    (A) to preserve the ability of the United States to 
                enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the 
                antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws, 
                and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of 
                domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, 
                especially dumping and subsidies, or that lessen the 
                effectiveness of domestic and international safeguard 
                provisions, in order to ensure that United States 
                workers, agricultural producers, and firms can compete 
                fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of reciprocal 
                trade concessions; and
                    (B) to address and remedy market distortions that 
                lead to dumping and subsidization, including 
                overcapacity, cartelization, and market-access barriers.
            (15) Border taxes.--The principal negotiating objective of 
        the United States regarding border taxes is to obtain a revision 
        of the WTO rules with respect to the treatment of border 
        adjustments for internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to 
        countries relying primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather 
        than indirect taxes.

[[Page 116 STAT. 1002]]

            (16) Textile Negotiations.--The principal negotiating 
        objectives of the United States with respect to trade in 
        textiles and apparel articles are to obtain competitive 
        opportunities for United States exports of textiles and apparel 
        in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the competitive 
        opportunities afforded foreign exports in United States markets 
        and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in 
        textiles and apparel.
            (17) Worst Forms of Child Labor.--The principal negotiating 
        objective of the United States with respect to the trade-related 
        aspects of the worst forms of child labor are to seek 
        commitments by parties to trade agreements to vigorously enforce 
        their own laws prohibiting the worst forms of child labor.

        Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate 
        Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, 
        and report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on

            (3) seek to establish 
        consultative <<NOTE: Reports.>> mechanisms among parties to 
        trade agreements to strengthen the capacity of United States 
        trading partners to develop and implement standards for the 
        protection of the environment and human health based on sound 
        science, and report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the

            (4) conduct environmental reviews of future trade and 
        investment agreements, consistent with Executive Order 13141 of 
        November 16, 1999, and its relevant guidelines, and report to 
        the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives 
        and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on such reviews;
            (5) review the impact of future trade agreements on United 
        States employment, including labor markets, modeled after 
        Executive Order 13141 to the extent appropriate in establishing 
        procedures and criteria, report to the Committee on Ways and 
        Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Finance of the Senate on such review, and make that report 
        available to the public;
            (6) take into account other legitimate United States 
        domestic objectives including, but not limited to, the 
        protection of legitimate health or safety, essential security,

        thereto;
            (7) direct the Secretary of Labor to consult with any 
        country seeking a trade agreement with the United States 
        concerning that country's labor laws and provide technical 
        assistance to that country if needed;

[[Page 116 STAT. 1003]]

            (8) in connection with any trade negotiations entered into 
        under this Act, submit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the 
        House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the 
        Senate a meaningful labor rights report of the country, or 
        countries, with respect to which the President is negotiating, 
        on a time frame determined in accordance with section 
        2107(b)(2)(E);
            (9) with respect to any trade agreement which the President 
        seeks to implement under trade authorities procedures, submit to

        or countries that are parties to the agreement have in effect 
        laws governing exploitative child labor;
            (10) continue to promote consideration of multilateral 
        environmental agreements and consult with parties to such

        includes trade measures with existing environmental exceptions 
        under Article XX of the GATT 1994;
            (11) report to the Committee on <<NOTE: Reports.>> Ways and 
        Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Finance of the Senate, not later than 12 months after the 
        imposition of a penalty or remedy by the United States permitted 
        by a trade agreement to which this title applies, on the 
        effectiveness of the penalty or remedy applied under United 
        States law in enforcing United States rights under the trade 
        agreement; and
            (12) seek to establish consultative mechanisms among parties 
        to trade agreements to examine the trade consequences of 
        significant and unanticipated currency movements and to 
        scrutinize whether a foreign government engaged in a pattern of 
        manipulating its currency to promote a competitive advantage in 
        international trade.

The report under paragraph (11) shall address whether the penalty or 
remedy was effective in changing the behavior of the targeted party and 
whether the penalty or remedy had any adverse impact on parties or 
interests not party to the dispute.
    (d) Consultations.--

obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements.

SEC. 2103. <<NOTE: 19 USC 3803.>> TRADE AGREEMENTS AUTHORITY.

    (a) Agreements Regarding Tariff Barriers.--
            (1) In general.--Whenever the President determines that one 
        or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any 
        foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and 
        restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the 
        purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this title 
        will be promoted thereby, the President--
                    (A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign 
                countries before--
                          (i) June 1, 2005; or
                          (ii) June 1, 2007, if trade authorities 
                      procedures are extended under subsection (c); and
                    (B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), 
                proclaim--
                          (i) such modification or continuance of any 
                      existing duty,
                          (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or 
                      excise treatment, or
                          (iii) such additional duties,
                as the President determines to be required or 
                appropriate to carry out any such trade agreement.
        The President <<NOTE: President. Notification.>> shall notify 
        the Congress of the President's intention to enter into an 
        agreement under this subsection.
            (2) Limitations.--No proclamation may be made under 
        paragraph (1) that--
                    (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of 
                duty that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the 
                date of the enactment of this Act) to a rate of duty 
                which is less than 50 percent of the rate of such duty 
                that applies on such date of enactment;
                    (B) reduces the rate of duty below that applicable 
                under the Uruguay Round Agreements, on any import 
                sensitive agricultural product; or
                    (C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that 
                applied on the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (3) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging.--
                    (A) Aggregate reduction.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), the aggregate reduction in the rate of 
                duty on any article which is in effect on any day 
                pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under 
                paragraph (1) shall not exceed the aggregate reduction 
                which would have been in effect on such day if--

[[Page 116 STAT. 1005]]

                          (i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a 
                      reduction of one-tenth of the total reduction, 
                      whichever is greater, had taken effect on the 
                      effective date of the first reduction proclaimed 
                      under paragraph (1) to carry out such agreement 
                      with respect to such article; and
                          (ii) a reduction equal to the amount 
                      applicable under clause (i) had taken effect at 1-
                      year intervals after the effective date of such 
                      first reduction.
                    (B) Exemption from staging.--No staging is required 
                under subparagraph (A) with respect to a duty reduction 
                that is proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of 
                a kind that is not produced in the United States. The 
                United States International Trade Commission shall 
                advise the President of the identity of articles that 
                may be exempted from staging under this subparagraph.
            (4) Rounding.--If the President determines that such action 
        will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph (3), 
        the President may round an annual reduction by an amount equal 
        to the lesser of--
                    (A) the difference between the reduction without 
                regard to this paragraph and the next lower whole 
                number; or
                    (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
            (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction that may 
        not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph (2) may take effect 
        only if a provision authorizing such reduction is included 
        within an implementing bill provided for under section 2105 and 
        that bill is enacted into law.
            (6) Other tariff modifications.--Notwithstanding paragraphs 
        (1)(B), (2)(A), (2)(C), and (3) through (5), and subject to the 
        consultation and layover requirements of section 115 of the 
        Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the President may proclaim the 
        modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty 
        set forth in Schedule XX, as defined in section 2(5) of that 
        Act, if the United States agrees to such modification or staged 
        rate reduction in a negotiation for the reciprocal elimination 
        or harmonization of duties under the auspices of the World Trade 
        Organization.
            (7) Authority under uruguay round agreements act not 
        affected.--Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority 
        provided to the President under section 111(b) of the Uruguay 
        Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).

            (1) In general.--(A) Whenever the President determines 
        that--
                    (i) one or more existing duties or any other import 
                restriction of any foreign country or the United States 
                or any other barrier to, or other distortion of, 
                international trade unduly burdens or restricts the 
                foreign trade of the United States or adversely affects 
                the United States economy, or
                    (ii) the imposition of any such barrier or 
                distortion is likely to result in such a burden, 
                restriction, or effect,
        and that the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of 
        this title will be promoted thereby, the President may enter 
        into a trade agreement described in subparagraph (B) during the 
        period described in subparagraph (C).

                imposition of, such barrier or other distortion.
            (C) The President may enter into a trade agreement under 
        this paragraph before--

                    (ii) June 1, 2007, if trade authorities procedures 
                are extended under subsection (c).
            (2) Conditions.--A trade agreement may be entered into under 
        this subsection only if such agreement makes progress in meeting 
        the applicable objectives described in section 2102(a) and (b) 
        and the President satisfies the conditions set forth in section 
        2104.

        The provisions of section 151 of the Trade Act of 1974 (in this 
        title referred to as ``trade authorities procedures'') apply to 
        a bill of either House of Congress which contains provisions 
        described in subparagraph (B) to the same extent as such section 
        151 applies to implementing bills under that section. A bill to 
        which this paragraph applies shall hereafter in this title be 
        referred to as an ``implementing bill''.

                such trade agreement; and
                    (ii) if changes in existing laws or new statutory 
                authority are required to implement such trade agreement 
                or agreements, provisions, necessary or appropriate to 
                implement such trade agreement or agreements, either 
                repealing or amending existing laws or providing new 
                statutory authority.

    (c) Extension Disapproval Process for Congressional Trade 
Authorities Procedures.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in section 2105(b)--
                    (A) the trade authorities procedures apply to 
                implementing bills submitted with respect to trade 
                agreements entered into under subsection (b) before July

SEC. 2104. <<NOTE: 19 USC 3804.>> CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENT.

    (a) Notice <<NOTE: President.>> and Consultation Before 
Negotiation.--The President, with respect to any agreement that is 
subject to the provisions of section 2103(b), shall--
            (1) provide, at least 90 calendar days before initiating 
        negotiations, written notice to the Congress of the President's 
        intention to enter into the negotiations and set forth therein 
        the date the President intends to initiate such negotiations, 
        the specific United States objectives for the negotiations, and 
        whether the President intends to seek an agreement, or changes 
        to an existing agreement;
            (2) before and after submission of the notice, consult 
        regarding the negotiations with the Committee on Finance of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
        Representatives, such other committees of the House and Senate 
        as the President deems appropriate, and the Congressional 
        Oversight group convened under section 2107; and

        Congressional Oversight Group under section 2107(c), meet with 
        the Congressional Oversight Group before initiating the 
        negotiations or at any other time concerning the negotiations.

    (b) Negotiations Regarding Agriculture.--
            (1) In general.--Before initiating or continuing 
        negotiations the subject matter of which is directly related to 
        the subject matter under section 2102(b)(10)(A)(i) with any 
        country,

[[Page 116 STAT. 1009]]

        the President shall assess whether United States tariffs on 
        agricultural products that were bound under the Uruguay Round 
        Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound by that country. In 
        addition, the President shall consider whether the tariff levels 
        bound and applied throughout the world with respect to imports 
        from the United States are higher than United States tariffs and 
        whether the negotiation provides an opportunity to address any 
        such disparity. The President shall consult with the Committee 
        on Ways and Means and the Committee on Agriculture of the House 
        of Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the 
        Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate 
        concerning the results of the assessment, whether it is 
        appropriate for the United States to agree to further tariff 
        reductions based on the conclusions reached in the assessment, 
        and how all applicable negotiating objectives will be met.
            (2) Special consultations on import sensitive products.--(A) 
        Before initiating negotiations with regard to agriculture, and, 
        with respect to the Free Trade Area for the Americas and 
        negotiations with regard to agriculture under the auspices of 
        the World Trade Organization, as soon as practicable after the 
        enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative 
        shall--
                    (i) identify those agricultural products subject to 
                tariff-rate quotas on the date of enactment of this Act, 
                and agricultural products subject to tariff reductions 
                by the United States as a result of the Uruguay Round 
                Agreements, for which the rate of duty was reduced on 
                January 1, 1995, to a rate which was not less than 97.5 
                percent of the rate of duty that applied to such article 
                on December 31, 1994;
                    (ii) consult with the Committee on Ways and Means 
                and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of 
                Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the 
                Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the 
                Senate concerning--
                          (I) whether any further tariff reductions on 
                      the products identified under clause (i) should be 
                      appropriate, taking into account the impact of any 
                      such tariff reduction on the United States 
                      industry producing the product concerned;
                          (II) whether the products so identified face 
                      unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary 
                      restrictions, including those not based on 
                      scientific principles in contravention of the 
                      Uruguay Round Agreements; and
                          (III) whether the countries participating in 
                      the negotiations maintain export subsidies or 
                      other programs, policies, or practices that 
                      distort world trade in such products and the 
                      impact of such programs, policies, and practices 
                      on United States producers of the products;
                    (iii) request that the International Trade 
                Commission prepare an assessment of the probable 
                economic effects of any such tariff reduction on the 
                United States industry producing the product concerned 
                and on the United States economy as a whole; and

[[Page 116 STAT. 1010]]

                    (iv) upon complying with clauses (i), (ii), and 
                (iii), notify the Committee on Ways and Means and the 
                Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives

                Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate of 
                those products identified under clause (i) for which the 
                Trade Representative intends to seek tariff 
                liberalization in the negotiations and the reasons for 
                seeking such tariff liberalization.
            (B) If, after negotiations described in subparagraph (A) are 
        commenced--
                    (i) the United States Trade Representative 
                identifies any additional agricultural product described 
                in subparagraph (A)(i) for tariff reductions which were 
                not the subject of a notification under subparagraph 
                (A)(iv), or
                    (ii) any additional agricultural product described 
                in subparagraph (A)(i) is the subject of a request for 
                tariff reductions by a party to the negotiations,
        the Trade Representative shall, as soon as practicable, notify 
        the committees referred to in subparagraph (A)(iv) of those 
        products and the reasons for seeking such tariff reductions.
            (3) Negotiations regarding the fishing industry.--Before 
        initiating, or continuing, negotiations which directly relate to 
        fish or shellfish trade with any country, the President shall 
        consult with the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee 
        on Resources of the House of Representatives, and the Committee 
        on Finance and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
        Transportation of the Senate, and shall keep the Committees 
        apprised of negotiations on an ongoing and timely basis.

    (c) Negotiations Regarding Textiles.--Before initiating or 
continuing negotiations the subject matter of which is directly related 
to textiles and apparel products with any country, the President shall 
assess whether United States tariffs on textile and apparel products 
that were bound under the Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the 
tariffs bound by that country and whether the negotiation provides an 
opportunity to address any such disparity. The President shall consult 
with the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Finance of the Senate concerning the results of the 
assessment, whether it is appropriate for the United States to agree to 
further tariff reductions based on the conclusions reached in the 
assessment, and how all applicable negotiating objectives will be met.

                                the applicable purposes, policies, and 
                                objectives referred to in clause (i);

        country that is not a party to a trade agreement entered into 
        under section 2103(b) does not receive benefits under the

                    (B) is not disclosed to the Congress before an 
                implementing bill with respect to that agreement is 
                introduced in either House of Congress,
        shall not be considered to be part of the agreement approved by 
        the Congress and shall have no force and effect under United 
        States law or in any dispute settlement body.

    (b) Limitations on Trade Authorities Procedures.--
            (1) For lack of notice or consultations.--
                    (A) In general.--The trade authorities procedures

                disapproval resolution'' means a resolution of either 
                House of Congress, the sole matter after the resolving

    The grant of trade promotion authority under this title is likely to 
increase the activities of the primary committees of jurisdiction in the 
area of international trade. In addition, the creation of the 
Congressional Oversight Group under section 2107 will increase the 
participation of a broader number of Members of Congress in the 
formulation of United States trade policy and oversight of the 
international trade agenda for the United States. The primary committees 
of jurisdiction should have adequate staff to accommodate these 
increases in activities.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in 
        1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade with 
        Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has doubled, 
        with the United States serving as the leading source of imports 
        and leading export market for each of the Andean beneficiary 
        countries. This has resulted in increased jobs and expanded 
        export opportunities in both the United States and the Andean 
        region.
            (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element 
        in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean 
        region, promoting export diversification and broad-based 
        economic development that provides sustainable economic 
        alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the 
        legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable 
        alternatives to illicit trade in coca.
            (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade 
        Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by 
        political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable to 
        the consequences of the drug war and fierce global competition 
        for its legitimate trade.
            (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a 
        threat to the security interests of the United States and the 
        world. This problem has been partially addressed through foreign 
        aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in 2000. 
        However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. Enhancement of 
        legitimate trade with the United States provides an alternative 
        means for reviving and stabilizing the economies in the Andean 
        region.
            (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible 
        commitment by the United States to the promotion of prosperity, 
        stability, and democracy in the beneficiary countries.
            (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference 
        Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private enterprise 
        and foreign investors in the economic prospects of the region, 
        ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can be the engine of 
        economic development and political stability in the region.
            (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed to 
        conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the 
        year 2005, as a means of enhancing the economic security of the 
        region.
            (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean 
        beneficiary countries will promote the growth of free enterprise

        and economic opportunity in these countries and serve the 
        security interests of the United States, the region, and the 
        world.
