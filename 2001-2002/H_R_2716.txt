SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. <<NOTE: 38 USC 2001 note.>> 

    For purposes of this Act:
            (1) The term ``homeless veteran'' has the meaning given such 
        term in section 2002 of title 38, United States Code, as added 
        by section 5(a)(1).
            (2) The term ``grant and per diem provider'' means an entity 
        in receipt of a grant under section 2011 or 2012 of title 38, 
        United States Code, as so added.

SEC. 3. <<NOTE: 38 USC 2001 note.>>  NATIONAL GOAL TO END HOMELESSNESS 
            AMONG VETERANS.

    (a) National Goal.--Congress hereby declares it to be a national 
goal to end chronic homelessness among veterans within a decade of the 
enactment of this Act.

[[Page 115 STAT. 904]]

    (b) Cooperative Efforts Encouraged.--Congress hereby encourages all 
departments and agencies of Federal, State, and local governments, 
quasi-governmental organizations, private and public sector entities, 
including community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and 
individuals to work cooperatively to end chronic homelessness among 
veterans within a decade.

SEC. 4. <<NOTE: 38 USC 2001 note.>>  SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING THE 
            NEEDS OF HOMELESS VETERANS AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FEDERAL 
            AGENCIES.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) homelessness is a significant problem in the veterans 
        community and veterans are disproportionately represented among 
        homeless men;
            (2) while many effective programs assist homeless veterans 
        to again become productive and self-sufficient members of 
        society, current resources provided to such programs and other 
        activities that assist homeless veterans are inadequate to 
        provide all needed essential services, assistance, and support 
        to homeless veterans;
            (3) the most effective programs for the assistance of 
        homeless veterans should be identified and expanded;
            (4) federally funded programs for homeless veterans should 
        be held accountable for achieving clearly defined results;
            (5) Federal efforts to assist homeless veterans should 
        include prevention of homelessness; and
            (6) Federal agencies, particularly the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development, and the Department of Labor, should cooperate more 
        fully to address the problem of homelessness among veterans.
