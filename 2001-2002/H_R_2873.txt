               TITLE I--PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES

   Subtitle A--Grants to States for Promoting Safe and Stable Families

SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    Section 430 (42 U.S.C. 629) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 430. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that there is a continuing 
urgent need to protect children and to strengthen families as 
demonstrated by the following:
            ``(1) Family support programs directed at specific 
        vulnerable populations have had positive effects on parents, 
        children, or both. The vulnerable populations for which programs 
        have been shown to be effective include teenage mothers with 
        very young children and families that have children with special 
        needs.
            ``(2) Family preservation programs have been shown to 
        provide extensive and intensive services to families in crisis.
            ``(3) The time lines established by the Adoption and Safe 
        Families Act of 1997 have made the prompt availability of 
        services to address family problems (and in particular the 
        prompt availability of appropriate services and treatment 
        addressing substance abuse) an important factor in successful 
        family reunification.
            ``(4) The rapid increases in the annual number of adoptions 
        since the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 
        1997 have created a growing need for postadoption services and 
        for service providers with the particular knowledge and skills 
        required to address the unique issues adoptive families and 
        children may face.

    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this program is to enable States to 
develop and establish, or expand, and to operate coordinated programs of 
community-based family support services, family preservation services, 
time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and 
support services to accomplish the following objectives:
            ``(1) To prevent child maltreatment among families at risk 
        through the provision of supportive family services.
            ``(2) To assure children's safety within the home and 
        preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, 
        when the family's problems can be addressed effectively.
            ``(3) To address the problems of families whose children 
        have been placed in foster care so that reunification may occur 
        in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the Adoption and 
        Safe Families Act of 1997.
            ``(4) To support adoptive families by providing support 
        services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime 
        commitment to their children.''.

SEC. 121. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.

amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 439. <<NOTE: 42 USC 629i.>> GRANTS FOR PROGRAMS FOR MENTORING 
            CHILDREN OF PRISONERS.

    ``(a) Findings and Purpose.--
            ``(1) Findings.--
                    ``(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the 
                number of children with a parent incarcerated in a 
                Federal or State correctional facility increased by more 
                than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to 
                approximately 2,000,000. In 1999, 2.1 percent of all 
                children in the United States had a parent in Federal or 
                State prison.
                    ``(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female 
                prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State 
                facilities lived with their children.
                    ``(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of 
                incarcerated fathers live with their mothers, and 79 
                percent of the children of incarcerated mothers live 
                with a grandparent or other relative.
                    ``(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to 
                stress, trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems 
                for children. These problems are coupled with existing 
                problems that include poverty, violence, parental 
                substance abuse, high-crime environments, intrafamilial 
                abuse, child abuse and neglect, multiple care givers, 
                and/or prior separations. As a result, these children 
                often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, 
                health, and educational problems that are often 
                compounded by the pain of separation.
                    ``(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring 
                is a potent force for improving children's behavior 
                across all risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, 
                one-on-one relationships that provide young people with 
                caring role models for future success have profound, 
                life-changing potential. Done right, mentoring markedly 
                advances youths' life prospects. A widely cited 1995 
                study by Public/Private Ventures measured the impact of 
                one Big Brothers Big Sisters program and found 
                significant effects in the lives of youth--cutting 
                first-time drug use by almost half and first-time

[[Page 115 STAT. 2420]]

                alcohol use by about a third, reducing school 
                absenteeism by half, cutting assaultive behavior by a 
                third, improving parental and peer relationships, giving 
                youth greater confidence in their school work, and 
                improving academic performance.
            ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to authorize 
        the Secretary to make competitive grants to applicants in areas 
        with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated parents, to 
        support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs 
        using a network of public and private community entities to 
        provide mentoring services for children of prisoners.

    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Children of prisoners.--The term `children of 
        prisoners' means children one or both of whose parents are 
        incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local correctional 
        facility. The term is deemed to include children who are in an 
        ongoing mentoring relationship in a program under this section

        screened and trained adult volunteers for one-on-one

        basis, intended to meet, in part, the child's need for 
        involvement with a caring and supportive adult who provides a 
        positive role model.
            ``(3) Mentoring services.--The term `mentoring services' 
        means those services and activities that support a structured, 
        managed program of mentoring, including the management by 
        trained personnel of outreach to, and screening of, eligible 
        children; outreach to, education and training of, and liaison 
        with sponsoring local organizations; screening and training of 
        adult volunteers; matching of children with suitable adult 
        volunteer mentors; support and oversight of the mentoring 
        relationship; and establishment of goals and evaluation of 
        outcomes for mentored children.

quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the 
State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
Act. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of a State that

year legislative session, each year of the session shall be deemed to be 
a separate regular session of the State legislature.
