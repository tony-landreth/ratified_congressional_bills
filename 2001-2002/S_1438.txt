                        MILITARY EDUCATION REFORMS.

    (a) Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide for an 
independent study of the joint officer management system and the joint 
professional military education system. The Secretary shall ensure that 
the entity conducting the study is provided such 
information <<NOTE: Reports. Deadline.>> and support as required. The 
Secretary shall include in the contract for the study a requirement that 
the entity conducting the study submit a report to Congress on the study 
not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.

entity conducting the independent study shall provide for the following:
            (1) Assessment of implications for joint officer education, 
        development, and management that would result from proposed 
        joint organizational operational concepts (such as standing 
        joint task forces) and from emerging officer management and

        officer management system to develop and use joint specialty

[[Page 115 STAT. 1100]]

                assignments) to qualify an officer as a joint specialty 
                officer, as well as the implications of adopting a 
                variable joint duty tour length and the advisability and 
                implications of a system of qualifying officers as joint 
                specialty officers that uses multiple shorter 
                qualification tracks to selection as a joint specialty 
                officer than are now codified.
                    (B) The system of using joint specialty officers, 
                including the continued utility of such measures as--

                          (iv) current promotion policy objectives for 
                      officers with the joint specialty, officers 
                      serving on the Joint Staff, and officers serving

                officers the required joint specialty qualification 
                before promotion to general or flag officer grade.

                component officers who would be qualified for 
                designation as a joint specialty officer by reason of 
                experience or education if the standards of existing 
                law, including waiver authorities, were applied to them, 
                and recommendations for a process for qualifying and 
                employing future reserve component officers as joint 
                specialty officers.

        military education programs before an officer's first joint duty 
        assignment.

[[Page 115 STAT. 1101]]

            (3) Recommended goals for attendance at the Joint Forces 
        Staff College en route to a first joint duty assignment.
            (4) An assessment of the continuing utility of statutory

        military education, as prescribed by section 662(d) of title 10,

            (5) Determination of whether joint professional military 
        education programs should remain principally an in-resident, 
        multi-service experience and what role non-resident or 
        distributive learning can or should play in future joint 
        professional military education programs.
            (6) Examination of options for the length of and increased

                        CIVILIAN PERSONNEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
                        DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The role and importance of civilian nationals of the 
        United States as Federal employees and contractors in support of 
        operations of the Armed Forces worldwide has continued to 
        expand.
            (2) The expanded role performed by those civilians, both in 
        the United States and overseas, has greatly increased the risk 
        to those civilians of injury and death from hostile actions 
        taken against United States Armed Forces, as demonstrated by the 
        terrorist attack on the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, in which 
        scores of Department of Defense civilian and contractor 
        personnel were killed or wounded.
            (3) On September 20, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
        approved the creation of a new award, a medal for the defense of 
        freedom, to be awarded to civilians employed by the Department 
        of Defense who are killed or wounded as a result of hostile 
        action and at the same time directed that a comprehensive review 
        be conducted to develop a more uniform approach to the award of 
        decorations to military and civilian personnel of the Department 
        of Defense.

    (b) Commendation of Creation of New Award.--Congress commends the 
decision announced by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on September 20, 
2001, to approve the creation of a new award, a medal for the defense of 
freedom, to be awarded to civilians employed by the Department of 
Defense who are killed or wounded as a result of hostile action.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should act expeditiously to develop a

[[Page 115 STAT. 1119]]

more comprehensive, uniform policy for the award of decorations to 
military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense 
        Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-433) envisioned that 
        officers would be selected for recommendation to the President 
        for appointment as the commander of a combatant command under 
        chapter 6 of title 10, United States Code (as added by that 
        Act), on the basis of being the best qualified officer for that 
        position, rather than the best qualified officer of the armed 
        force that had historically supplied officers to serve in that 
        position.
            (2) In order to provide for greater competition among the 
        Armed Forces for selection of officers for assignment as the

[[Page 115 STAT. 1128]]

        commanders of the combatant commands and assignment to certain 
        other joint positions in the grade of general or admiral, 
        Congress provided temporary relief from the limitation on the 
        number of officers serving on active duty in the grade of 
        general or admiral in section 405 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter extended 
        that relief until September 30, 2003, but has also required that 
        the Secretary of Defense be furnished the name of at least one 
        officer from each of the Armed Forces for consideration for 
        appointment to each such position.
            (3) Most of the positions of commanders of the combatant 
        commands have been filled successively by officers of more than 
        one of the Armed Forces since the enactment of the Goldwater-
        Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.
            (4) However, general officers of the Air Force with only 
        limited experience in the transportation services have usually 
        filled the position of commander of the United States 
        Transportation Command.
            (5) The United States Transportation Command could benefit 
        from the appointment of future commanders selected from the 
        Army, Navy and Marine Corps, in addition to the Air Force.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense, when considering officers for recommendation to 
the President for appointment as commander of the United States 
Transportation Command, should not rely upon officers of one service 
which has traditionally provided officers to fill that position but 
should select for such recommendation the best qualified officer of the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.

home health care or custodial care services provided to an eligible

regulations implementing chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code.

Management Program for which the Secretary provided payment.

                        SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Armed Forces should give careful consideration to 
        implementing transformation to meet operational challenges and 
        exploit opportunities resulting from changes in the threat 
        environment and the emergence of new technologies.
            (2) The Department of Defense 2001 Quadrennial Defense 
        Review Report, issued by the Secretary of Defense on September 
        30, 2001, states that ``The purpose of transformation is to 
        maintain or improve U.S. military preeminence in the face of 
        potential disproportionate discontinuous changes in the 
        strategic environment. Transformation must therefore be focused 
        on emerging strategic and operational challenges and the 
        opportunities created by these challenges.''.
            (3) That report further states that ``To support the 
        transformation effort, and to foster innovation and 
        experimentation, the Department will establish a new office 
        reporting directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of 
        Defense.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress on Functions of Office of Force 
Transformation.--It is the sense of Congress that the Director of the 
Office of Force Transformation within the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense should advise the Secretary on--
            (1) development of force transformation strategies to ensure 
        that the military of the future is prepared to dissuade 
        potential military competitors and, if that fails, to fight and 
        win decisively across the spectrum of future conflict;
            (2) ensuring a continuous and broadly focused transformation 
        process;
            (3) service and joint acquisition and experimentation 
        efforts, funding for experimentation efforts, promising 
        operational concepts and technologies, and other transformation 
        activities, as appropriate; and
            (4) development of service and joint operational concepts, 
        transformation implementation strategies, and risk management 
        strategies.

[[Page 115 STAT. 1195]]

    (c) Sense of Congress on Funding.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of Defense should consider providing funding adequate for 
sponsoring selective prototyping efforts, war games, and studies and 
analyses and for appropriate staffing, as recommended by the Director of 
the Office of Force Transformation referred to in subsection (b).

by the non-Federal employer for at least 12 months, the Secretary may 
pay to the employer a prorated amount of what would have been the full 
retraining incentive if the eligible employee had remained employed for 
such 12-month period.
    (b) Eligible Employees.--For purposes of this section, an eligible 
employee is an employee of the Department of Defense, serving under an 
appointment without time limitation, who has been employed by the

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Rocky Flats National Wildlife 
Refuge Act of 2001''.

SEC. 3172. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy 
        Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began 
        operations there in 1952. The site remains a Department of 
        Energy facility. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats site 
        has changed from the production of nuclear weapons components to 
        cleanup and closure in a manner that is safe, environmentally 
        and socially responsible, physically secure, and cost-effective.
            (2) The majority of the Rocky Flats site has generally 
        remained undisturbed since its acquisition by the Federal 
        Government.
            (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth 
        and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front 
        Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. That growth 
        and development reduces the amount of open space and thereby 
        diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities the vistas 
        of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.

[[Page 115 STAT. 1380]]

            (4) Some areas of the Rocky Flats site contain contamination 
        and will require further response action. The national interest 
        requires that the ongoing cleanup and closure of the entire site 
        be completed safely, effectively, and without unnecessary delay 
        and that the site thereafter be retained by the United States 
        and managed so as to preserve the value of the site for open 
        space and wildlife habitat.
            (5) The Rocky Flats site provides habitat for many wildlife 
        species, including a number of threatened and endangered 
        species, and is marked by the presence of rare xeric tallgrass 
        prairie plant communities. Establishing the site as a unit of 
        the National Wildlife Refuge System will promote the 
        preservation and enhancement of those resources for present and 
        future generations.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) to provide for the establishment of the Rocky Flats site 
        as a national wildlife refuge following cleanup and closure of 
        the site;
            (2) to create a process for public input on the management 
        of the refuge referred to in paragraph (1) before transfer of 
        administrative jurisdiction to the Secretary of the Interior; 
        and
            (3) to ensure that the Rocky Flats site is thoroughly and 
        completely cleaned up.
