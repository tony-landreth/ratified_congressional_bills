        but who--
                    ``(A) accepts joint and several liability with a

                an employment-based immigrant under paragraph (4) and 
                who demonstrates (as provided under paragraph (6)) the

                alien, meets the requirements of paragraph (1) (other 
                than subparagraph (D)), and executes an affidavit of 
                support with respect to such alien in a case in which--
                          ``(i) the individual petitioning under section 
                      204 for the classification of such alien died 
                      after the approval of such petition; and
                          ``(ii) the Attorney General has determined for 
                      humanitarian reasons that revocation of such 
                      petition under section 205 would be 
                      inappropriate.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment permitting substitution.--Section 
        212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C)(ii)) is

        additional sponsor required under section 213A(f) or any 
        alternative sponsor permitted under paragraph (5)(B) of such 
        section)''.
            (3) Additional conforming amendments.--Section 213A(f) of 
        such Act (8 U.S.C. 1183a(f)) is amended, in each of paragraphs 
        (2) and (4)(B)(ii), by striking ``(5).'' and inserting 
        ``(5)(A).''.

    (b) Effective <<NOTE: Applicability. 8 USC 1182 note.>> Date.--The 
amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to deaths 
occurring before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
except that, in the case of a death occurring before such date, such 
amendments shall apply only if--
            (1) the sponsored alien--
                    (A) requests the Attorney General to reinstate the 
                classification petition that was filed with respect to 
                the alien by the deceased and approved under section 204 
                of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) 
                before such death; and
                    (B) demonstrates that he or she is able to satisfy 
                the requirement of section 212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of such Act 
                (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4)(C)(ii)) by reason of such 
                amendments; and
            (2) the Attorney General reinstates such petition after 
        making the determination described in section 213A(f)(5)(B)(ii) 
        of such Act (as amended by subsection (a)(1) of this Act).
