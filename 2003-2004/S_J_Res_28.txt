Public Law 108-236
108th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
   Recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Allied landing at Normandy 
     during World War II. <<NOTE: June 15, 2004 -  [S.J. Res. 28]>> 

Whereas June 6, 2004, marks the 60th anniversary of D-Day, the first day 
    of the Allied landing at Normandy during World War II by American, 
    British, and Canadian troops;
Whereas the D-Day landing, known as Operation Overlord, was the most 
    extensive amphibious operation ever to occur, involving on the first 
    day of the operation 5,000 naval vessels, more than 11,000 sorties 
    by Allied aircraft, and 153,000 members of the Allied Expeditionary 
    Force;
Whereas the bravery and sacrifices of the Allied troops at 5 separate 
    Normandy beaches and numerous paratrooper and glider landing zones 
    began what Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower called a 
    ``Crusade in Europe'' to end Nazi tyranny and restore freedom and 
    human dignity to millions of people;
Whereas that great assault by sea and air marked the beginning of the 
    end of Hitler's ambition for world domination;
Whereas American troops suffered over 6,500 casualties on D-Day; and
Whereas the people of the United States should honor the valor and 
    sacrifices of their fellow countrymen, both living and dead, who 
    fought that day for liberty and the cause of freedom in Europe: Now, 
    therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Allied landing at 
        Normandy during World War II; and

[[Page 118 STAT. 660]]

            (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling 
        on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary 
        with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the sacrifices 
        of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.

    Approved June 15, 2004.
