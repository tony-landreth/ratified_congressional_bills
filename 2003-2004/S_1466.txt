entitlement, the Secretary may waive the filing deadlines under sections 
12 and 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1611, 
1615) if--
            (1) the Federal land is--

                of a Native Village is located; or
                    (B) surrounded by--
                          (i) land that is owned by the Native 
                      Corporation; or
                          (ii) selected land that will be conveyed to 
                      the Native Corporation;

                    (A) became available after the end of the original 
                selection period;
                    (B)(i) was not selected by the Native Corporation 
                because the Federal land was subject to a competing 
                claim or entry; and
                    (ii) the competing claim or entry has lapsed; or
                    (C) was previously an unavailable Federal enclave 
                within a Native selection withdrawal area;
            (3)(A) the Secretary provides the Native Corporation with a 
        specific time period in which to decline the Federal land; and
            (B) the Native Corporation does not submit to the Secretary 
        written notice declining the land within the period established 
        under subparagraph (A); and
            (4) the State has voluntarily relinquished any valid State 
        selection or top-filing for the Federal land.

application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 1980, the Secretary 
may correct a conveyance to a Native Corporation or to the State that 
includes land described in the allotment application to exclude the 
described allotment land with the written concurrence of the Native 
Corporation or the State.
    ``(2) A written concurrence shall--
            ``(A) include a finding that the land description proposed 
        by the Secretary is acceptable; and

[[Page 118 STAT. 3588]]

            ``(B) attest that the Native Corporation or the State has 
        not--
                    ``(i) granted any third party rights or taken any 
                other action that would affect the ability of the United 
                States to convey full title under the Act of May 17, 
                1906 (34 Stat. 197, chapter 2469); and

                waste on the land.

    ``(3) On receipt of an acceptable written concurrence, the

        Native Corporation, as appropriate; and
            ``(B) issue a certificate of allotment to the allotment 
        applicant.

an allotment claim or a portion of the allotment claim agreeable to the 
applicant in satisfaction of the entire claim by tendering a valid and 
appropriate deed to the United States.
    (b) Certificate of Allotment.--If the United States determines that 
the allotment application is valid or would have been approved under 
section 905 of the Alaska National Interests Lands Conservation Act (42 
U.S.C. 1634) had the land described in the allotment application been in 
Federal ownership on December 2, 1980, and obtains title evidence 
acceptable under the Department of Justice title standards, the United 
States shall accept the deed from the Native Corporation and issue a 
certificate of allotment to the allotment applicant.
    (c) Probate Not Required.--If the Native Corporation reconveys the 
entire interest of the Native Corporation in the allotment claim of a 
deceased applicant, the United States may accept the deed and issue the 
certificate of allotment without waiting for a determination of heirs or 
the approval of a will.
    (d) No Liability.--The United States shall not be subject to 
liability under Federal or State law for the presence of any hazardous 
substance in land or an interest in land solely as a result of any 
reconveyance to, and transfer by, the United States of land or interests 
in land under this section.

than the land that the applicant originally intended to claim if--
            ``(A) the application--
                    ``(i) describes land selected by or conveyed by 
                interim conveyance or patent to a Native Corporation

                granted to a Native Corporation by the United States;

        by or conveyed by interim conveyance or patent to a Native 
        Corporation of approximately equal acreage in substitution for 
        the land described in the original application;
            ``(C) the Director of the Bureau of Land Management has not 
        adopted a final plan of survey for the final entitlement of the 
        Native Corporation or its successor in interest; and

        successor in interest provides a corporate resolution 
        authorizing reconveyance or relinquishment to the United States 
        of the land, or interest in land, described in the revised 
        application.

        been approved under section 905 of the Alaska National Interest 
        Lands Conservation Act (43 U.S.C. 1634) had the land in the 
        allotment application been in Federal ownership on December 2, 
        1980;
            ``(B) in consultation with the administering agency, that 
        the proposed revision would not create an isolated inholding 
        within a conservation system unit (as defined in section 102 of 
        the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 
        3102)); and

acceptable under Department of Justice title standards and acceptance of 
a reconveyance or relinquishment from a Native Corporation under 
paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue a Native allotment certificate 
to the applicant for the land reconveyed or relinquished by the Native 
Corporation.

    ``(B) Any allotment revised under this section shall, when allotted, 
be made subject to any easement, trail, right-of-way, or any third-party 
interest (other than a fee interest) in existence on the revised 
allotment land on the date of revision.''.

SEC. 304. COMPENSATORY <<NOTE: Records. 43 USC 1617 note.>> ACREAGE.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall adjust the acreage entitlement 
computation records for the State or an affected Native Corporation to 
account for any difference in the amount of acreage between the 
corrected description and the previous description in any conveyance 
document as a result of actions taken under section 18(d) of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act (as added by section 301) or section 18(e) 
of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (as added by section 303), or 
for other voluntary reconveyances to the United States for the purpose 
of facilitating land transfers in the State.
    (b) Limitation.--No adjustment to the acreage conveyance 
computations shall be made where the State or an affected Native

[[Page 118 STAT. 3590]]

Corporation retains a partial estate in the described allotment land.
    (c) Availability of Additional Land.--If, as a result of 
implementation under section 18(d) of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act (as added by section 301) or any voluntary reconveyance 
to facilitate a land transfer, a Village Corporation has insufficient 
remaining selections from which to receive its full entitlement under 
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the Secretary may use the 
authority and procedures available under paragraph (3) of section 22(j) 
of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1621(j)) (as added 
by section 208) to make additional land available for selection by the

reinstate a previously closed Native allotment application or to accept 
a reconstructed copy of an application claimed to have been timely filed 
with an agency of the Department of the Interior, the United States--
            ``(A) may seek voluntary reconveyance of any land described 
        in the application that is reinstated or reconstructed after the 
        date of enactment of this subsection; but

        from a current landowner.

    ``(2) A certificate of allotment that is issued for any allotment

party interests created by the State, without regard to the date on 
which the Native allotment applicant initiated use and occupancy.''.
