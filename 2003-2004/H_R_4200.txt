SEC. 242. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FUNDING OF THE ADVANCED 
            SHIPBUILDING ENTERPRISE UNDER THE NATIONAL SHIPBUILDING 
            RESEARCH PROGRAM OF THE NAVY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The budget for fiscal year 2005, as submitted to 
        Congress by the President, provides $10,300,000 for the Advanced 
        Shipbuilding Enterprise under the National Shipbuilding Research 
        Program of the Navy.
            (2) The Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise is an innovative 
        program to encourage greater efficiency in the national 
        technology and industrial base.
            (3) The leaders of the United States shipbuilding industry 
        have embraced the Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise as a

[[Page 118 STAT. 1839]]

        method for exploring and collaborating on innovation in 
        shipbuilding and ship repair that collectively benefits all 
        components of the industry.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that Congress--
                    (A) strongly supports the innovative Advanced 
                Shipbuilding Enterprise under the National Shipbuilding 
                Research Program as an enterprise between the Navy and 
                industry that has yielded new processes and techniques 
                that reduce the cost of building and repairing ships in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) is concerned that the future-years defense 
                program of the Department of Defense that was submitted 
                to Congress for fiscal year 2005 does not reflect any 
                funding for the Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise after 
                fiscal year 2005; and
            (2) that the Secretary of Defense should continue to provide 
        in the future-years defense program for funding the Advanced 
        Shipbuilding Enterprise at a sustaining level in order to 
        support additional research to further reduce the cost of 
        designing, building, and repairing ships.

        drinking water standard for perchlorate;
            (2) continue remediation activities for perchlorate 
        contamination at those sites where perchlorate contamination 
        poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health 
        and welfare and where the Department is undertaking site-
        specific remedial action as of the date of the enactment of this 
        Act;
            (3) develop a plan for the remediation of perchlorate 
        contamination resulting from the activities of the Department of 
        Defense in cases in which, notwithstanding the lack of a 
        drinking water standard for perchlorate, such contamination is 
        present in ground or surface water at levels that the Secretary 
        of Defense determines pose a hazard to human health; and
            (4) continue the process of evaluating and prioritizing 
        perchlorate contamination sites without waiting for the 
        establishment of the Federal drinking water standard for 
        perchlorate.

SEC. 588. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RETURN OF MEMBERS TO ACTIVE DUTY 
            SERVICE UPON REHABILITATION FROM SERVICE-RELATED INJURIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The generation of young people currently serving on 
        active duty in the Armed Forces, which history will record as 
        being among the greatest, has shown in remarkable numbers an 
        individual resolve to recover from injuries incurred in such 
        service and to return to active service in the Armed Forces.
            (2) Since September 11, 2001, numerous brave soldiers, 
        sailors, airmen, and Marines have incurred serious combat 
        injuries, including (as of June 2004) approximately 100 members 
        of the Armed Forces who have been fitted with artificial limbs 
        as a result of devastating injuries sustained in combat 
        overseas.
            (3) In cases involving combat-related injuries and other 
        service-related injuries, it is possible, as a result of 
        advances in technology and extensive rehabilitative services, to 
        restore to members of the Armed Forces sustaining such injuries 
        the capability to resume the performance of active military 
        service, including, in a few cases, the capability to 
        participate directly in the performance of combat missions.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a member of the Armed Forces who on the member's own 
        initiative is highly motivated to return to active duty service 
        following rehabilitation from injuries incurred in service in 
        the Armed Forces should, after appropriate medical review and 
        physical disability evaluation, be given the opportunity to 
        present the member's case for continuing to serve on active duty 
        in varied military capacities;
            (2) other than appropriate medical review and physical 
        disability evaluation, there should be no barrier in policy or 
        law to such a member having the option to return to military 
        service on active duty; and
            (3) the Secretary of Defense should develop specific 
        protocols that include options for such members to return to 
        active duty service and to be retrained to perform military 
        missions for which they are fully capable.

of, units of the Armed Force on a temporary basis to meet no-notice, or 
short-notice, operational requirements. In conducting the study, the 
Secretary shall examine a range of options, including--
            (A) a system that would embed on short notice in military

subsection (b) that the screening methods and process improvements 
developed under subsection (a)(1) should not be implemented on a test 
basis, the Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 90 days 
thereafter, notify the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives of such 
determination, together with the reasons of the Secretary for such

    ``(f) Certification Interrupted by Contingency Operation.--(1) 
Notwithstanding subsection (c), the Secretary concerned may waive the 
certification requirement under such subsection and pay monthly special 
pay or a bonus under this section to a member who--
            ``(A) is assigned to duty in connection with a contingency 
        operation;
            ``(B) is unable to schedule or complete the certification 
        required by subsection (c) because of that assignment; and
            ``(C) except for the lack of such certification, satisfies 
        the eligibility requirements for receipt of special pay under 
        subsection (a) or a bonus under subsection (b), whichever 
        applies to the member.

    ``(2) For purposes of providing an annual bonus to a member under 
the authority of this subsection, the Secretary concerned may treat the 
date on which the member was assigned to duty

[[Page 118 STAT. 1954]]

in connection with the contingency operation as equivalent to a 
certification date. In the case of a member whose certification will 
expire during such a duty assignment, the Secretary shall commence the 
next one-year certification period on the date on which the prior 
certification period expires.
    ``(3) A member who is paid special pay or a bonus under the 
authority of this subsection shall complete the certification required 
by subsection (c) for the foreign language for which the special pay or 
bonus was paid not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on 
the date on which the member is released from the assignment in 
connection with the contingency operation. The Secretary concerned may 
extend that period for a member in accordance with regulations 
prescribed under subsection (h).
    ``(4) If a member fails to obtain the required certification under 
subsection (c) before the end of the period provided under paragraph 
(3), the Secretary concerned may require the member to repay all or a 
portion of the bonus in the manner provided in subsection (g).
    ``(g) Repayment of Bonus.--(1) The Secretary concerned may require a 
member who receives a bonus under this section, but who does not satisfy 
an eligibility requirement specified in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) 
of subsection (a) for the entire certification period, to repay to the 
United States an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount 
of the bonus paid to the member as the unsatisfied portion of the 
certification period bears to the entire certification period.
    ``(2) An obligation to repay the United States imposed under 
paragraph (1) or subsection (f)(4) is for all purposes a debt owed to 
the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is 
entered for the member less than five years after the expiration of the 
certification period does not discharge the member from a debt arising 
under this paragraph. This paragraph applies to any case commenced under 
title 11 after the date of the enactment of this section.
    ``(h) Regulations.--This section shall be administered under 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense for the armed forces 
under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, by the Secretary of Homeland 
Security for the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a

                election under paragraph (1) by reason of eligibility 
                under paragraph (3)(B) shall be treated for all purposes

        that Plan is providing annuity coverage for the person's spouse 
        or a former spouse.
            (3) Limitation on eligibility for certain sbp participants 
        not affected by two-tier annuity computation.--A person is not

        Benefit Plan is to be computed under section 1451(e) of title 
        10, United States Code. However, such a person may during the 
        open enrollment period waive the right to have that annuity 
        computed under such section 1451(e). Any such election is

enrollment period. Any such election shall be made subject to the same 
conditions, and with the same opportunities for designation of 
beneficiaries and specification of base amount, that apply under the 
Survivor Benefit Plan or the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan, as the 
case may be. A person making an election under subsection (a) to provide 
a reserve-component annuity shall make a designation described in 
section 1448(e) of title 10, United States Code.
    (e) Effective Date for Elections.--Any such election shall be

    (f) Open Enrollment Period.--The open enrollment period under this 
section is the one-year period beginning on October 1, 2005.
    (g) Effect of Death of Person Making Election Within Two Years of 
Making Election.--If a person making an election under this section dies 
before the end of the two-year period beginning on the effective date of 
the election, the election is void and the amount of any reduction in 
retired pay of the person that is attributable to the election shall be 
paid in a lump sum to the person who would have been the deceased 
person's beneficiary under the voided election if the deceased person 
had died after the end of such two-year period.
    (h) Applicability of Certain Provisions of Law.--The provisions of 
sections 1449, 1453, and 1454 of title 10, United States Code, are 
applicable to a person making an election, and to an election, under 
this section in the same manner as if the election were made under the 
Survivor Benefit Plan or the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan, as the 
case may be.
    (i) Premium for Open Enrollment Election.--
            (1) Premiums to be charged.--The Secretary of Defense shall

        Survivor Benefit Plan pursuant to the election. The total amount 
        of the premiums to be paid by a person under the regulations 
        shall be equal to the sum of--
                    (A) the total amount by which the retired pay of the 
                person would have been reduced before the effective date

[[Page 118 STAT. 1964]]

                of the election if the person had elected to participate 
                in the Survivor Benefit Plan (for the same base amount 
                specified in the election) at the first opportunity that 
                was afforded the member to participate under chapter 73 
                of title 10, United States Code;
                    (B) interest on the amounts by which the retired pay 
                of the person would have been so reduced, computed from 
                the dates on which the retired pay would have been so 
                reduced at such rate or rates and according to such 
                methodology as the Secretary of Defense determines 
                reasonable; and
                    (C) any additional amount that the Secretary 
                determines necessary to protect the actuarial soundness 
                of the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund 
                against any increased risk for the fund that is 
                associated with the election.
            (2) Premiums to be credited to retirement fund.--Premiums 
        paid under the regulations under paragraph (1) shall be credited

SEC. 665. SURVEY AND ANALYSIS OF EFFECT OF EXTENDED AND FREQUENT 
            MOBILIZATION OF RESERVISTS FOR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE ON 
            RESERVIST INCOME.

    (a) Survey of Mobilized Reservists to Determine Differential Between 
Private Sector Income and Military Compensation.--(1) The Secretary of 
Defense shall conduct a survey involving members of the reserve 
components who serve, or have served, on active duty in support of a 
contingency operation at any time during the period beginning on 
September 11, 2001, and ending on September 30, 2005, to determine the 
extent to which such members sustained a reduction in monthly income 
during their period of active duty service compared to their average 
monthly civilian income during the 12 months preceding their 
mobilization.
    (2) To the extent practicable, at least 50 percent of the total 
number of members of the reserve components who have served on active 
duty in support of a contingency operation at any time during the period 
specified in paragraph (1) should be included in the survey. To 
participate in the survey, a member shall agree to make available to the 
Secretary such information as the Secretary may require to accurately 
calculate the average monthly civilian income of the member.
    (b) Calculation of Income Differential.--In the case of each member 
participating in the survey under subsection (a) whose total monthly 
military compensation during the active duty service of the member was 
less, or appeared to be less, than the average monthly civilian income 
of the member, the Secretary of Defense,

[[Page 118 STAT. 1976]]

in cooperation with the member, shall calculate the monthly active-duty 
income differential for the member.
    (c) Collection of Demographic Data.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
collect demographic data regarding each member of a reserve component 
who participates in the survey under subsection (a), including, at a 
minimum, data on the following:
            (1) Reserve component.
            (2) Unit of assignment.
            (3) Grade.
            (4) Age.
            (5) Years of service.
            (6) Sex.
            (7) Marital status.
            (8) Number of dependents.
            (9) General category of private-sector employment, as 
        determined by the Secretary, but to include an employment 
        category to cover members who are self-employed.
            (10) Military occupational specialty, including specifying 
        all surveyed members who are serving in a critical wartime 
        specialty.
            (11) Length of service on active duty during the most recent 
        mobilization.
            (12) Number of times mobilized since September 11, 2001.

    (d) Consideration of Average Monthly Reserve Service Income.--The 
Secretary of Defense shall collect data to calculate the average monthly 
reserve service income of members of the reserve components before their 
mobilization, and consider such data by grade, general category of 
military occupational specialty, and years of service. The Secretary 
shall also consider the effect that the receipt of average monthly 
reserve service income by reserve component members before mobilization 
should have on any obligation of the United States to eliminate or at 
least reduce the monthly active-duty income differential suffered by 
members serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation.
    (e) Effect of Income Loss on Retention.--The Secretary of Defense 
shall include in the survey under subsection (a) a question intended to 
solicit information from members of the reserve components participating 
in the survey regarding the likely effect that a reoccurring monthly 
active-duty income differential while serving on active duty would have 
on their decision to remain in Armed Forces.
    (f) Analysis of Survey Data.--(1) At a minimum, the Secretary of 
Defense shall determine, for each variable listed in paragraphs (2) 
through (12) of subsection (c), the number of members of the reserve 
components surveyed under subsection (a) who sustained a monthly active-
duty income differential for any month during their active duty service 
and compare and contrast that number with the number of members who did 
not experience a monthly active-duty income differential.
    (2) The Secretary shall also determine the average amount of the 
active-duty income differential by reserve component for each variable 
within the characteristics listed in paragraphs (2) through (12) of 
subsection (c).
    (g) Submission of <<NOTE: Deadlines. Reports.>> Survey Results and 
Recommendations.--(1) Not later than January 31, 2006, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to Congress and the Comptroller General a report 
containing the results of the surveys conducted under subsection

[[Page 118 STAT. 1977]]

(a), including the results of the analysis of survey data required by 
subsection (f). The Secretary shall include such recommendations as the 
Secretary considers appropriate regarding alternatives for restoring 
income lost by members of the reserve components who sustained a monthly 
active-duty income differential during their active duty service.
    (2) Not later than 90 days after receiving the report of the 
Secretary of Defense submitted under paragraph (1), the Comptroller 
General shall submit to Congress an assessment of the findings and 
recommendations of the Secretary contained in the report.

        mobilization of the member for active duty service in support of 
        a contingency operation during the period specified in 
        subsection (a)(1), divided by 12.

        services from obtaining them; and
            (5) the extent to which members of the Armed Forces and

program begins development, the defense acquisition authority 
responsible for that program shall develop a plan (to be known as a

            (2) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the

        agencies, should expand cooperation with the Government of 
        Afghanistan and international organizations involved in counter-
        drug activities to assist in providing a secure environment for 
        counter-drug personnel in Afghanistan; and
            (3) the United States, in conjunction with the Government of 
        Afghanistan and coalition partners, should undertake additional

       Subtitle D--Matters Relating to Museums and Commemorations

SEC. 1031. RECOGNITION OF THE LIBERTY MEMORIAL MUSEUM, KANSAS CITY, 
            MISSOURI, AS AMERICA'S NATIONAL WORLD WAR I MUSEUM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, 
        was built in honor of those individuals who served in World War 
        I in defense of liberty and the United States.
            (2) The Liberty Memorial Association, the nonprofit 
        organization that originally built the Liberty Memorial Museum, 
        is responsible for the finances, operations, and collections 
        management of the Liberty Memorial Museum.
            (3) The Liberty Memorial Museum is the only public museum in 
        the United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of 
        interpreting the experiences of the United States and its allies 
        in the World War I years (1914-1918), both on the battlefield 
        and on the home front.
            (4) The Liberty Memorial Museum project began after the 1918 
        Armistice through the efforts of a large-scale, grass-roots 
        civic and fundraising effort by the citizens of the Kansas City 
        metropolitan area, including veterans of World War I. After the 
        conclusion of a national architectural design competition, 
        ground was broken in 1921, construction began in 1923, and the 
        Liberty Memorial Museum was opened to the public in 1926.
            (5) In 1994, the Liberty Memorial Museum closed for a 
        massive restoration and expansion project. The restored museum 
        reopened to the public on Memorial Day in 2002 during a gala 
        rededication ceremony.
            (6) Exhibits prepared for the original museum buildings 
        presaged the dramatic, underground expansion of core exhibition 
        gallery space, with over 30,000 square feet of new interpretive 
        and educational exhibits currently in development. The new 
        exhibits, along with an expanded research library and archives, 
        will more fully utilize the many thousands of historical 
        objects, books, maps, posters, photographs, diaries, letters, 
        and reminiscences of World War I participants that are preserved 
        for posterity in the collections of the Liberty Memorial Museum. 
        The new core exhibition is scheduled to open on Veterans Day in 
        2006.
            (7) The City of Kansas City, the State of Missouri, and 
        thousands of private donors and philanthropic foundations have 
        contributed millions of dollars to first build and later restore 
        the Liberty Memorial Museum. The Liberty Memorial Museum 
        continues to receive the strong support of residents from the 
        States of Missouri and Kansas and across the United States.
            (8) Since its restoration and rededication in 2002, the 
        Liberty Memorial Museum has attracted thousands of visitors from 
        across the United States and many foreign countries.
            (9) There remains a need to preserve in a museum setting 
        evidence of the honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice of 
        those Americans who offered their services and who gave their 
        lives in defense of liberty during World War I, evidence of

[[Page 118 STAT. 2045]]

        the roles of women and African Americans during World War I, and 
        evidence of other relevant subjects.
            (10) The Liberty Memorial Museum seeks to educate a diverse 
        group of audiences through its comprehensive collection of 
        historical materials, emphasizing eyewitness accounts of the 
        participants on the battlefield and the home front and the 
        impact of World War I on individuals, then and now. The Liberty 
        Memorial Museum continues to actively acquire and preserve such 
        materials.
            (11) A great opportunity exists to use the invaluable 
        resources of the Liberty Memorial Museum to teach the ``Lessons 
        of Liberty'' to schoolchildren in the United States through on-
        site visits, classroom curriculum development, distance-learning 
        activities, and other educational initiatives.
            (12) The Liberty Memorial Museum should remain the foremost 
        museum in the United States regarding the national experience in 
        the World War I years, which people can visit to learn about 
        World War I and where the history of this monumental struggle 
        will be preserved so that current and future generations may 
        understand the role played by the United States in the 
        preservation and advancement of democracy, freedom, and liberty 
        in the early 20th century.
            (13) The work of the Liberty Memorial Museum to recognize 
        and preserve the history of the Nation's sacrifices in World War 
        I will take on added significance as the centennial observance 
        of the war approaches.
            (14) It is fitting and proper to refer to the Liberty 
        Memorial Museum as ``America's National World War I Museum''.

    (b) Congressional Recognition.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the Liberty Memorial Museum in Kansas City, 
        Missouri, including the museum's future and expanded exhibits, 
        collections, library, archives, and educational programs, as 
        ``America's National World War I Museum'';
            (2) recognizes that the continuing collection, preservation, 
        and interpretation of the historical objects and other 
        historical materials held by the Liberty Memorial Museum will 
        enhance the knowledge and understanding of the experiences of 
        the United States and its allies in the World War I years (1914-
        1918), both on the battlefield and on the home front;
            (3) commends the ongoing development and visibility of the 
        ``Lessons of Liberty'' educational outreach programs prepared by 
        the Liberty Memorial Museum for teachers and students throughout 
        the United States; and
            (4) encourages present generations of Americans to 
        understand the magnitude of World War I, how it shaped the 
        United States, other countries, and later world events, and how 
        the sacrifices made by Americans then helped preserve liberty, 
        democracy, and other founding principles of the United States 
        for generations to come.

SEC. 1082. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE RETURN TO 
            THE UNITED STATES OF THE REMAINS OF DECEASED MEMBERS OF THE 
            ARMED FORCES FROM OVERSEAS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense, since 1991, has relied on a 
        policy of no media coverage of the transfers of the remains of 
        deceased members of the Armed Forces--
                    (A) at Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany;
                    (B) at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, and the Port 
                Mortuary Facility at Dover Air Force Base; and
                    (C) at interim stops en route to the point of final 
                destination in the transfer of the remains.
            (2) The principal focus and purpose of the policy is to 
        protect the wishes and the privacy of families of deceased 
        members of the Armed Forces during their time of great loss and 
        grief and to give families and friends of the dead the privilege 
        to decide whether to allow media coverage at the member's duty 
        or home station, at the interment site, or at or in connection 
        with funeral and memorial services.
            (3) In a 1991 legal challenge to the Department of Defense 
        policy, as applied during Operation Desert Storm, the policy was 
        upheld by the United States District Court for the District of 
        Columbia, and on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals 
        for the District of Columbia in the case of JB Pictures, Inc. v. 
        Department of Defense and Donald B. Rice, Secretary of the Air 
        Force on the basis that denying the media the right to view the 
        return of remains at Dover Air Force Base does not violate the 
        first amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and of the 
        press.
            (4) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of 
        Columbia in that case cited the following two key Government 
        interests that are served by the Department of Defense policy:
                    (A) Reducing the hardship on the families and 
                friends of the war dead, who may feel obligated to 
                travel great distances to attend arrival ceremonies at 
                Dover Air Force Base if such ceremonies were held.
                    (B) Protecting the privacy of families and friends 
                of the dead, who may not want media coverage of the 
                unloading of caskets at Dover Air Force Base.
            (5) The Court also noted, in that case, that the bereaved 
        may be upset at the public display of the caskets of their loved 
        ones and that the policy gives the family the right to

[[Page 118 STAT. 2060]]

        grant or deny access to the media at memorial or funeral 
        services at the home base and that the policy is consistent in 
        its concern for families.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense policy regarding no media coverage of the transfer 
of the remains of deceased members of the Armed Forces--
            (1) appropriately protects the privacy of the families and 
        friends of the deceased; and
            (2) is consistent with United States constitutional 
        guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

SEC. 1083. TRANSFER OF HISTORIC F3A-1 BREWSTER CORSAIR AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Authority to Convey.--The Secretary of the Navy may convey,

Number 04634). The conveyance shall be made by means of a deed of gift.
    (b) Condition of Aircraft.--The aircraft shall be conveyed under 
subsection (a) in its current unflyable, ``as is'' condition. The 
Secretary is not required to repair or alter the condition of the 
aircraft before conveying ownership of the aircraft.

the aircraft under subsection (a) shall be made at no cost to the United 
States. Any costs associated with the conveyance and costs of operation

            INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Interagency Fire Center does not possess an 
        adequate number of aircraft for use in aerial firefighting, and 
        personnel at the Center rely on military aircraft to provide 
        such firefighting services.
            (2) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States for the National Interagency Fire Center to acquire 
        aircraft for use in aerial firefighting so that the military 
        aircraft made available for aerial firefighting will instead be 
        available for use by the Armed Forces.

    (b) Authority To Purchase Aerial Firefighting Equipment.--(1) The 
Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to purchase 10 aircraft, as 
described in paragraph (2), for the National Interagency Fire Center for 
use in aerial firefighting.
    (2) The aircraft referred to in paragraph (1) shall be aircraft that 
are--
            (A) specifically designed and built for aerial firefighting;
            (B) certified by the Chief of the Forest Service as suited 
        for conditions commonly experienced in aerial firefighting 
        operations carried out in the United States, including Alaska; 
        and

[[Page 118 STAT. 2066]]

            (C) manufactured in a manner that is consistent with the 
        recommendations for aircraft used in aerial firefighting 
        contained in--
                    (i) the Blue Ribbon Panel Report to the Chief of the 
                Forest Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land 
                Management dated December 2002; and
                    (ii) the Safety Recommendation of the Chairman of 
                the National Transportation Safety Board related to 
                aircraft used in aerial firefighting dated April 23, 
                2004.

                      sources; and
                          ``(ii) the Secretary shall consider as meeting 
                      the requirements of this subparagraph, unless the 
                      Secretary determines, based on a preponderance of

SEC. 1091. <<NOTE: 10 USC 801 note.>> SENSE OF CONGRESS AND POLICY 
            CONCERNING PERSONS DETAINED BY THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the abuses inflicted upon detainees at the Abu Ghraib 
        prison in Baghdad, Iraq, are inconsistent with the 
        professionalism, dedication, standards, and training required of 
        individuals who serve in the United States Armed Forces;
            (2) the vast majority of members of the Armed Forces have 
        upheld the highest possible standards of professionalism and 
        morality in the face of illegal tactics and terrorist attacks 
        and attempts on their lives;
            (3) the abuse of persons in United States custody in Iraq is 
        appropriately condemned and deplored by the American people;
            (4) the Armed Forces are moving swiftly and decisively to 
        identify, try, and, if found guilty, punish persons who 
        perpetrated such abuse;
            (5) the Department of Defense and appropriate military 
        authorities must continue to undertake corrective action, as 
        appropriate, to address chain-of-command deficiencies and the 
        systemic deficiencies identified in the incidents in question;
            (6) the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United 
        States and the applicable guidance and regulations of the United 
        States Government prohibit the torture or cruel, inhuman, or 
        degrading treatment of foreign prisoners held in custody by the 
        United States;

[[Page 118 STAT. 2069]]

            (7) the alleged crimes of a handful of individuals should 
        not detract from the commendable sacrifices of over 300,000 
        members of the Armed Forces who have served, or who are serving, 
        in Operation Iraqi Freedom; and
            (8) no detainee shall be subject to torture or cruel, 
        inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited 
        by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of United States.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) ensure that no detainee shall be subject to torture or 
        cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is 
        prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United 
        States;
            (2) investigate and prosecute, as appropriate, all alleged 
        instances of unlawful treatment of detainees in a manner 
        consistent with the international obligations, laws, or policies 
        of the United States;
            (3) ensure that all personnel of the United States 
        Government understand their obligations in both wartime and 
        peacetime to comply with the legal prohibitions against torture, 
        cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees in the 
        custody of the United States;
            (4) ensure that, in a case in which there is doubt as to 
        whether a detainee is entitled to prisoner of war status under 
        the Geneva Conventions, such detainee receives the protections 
        accorded to prisoners of war until the detainee's status is 
        determined by a competent tribunal; and
            (5) expeditiously process and, if appropriate, prosecute 
        detainees in the custody of the United States, including those 
        in the custody of the United States Armed Forces at Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba.

    (c) Detainees.--For purposes of this section, the term ``detainee'' 
means a person in the custody or under the physical control of the 
United States as a result of armed conflict.

                Conventions; and
                    (B) establishes standard operating procedures for 
                the treatment of detainees.

[[Page 118 STAT. 2070]]

            (2) Ensuring that each Department of Defense contract in 
        which contract personnel in the course of their duties interact 
        with individuals detained by the Department of Defense on behalf

        contract personnel have received training, and documented 
        acknowledgment of receiving training, regarding the 
        international obligations and laws of the United States 
        applicable to the detention of personnel.
            (3) Providing all detainees with information, in their own 
        language, of the applicable protections afforded under the 
        Geneva Conventions.
            (4) Conducting periodic unannounced and announced 
        inspections of detention facilities in order to provide 
        continued oversight of interrogation and detention operations.
            (5) Ensuring that, to the maximum extent practicable, 
        detainees and detention facility personnel of a different gender 
        are not alone together.

    (c) Secretary of Defense Certification.--The Secretary of Defense 
shall certify that all Federal employees and civilian contractors 
engaged in the handling or interrogation of individuals detained by the 
Department of Defense on behalf of the United States Government have 
fulfilled an annual training requirement on the law of war, the Geneva 
Conventions, and the obligations of the United States under 
international law.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The need to act in accord with one's conscience, risking 
        one's career and even the esteem of one's colleagues by pursuing 
        what is right is especially important today.
            (2) While the Department of Defense investigates the 
        horrific abuses in American detention facilities in Iraq, the 
        Nation should bear in mind that the abuses were only brought to 
        light because of the courage of an American soldier.
            (3) By alerting his superiors to abuses at Abu Ghraib prison 
        in Iraq, Army Specialist Joseph Darby demonstrated the courage 
        to speak out and do what is right for his country.
            (4) Such an action is especially important in light of the 
        many challenges facing the country.
            (5) Specialist Darby deserves the Nation's thanks for 
        speaking up and for standing up for what is right.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should make every protection 
        available to Army Specialist Joseph Darby and others who 
        demonstrate such courage; and
            (2) Specialist Darby should be commended appropriately by 
        the Secretary of the Army.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Certain countries are seeking to acquire ballistic 
        missiles and related technologies that could be used to attack 
        the United States or place at risk United States interests, 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces, and allies of the United 
        States and other friendly foreign countries.
            (2) Certain countries continue to actively transfer or sell 
        ballistic missile technologies in contravention of standards of 
        behavior established by the United States and allies of the 
        United States and other friendly foreign countries.
            (3) The spread of ballistic missiles and related 
        technologies worldwide has been slowed by a combination of 
        national and international export controls, forward-looking 
        diplomacy, and multilateral interdiction activities to restrict 
        the development and transfer of such missiles and technologies.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to develop, 
support, and strengthen international accords and other cooperative 
efforts to curtail the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related 
technologies which could threaten the territory of the United States, 
allies of the United States and other friendly foreign countries,

[[Page 118 STAT. 2088]]

and deployed members of the Armed Forces of the United States with 
weapons of mass destruction.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should vigorously pursue foreign 
        policy initiatives aimed at eliminating, reducing, or retarding 
        the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related 
        technologies; and
            (2) the United States and the international community should 
        continue to support and strengthen established international 
        accords and other cooperative efforts, including United Nations 
        Security Council Resolution 1540 (April 28, 2004) and the

        eliminate, reduce, or retard the proliferation of ballistic 
        missiles and related technologies.

        of Mass Destruction;
            (2) ensure that the Russian Federation remains the primary 
        focus of the Partnership, but also seek to fund, through the 
        Partnership, efforts in other countries that need assistance to 
        secure or dismantle their own potentially vulnerable weapons or 
        materials;
            (3) develop for the Partnership clear program goals;
            (4) develop for the Partnership transparent project 
        prioritization and planning;
            (5) develop for the Partnership project implementation 
        milestones under periodic review;
            (6) develop under the Partnership agreements between 
        partners for project implementation; and

            (2) Approximately 650,000 of those students are currently 
        attending public elementary or secondary schools in the United 
        States.
            (3) Changes to the military family housing policies of the 
        military departments affect both military housing requirements 
        and the number of dependent children living on military 
        installations in the United States.
            (4) Proposed restationing of units of the Armed Forces 
        worldwide, including the return of a significant number of 
        members of the Armed Forces stationed overseas to the United 
        States and the Army proposal to modify its force structure to 
        establish so-called units of action, will increase military 
        housing requirements at military installations in the United 
        States and may result in the need for additional educational 
        facilities at such installations and in the adjacent 
        communities.
            (5) To help provide sufficient housing for members of the 
        Armed Forces and their families, the Secretaries of the military 
        departments intend to continue to use the authorities provided 
        in subchapter IV of chapter 169 of title 10, United States Code, 
        to carry out privatization initiatives that will improve or 
        replace an additional 120,000 military family housing units in 
        the United States.
            (6) The Secretaries of the military departments may include 
        the construction of school facilities as one of the ancillary 
        supporting facilities authorized as part of a privatization 
        initiative carried out under such subchapter.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense should--
            (1) consider the effects that changes in force structure and 
        overseas stationing arrangements will have on--
                    (A) military housing requirements at specific 
                military installations in the United States;
                    (B) the number of school-aged military dependents at 
                those installations; and
                    (C) the need for additional educational facilities 
                to serve such dependents; and
            (2) consult with local communities and local educational 
        agencies about the best ways to address such changing housing 
        requirements and satisfy the need for additional educational 
        facilities, including using the authority of subchapter IV of 
        chapter 169 of title 10, United States Code, to include the 
        construction of educational facilities as one of the ancillary 
        supporting facilities authorized as part of military 
        privatization housing initiatives.

            (1) for each facility for which such report found that 
        insufficient information was available to determine whether 
        significant residual contamination was present, determine 
        whether significant residual contamination was present;
            (2) for each facility for which such report found that 
        significant residual contamination remained present as of the 
        date of the report, determine the date on which such 
        contamination ceased to be present;
            (3) for each facility for which such report found that 
        significant residual contamination was present but for which the 
        Director has been unable to determine the extent to which such 
        contamination is attributable to atomic weapons-related 
        activities, identify the specific dates of coverage attributable 
        to such activities and, in so identifying, presume that such 
        contamination is attributable to such activities until there is 
        evidence of decontamination of residual contamination identified 
        with atomic weapons-related activities;
            (4) for each facility for which such report found 
        significant residual contamination, determine whether it is at 
        least as likely as not that such contamination could have caused 
        an employee who was employed at such facility only during the 
        residual contamination period to contract a cancer or beryllium 
        illness compensable under subtitle B of the Energy Employees 
        Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000; and
            (5) if new information that pertains to the report has been 
        made available to the Director since that report was submitted, 
        identify and describe such information.

    (c) Publication.--The <<NOTE: Federal 
Register, publication.>> Director shall ensure that the report referred 
to in subsection (a) is published in the Federal Register not later than 
15 days after being released.

SEC. 3170. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RESOURCE CENTER FOR ENERGY EMPLOYEES 
            UNDER ENERGY EMPLOYEE OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION 
            PROGRAM IN WESTERN NEW YORK AND WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) New York has 36 current or former Department of Energy 
        facilities involved in nuclear weapons production-related 
        activities statewide, mostly atomic weapons employer facilities, 
        and 14 such facilities in western New York. Despite having one 
        of the greatest concentrations of such facilities in the United 
        States, western New York, and abutting areas of Pennsylvania, 
        continue to be severely underserved by the Energy Employees 
        Occupational Illness Compensation Program under the Energy 
        Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 
        (title XXXVI of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense

[[Page 118 STAT. 2192]]

        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
        Public Law 106-398); 42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.).
            (2) The establishment of a permanent resource center in 
        western New York would represent a substantial step toward 
        improving services under the Energy Employees Occupational 
        Illness Compensation Program for energy employees in this 
        region.
            (3) The number of claims submitted to the Department under 
        subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
        Compensation Program Act of 2000 from the western New York 
        region, including western Pennsylvania, exceeds the number of 
        such claims filed at resource centers in Hanford, Washington, 
        Portsmouth, Ohio, Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Nevada Test Site, 
        Nevada, the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, Colorado, 
        the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho, and the 
        Amchitka Test Site, Alaska.
            (4) Energy employees in the western New York region, 
        including western Pennsylvania, deserve assistance under 
        subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
        Compensation Program Act of 2000 commensurate with the 
        assistance provided energy employees at other locations in the 
        United States.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Labor should--
            (1) review the availability of assistance under subtitle B 
        of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
        Program Act of 2000 for energy employees in the western New York 
        region, including western Pennsylvania; and
            (2) recommend a location in that region for a resource 
        center to provide such assistance to such energy employees.
