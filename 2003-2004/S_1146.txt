SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in 1949, the United States assumed jurisdiction over 
        more than 150,000 prime acres on the Fort Berthold Indian 
        Reservation, North Dakota, for the construction of the Garrison 
        Dam and Reservoir;
            (2) the reservoir flooded and destroyed vital infrastructure 
        on the reservation, including a hospital of the Indian Health 
        Service;
            (3) the United States made a commitment to the Three 
        Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation to 
        replace the lost infrastructure;
            (4) on May 10, 1985, the Secretary of the Interior 
        established the Garrison Unit Joint Tribal Advisory Committee to 
        examine the effects of the Garrison Dam and Reservoir on the 
        Fort Berthold Indian Reservation;
            (5) the final report of the Committee issued on May 23, 
        1986, acknowledged the obligation of the Federal Government to 
        replace the infrastructure destroyed by the Federal action;
            (6) the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate--
                    (A) acknowledged the recommendations of the final 
                report of the Committee in Senate Report No. 102-250; 
                and
                    (B) stated that every effort should be made by the 
                Administration and Congress to provide additional 
                Federal funding to replace the lost infrastructure; and
            (7) on August 30, 2001, the Chairman of the Three Affiliated 
        Tribes testified before the Committee on Indian Affairs of the 
        Senate that the promise to replace the lost infrastructure, 
        particularly the hospital, still had not been kept.
