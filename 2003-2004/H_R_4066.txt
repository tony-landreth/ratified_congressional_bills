Land Exchange Act of 2004''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) By provision 64 of the agreement between the United 
        States and the Choctaws and Chickasaws dated March 21, 1902 (32 
        Stat. 641, 655-56), approved July 1, 1902, 640 acres of property 
        were ceded to the United States for the purpose of creating 
        Sulphur Springs Reservation, later known as Platt National Park, 
        to protect water and other resources and provide public access.
            (2) In 1976, Platt National Park, the Arbuckle Recreation 
        Area, and additional lands were combined to create Chickasaw 
        National Recreation Area to protect and expand water and other 
        resources as well as to memorialize the history and culture of 
        the Chickasaw Nation.
            (3) More recently, the Chickasaw Nation has expressed 
        interest in establishing a cultural center inside or adjacent to 
        the park.
            (4) The Chickasaw National Recreation Area's Final Amendment 
        to the General Management Plan (1994) found that the best 
        location for a proposed Chickasaw Nation Cultural Center is 
        within the Recreation Area's existing boundary and that the 
        selected cultural center site should be conveyed to the 
        Chickasaw Nation in exchange for land of equal value.
            (5) The land selected to be conveyed to the Chickasaw Nation 
        holds significant historical and cultural connections to the 
        people of the Chickasaw Nation.
            (6) The City of Sulphur, Oklahoma, is a key partner in this 
        land exchange through its donation of land to the Chickasaw 
        Nation for the purpose of exchange with the United States.
            (7) The City of Sulphur, Oklahoma, has conveyed fee simple 
        title to the non-Federal land described as Tract 102-26 to the 
        Chickasaw Nation by Warranty Deed.
            (8) The National Park Service, the Chickasaw Nation, and the 
        City of Sulphur, Oklahoma, have signed a preliminary

[[Page 118 STAT. 2240]]

        agreement to effect a land exchange for the purpose of the 
        construction of a cultural center.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize, direct,
