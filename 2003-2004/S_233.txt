SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Coltsville Study Act of 2003''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Hartford, <<NOTE: Colt Manufacturing 
        Company.>> Connecticut, home to Colt Manufacturing Company 
        (referred to in this Act as ``Colt''), played a major role in 
        the Industrial Revolution;
            (2) Samuel Colt, founder of Colt, and his wife, Elizabeth 
        Colt, inspired Coltsville, a community in the State of 
        Connecticut that flourished during the Industrial Revolution and 
        included Victorian mansions, an open green area, botanical 
        gardens, and a deer park;
            (3) the residence of Samuel and Elizabeth Colt in Hartford, 
        Connecticut, known as ``Armsmear'', is a national historic 
        landmark, and the distinctive Colt factory is a prominent 
        feature of the Hartford, Connecticut, skyline;
            (4) the Colt legacy is not only about firearms, but also 
        about industrial innovation and the development of technology 
        that would change the way of life in the United States, 
        including--
                    (A) the development of telegraph technology; and
                    (B) advancements in jet engine technology by Francis 
                Pratt and Amos Whitney, who served as apprentices at 
                Colt;
            (5) Coltsville--
                    (A) set the standard for excellence during the 
                Industrial Revolution; and
                    (B) continues to prove significant--
                          (i) as a place in which people of the United 
                      States can learn about that important period in 
                      history; and
                          (ii) by reason of the close proximity of 
                      Coltsville to the Mark Twain House, Trinity 
                      College, Old North Cemetery, and many historic 
                      homesteads and architecturally renowned buildings;
            (6) in 1998, the National Park Service conducted a special 
        resource reconnaissance study of the Connecticut River Valley to 
        evaluate the significance of precision manufacturing sites; and

[[Page 117 STAT. 1164]]

            (7) the report on the study stated that--
                    (A) no other region of the United States contains an 
                equal concentration of resources relating to the 
                precision manufacturing theme that began with firearms 
                production;
                    (B) properties relating to precision manufacturing 
                encompass more than merely factories; and
                    (C) further study, which should be undertaken, may 
                recommend inclusion of churches and other social 
                institutions.
