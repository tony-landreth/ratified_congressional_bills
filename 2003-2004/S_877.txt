To regulate interstate commerce by imposing limitations and penalties on 
   the transmission of unsolicited commercial electronic mail via the 
             Internet. <<NOTE: Dec. 16, 2003 -  [S. 877]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Controlling the 
Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.>> 

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 15 USC 7701 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Controlling the Assault of Non-
Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003'', or the ``CAN-SPAM Act 
of 2003''.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 15 USC 7701.>> CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and 
        popular means of communication, relied on by millions of 
        Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial purposes. 
        Its low cost and global reach make it extremely convenient and 
        efficient, and offer unique opportunities for the development 
        and growth of frictionless commerce.
            (2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are 
        threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of 
        unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited commercial 
        electronic mail is currently estimated to account for over half 
        of all electronic mail traffic, up from an estimated 7 percent 
        in 2001, and the volume continues to rise. Most of these 
        messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.
            (3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept 
        such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, or 
        for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding such 
        mail, or for both.
            (4) The receipt of a large number of unwanted messages also 
        decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates a risk 
        that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial and 
        noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded amidst the 
        larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing the 
        reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the recipient.
            (5) Some commercial electronic mail contains material that 
        many recipients may consider vulgar or pornographic in nature.
            (6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet 
        access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit 
        institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a 
        finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and

[[Page 117 STAT. 2700]]

        institutions can handle without further investment in 
        infrastructure.
            (7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        purposefully disguise the source of such mail.
            (8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail 
        purposefully include misleading information in the messages' 
        subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the 
        messages.
            (9) While some senders of commercial electronic mail 
        messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to 
        reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of commercial electronic mail 
        from such senders in the future, other senders provide no such 
        ``opt-out'' mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests of 
        recipients not to receive electronic mail from such senders in 
        the future, or both.
            (10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic 
        mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of electronic 
        mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet websites or 
        online services where users must post their addresses in order 
        to make full use of the website or service.
            (11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to 
        regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, but 
        these statutes impose different standards and requirements. As a 
        result, they do not appear to have been successful in addressing 
        the problems associated with unsolicited commercial electronic 
        mail, in part because, since an electronic mail address does not 
        specify a geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for 
        law-abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate 
        statutes they are required to comply.
            (12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse 
        of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be solved by 
        Federal legislation alone. The development and adoption of 
        technological approaches and the pursuit of cooperative efforts 
        with other countries will be necessary as well.

    (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the basis of 
the findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that--
            (1) there is a substantial government interest in regulation 
        of commercial electronic mail on a nationwide basis;
            (2) senders of commercial electronic mail should not mislead 
        recipients as to the source or content of such mail; and
            (3) recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right to 
        decline to receive additional commercial electronic mail from 
        the same source.

                initiative; and
                    (B) if the message is from a party other than the 
                party to which the recipient communicated such consent, 
                the recipient was given clear and conspicuous notice at

[[Page 117 STAT. 2701]]

                the time the consent was communicated that the 
                recipient's electronic mail address could be transferred 
                to such other party for the purpose of initiating 
                commercial electronic mail messages.

                treated as a commercial electronic mail message for 
                purposes of this Act if the contents or circumstances of 
                the message indicate a primary purpose other than

                throughout the message as that particular line of 
                business or division rather than as the entity of which 
                such line of business or division is a part, then the 
                line of business or the division shall be treated as the

                      information with respect to a commercial product 
                      or service used or purchased by the recipient;

                                to,
                      a subscription, membership, account, loan, or 
                      comparable ongoing commercial relationship 
                      involving the ongoing purchase or use by the 
                      recipient of products or services offered by the 
                      sender;
                          (iv) to provide information directly related 
                      to an employment relationship or related benefit 
                      plan in which the recipient is currently involved, 
                      participating, or enrolled; or
                          (v) to deliver goods or services, including 
                      product updates or upgrades, that the recipient is 
                      entitled to receive under the terms of a 
                      transaction that the recipient has previously 
                      agreed to enter into with the sender.
                    (B) Modification of definition.--The Commission by 
                regulation pursuant to section 13 may modify the 
                definition in subparagraph (A) to expand or contract the 
                categories of messages that are treated as transactional 
                or relationship messages for purposes of this Act to the 
                extent that such modification is necessary to 
                accommodate changes in electronic mail technology or 
                practices and accomplish the purposes of this Act.

        message, an Internet access service processing the message on 
        behalf of a recipient, a person alleging a violation of this 
        section, or a law enforcement agency to identify, locate, or

           mail.''.

    (b) United <<NOTE: 28 USC 994 note.>> States Sentencing 
Commission.--
            (1) Directive.--Pursuant to its authority under section 
        994(p) of title 28, United States Code, and in accordance with 
        this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall 
        review and, as appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines and 
        policy statements to provide appropriate penalties for 
        violations of section 1037 of title 18, United States Code, as 
        added by this section, and other offenses that may be 
        facilitated by the sending of large quantities of unsolicited 
        electronic mail.
            (2) Requirements.--In carrying out this subsection, the 
        Sentencing Commission shall consider providing sentencing 
        enhancements for--
                    (A) those convicted under section 1037 of title 18, 
                United States Code, who--
                          (i) obtained electronic mail addresses through 
                      improper means, including--
                                    (I) harvesting electronic mail 
                                addresses of the users of a website, 
                                proprietary service, or other online 
                                public forum operated by another person, 
                                without the authorization of such 
                                person; and
                                    (II) randomly generating electronic 
                                mail addresses by computer; or
                          (ii) knew that the commercial electronic mail 
                      messages involved in the offense contained or 
                      advertised an Internet domain for which the 
                      registrant of the domain had provided false 
                      registration information; and

[[Page 117 STAT. 2706]]

                    (B) those convicted of other offenses, including 
                offenses involving fraud, identity theft, obscenity, 
                child pornography, and the sexual exploitation of 
                children, if such offenses involved the sending of large 
                quantities of electronic mail.

    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Spam has become the method of choice for those who 
        distribute pornography, perpetrate fraudulent schemes, and 
        introduce viruses, worms, and Trojan horses into personal and 
        business computer systems; and
            (2) the Department of Justice should use all existing law 
        enforcement tools to investigate and prosecute those who send 
        bulk commercial e-mail to facilitate the commission of Federal 
        crimes, including the tools contained in chapters 47 and 63 of 
        title 18, United States Code (relating to fraud and false 
        statements); chapter 71 of title 18, United States Code 
        (relating to obscenity); chapter 110 of title 18, United States 
        Code (relating to the sexual exploitation of children); and

SEC. 5. OTHER <<NOTE: 15 USC 7704.>> PROTECTIONS FOR USERS OF 
                    COMMERCIAL ELECTRONIC MAIL.

    (a) Requirements for Transmission of Messages.--
            (1) Prohibition of false or misleading transmission 
        information.--It is unlawful for any person to initiate the 
        transmission, to a protected computer, of a commercial 
        electronic mail message, or a transactional or relationship 
        message, that contains, or is accompanied by, header information 
        that is materially false or materially misleading. For purposes 
        of this paragraph--
                    (A) header information that is technically accurate 
                but includes an originating electronic mail address, 
                domain name, or Internet Protocol address the access to 
                which for purposes of initiating the message was 
                obtained by means of false or fraudulent pretenses or 
                representations shall be considered materially 
                misleading;
                    (B) a ``from'' line (the line identifying or 
                purporting to identify a person initiating the message) 
                that accurately identifies any person who initiated the 
                message shall not be considered materially false or 
                materially misleading; and
                    (C) header information shall be considered 
                materially misleading if it fails to identify accurately 
                a protected computer used to initiate the message 
                because the person initiating the message knowingly uses 
                another protected computer to relay or retransmit the 
                message for purposes of disguising its origin.
            (2) Prohibition of deceptive subject headings.--It is 
        unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a 
        protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message if 
        such person has actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on 
        the basis of objective circumstances, that a subject heading of 
        the message would be likely to mislead a recipient, acting 
        reasonably under the circumstances, about a material fact

[[Page 117 STAT. 2707]]

        regarding the contents or subject matter of the message 
        (consistent with the criteria used in enforcement of section 5 
        of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45)).
            (3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in 
        commercial electronic mail.--
                    (A) In general.--It is unlawful for any person to 
                initiate the transmission to a protected computer of a 
                commercial electronic mail message that does not contain 
                a functioning return electronic mail address or other 
                Internet-based mechanism, clearly and conspicuously 
                displayed, that--
                          (i) a recipient may use to submit, in a manner 
                      specified in the message, a reply electronic mail 
                      message or other form of Internet-based 
                      communication requesting not to receive future 
                      commercial electronic mail messages from that 
                      sender at the electronic mail address where the 
                      message was received; and
                          (ii) remains capable of receiving such 
                      messages or communications for no less than 30 
                      days after the transmission of the original 
                      message.
                    (B) More detailed options possible.--The person 
                initiating a commercial electronic mail message may 
                comply with subparagraph (A)(i) by providing the 
                recipient a list or menu from which the recipient may 
                choose the specific types of commercial electronic mail 
                messages the recipient wants to receive or does not want 
                to receive from the sender, if the list or menu includes 
                an option under which the recipient may choose not to 
                receive any commercial electronic mail messages from the 
                sender.
                    (C) Temporary inability to receive messages or 
                process requests.--A return electronic mail address or 
                other mechanism does not fail to satisfy the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A) if it is unexpectedly 
                and temporarily unable to receive messages or process 
                requests due to a technical problem beyond the control 
                of the sender if the problem is corrected within a 
                reasonable time period.
            (4) Prohibition of transmission of commercial electronic 
        mail after objection.--
                    (A) In general.--If a recipient makes a request 
                using a mechanism provided pursuant to paragraph (3) not 
                to receive some or any commercial electronic mail 
                messages from such sender, then it is unlawful--
                          (i) for the sender to initiate the 
                      transmission to the recipient, more than 10 
                      business days after the receipt of such request, 
                      of a commercial electronic mail message that falls 
                      within the scope of the request;
                          (ii) for any person acting on behalf of the 
                      sender to initiate the transmission to the 
                      recipient, more than 10 business days after the 
                      receipt of such request, of a commercial 
                      electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or 
                      knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective 
                      circumstances, that such message falls within the 
                      scope of the request;
                          (iii) for any person acting on behalf of the 
                      sender to assist in initiating the transmission to 
                      the recipient, through the provision or selection 
                      of addresses to which the message will be sent, of 
                      a commercial electronic

[[Page 117 STAT. 2708]]

                      mail message with actual knowledge, or knowledge 
                      fairly implied on the basis of objective 
                      circumstances, that such message would violate 
                      clause (i) or (ii); or
                          (iv) for the sender, or any other person who 
                      knows that the recipient has made such a request, 
                      to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise transfer or 
                      release the electronic mail address of the 
                      recipient (including through any transaction or 
                      other transfer involving mailing lists bearing the 
                      electronic mail address of the recipient) for any 
                      purpose other than compliance with this Act or 
                      other provision of law.
                    (B) Subsequent affirmative consent.--A prohibition 
                in subparagraph (A) does not apply if there is 
                affirmative consent by the recipient subsequent to the 
                request under subparagraph (A).
            (5) Inclusion of identifier, opt-out, and physical address 
        in commercial electronic mail.--(A) It is unlawful for any 
        person to initiate the transmission of any commercial electronic 
        mail message to a protected computer unless the message 
        provides--
                    (i) clear and conspicuous identification that the 
                message is an advertisement or solicitation;
                    (ii) clear and conspicuous notice of the opportunity 
                under paragraph (3) to decline to receive further 
                commercial electronic mail messages from the sender; and
                    (iii) a valid physical postal address of the sender.
            (B) Subparagraph (A)(i) does not apply to the transmission 
        of a commercial electronic mail message if the recipient has 
        given prior affirmative consent to receipt of the message.
            (6) Materially.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the term 
        ``materially'', when used with respect to false or misleading 
        header information, includes the alteration or concealment of 
        header information in a manner that would impair the ability of 
        an Internet access service processing the message on behalf of a 
        recipient, a person alleging a violation of this section, or a 
        law enforcement agency to identify, locate, or respond to a 
        person who initiated the electronic mail message or to 
        investigate the alleged violation, or the ability of a recipient 
        of the message to respond to a person who initiated the 
        electronic message.

    (b) Aggravated Violations Relating to Commercial Electronic Mail.--
            (1) Address harvesting and dictionary attacks.--
                    (A) In general.--It is unlawful for any person to 
                initiate the transmission, to a protected computer, of a 
                commercial electronic mail message that is unlawful 
                under subsection (a), or to assist in the origination of 
                such message through the provision or selection of 
                addresses to which the message will be transmitted, if 
                such person had actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly 
                implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that--
                          (i) the electronic mail address of the 
                      recipient was obtained using an automated means 
                      from an Internet website or proprietary online 
                      service operated by another person, and such 
                      website or online service included, at the time 
                      the address was obtained, a notice stating that 
                      the operator of such website or online

[[Page 117 STAT. 2709]]

                      service will not give, sell, or otherwise transfer 
                      addresses maintained by such website or online 
                      service to any other party for the purposes of 
                      initiating, or enabling others to initiate, 
                      electronic mail messages; or
                          (ii) the electronic mail address of the 
                      recipient was obtained using an automated means 
                      that generates possible electronic mail addresses 
                      by combining names, letters, or numbers into 
                      numerous permutations.
                    (B) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this paragraph creates 
                an ownership or proprietary interest in such electronic 
                mail addresses.
            (2) Automated creation of multiple electronic mail 
        accounts.--It is unlawful for any person to use scripts or other 
        automated means to register for multiple electronic mail 
        accounts or online user accounts from which to transmit to a 
        protected computer, or enable another person to transmit to a 
        protected computer, a commercial electronic mail message that is 
        unlawful under subsection (a).
            (3) Relay or retransmission through unauthorized access.--It 
        is unlawful for any person knowingly to relay or retransmit a 
        commercial electronic mail message that is unlawful under 
        subsection (a) from a protected computer or computer network 
        that such person has accessed without authorization.

    (c) Supplementary Rulemaking Authority.--The Commission shall by 
regulation, pursuant to section 13--
            (1) modify the 10-business-day period under subsection 
        (a)(4)(A) or subsection (a)(4)(B), or both, if the Commission 
        determines that a different period would be more reasonable 
        after taking into account--
                    (A) the purposes of subsection (a);
                    (B) the interests of recipients of commercial 
                electronic mail; and
                    (C) the burdens imposed on senders of lawful 
                commercial electronic mail; and
            (2) specify additional activities or practices to which 
        subsection (b) applies if the Commission determines that those 
        activities or practices are contributing substantially to the 
        proliferation of commercial electronic mail messages that are 
        unlawful under subsection (a).

    (d) Requirement To Place Warning Labels on Commercial Electronic 
Mail Containing Sexually Oriented Material.--
            (1) In general.--No person may initiate in or affecting 
        interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected computer, 
        of any commercial electronic mail message that includes sexually 
        oriented material and--
                    (A) fail to include in subject heading for the 
                electronic mail message the marks or notices prescribed 
                by the Commission under this subsection; or
                    (B) fail to provide that the matter in the message 
                that is initially viewable to the recipient, when the 
                message is opened by any recipient and absent any 
                further actions by the recipient, includes only--
                          (i) to the extent required or authorized 
                      pursuant to paragraph (2), any such marks or 
                      notices;

[[Page 117 STAT. 2710]]

                          (ii) the information required to be included 
                      in the message pursuant to subsection (a)(5); and
                          (iii) instructions on how to access, or a 
                      mechanism to access, the sexually oriented 
                      material.
            (2) Prior affirmative consent.--Paragraph (1) does not apply 
        to the transmission of an electronic mail message if the 
        recipient has given prior affirmative consent to receipt of the 
        message.
            (3) Prescription <<NOTE: Deadline.>> of marks and notices.--
        Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this

                under subparagraph (A), the court may consider whether--
                          (i) the defendant has established and 
                      implemented, with due care, commercially 
                      reasonable practices and procedures designed to 
                      effectively prevent such violations; or
                          (ii) the violation occurred despite 
                      commercially reasonable efforts to maintain 
                      compliance with the practices and procedures to 
                      which reference is made in clause (i).
            (4) Attorney fees.--In any action brought pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the court may, in its discretion, require an 
        undertaking for the payment of the costs of such action, and 
        assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, 
        against any party.

    (a) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted

with subsection (c)--
            (1) provide subscribers to commercial mobile services the 
        ability to avoid receiving mobile service commercial messages 
        unless the subscriber has provided express prior authorization 
        to the sender, except as provided in paragraph (3);
            (2) allow recipients of mobile service commercial messages 
        to indicate electronically a desire not to receive future mobile 
        service commercial messages from the sender;
            (3) take into consideration, in determining whether to 
        subject providers of commercial mobile services to paragraph 
        (1), the relationship that exists between providers of such 
        services and their subscribers, but if the Commission determines 
        that such providers should not be subject to paragraph (1), the 
        rules shall require such providers, in addition to complying 
        with the other provisions of this Act, to allow subscribers to 
        indicate a desire not to receive future mobile service 
        commercial messages from the provider--
                    (A) at the time of subscribing to such service; and
                    (B) in any billing mechanism; and
            (4) determine how a sender of mobile service commercial 
        messages may comply with the provisions of this Act, considering 
        the unique technical aspects, including the functional and 
        character limitations, of devices that receive such messages.

    (c) Other Factors Considered.--The Federal Communications Commission 
shall consider the ability of a sender of a commercial electronic mail 
message to reasonably determine that the message is a mobile service 
commercial message.
    (d) Mobile Service Commercial Message Defined.--In this section, the 
term ``mobile service commercial message'' means a commercial electronic 
mail message that is transmitted directly to a wireless device that is

332(d))) in connection with such service.
