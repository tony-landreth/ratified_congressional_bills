                of such Code as a retirement income account described in 
                section 403(b)(9) of such Code, except that such account 
                shall not, for purposes of section 403(b)(12) of such

                          (i) shall be treated for purposes of such Code 
                      as a defined contribution plan which is a money 
                      purchase pension plan, and
                          (ii) shall be treated as having made an

                                and
                                    (II) nothing in this section shall 
                                be construed as subjecting any assets
