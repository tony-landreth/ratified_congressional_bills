                      increase pumping shall be accomplished in a manner 
                      consistent with the Record of Decision requirement 
                      to avoid redirected impacts and adverse impacts to 
                      fishery protection and with any applicable Federal

                          (i) evaluation and construction of an intertie 
                      between the State Water Project California 
                      Aqueduct and the Central Valley Project Delta 
                      Mendota Canal, near the City of Tracy, as an 
                      operation and maintenance activity, except that 
                      the Secretary shall design and construct the 
                      intertie in a manner consistent with a possible 
                      future expansion of the intertie capacity (as 
                      described in subsection (f)(1)(B)); and
                          (ii) assessment of a connection of the Central 
                      Valley Project to the Clifton Court Forebay of the 
                      State Water Project, with a corresponding increase 
                      in the screened intake of the Forebay.
                    (D) Program to meet standards.--
                          (i) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> In general.--Prior to 
                      increasing export limits from the Delta for the 
                      purposes of conveying water to south-of-Delta 
                      Central Valley Project contractors or increasing 
                      deliveries through an intertie, the Secretary 
                      shall, not later than 1 year after the date of 
                      enactment of this Act, in consultation with the 
                      Governor, develop and initiate implementation of a 
                      program to meet all existing water quality 
                      standards and objectives for which the Central 
                      Valley Project has responsibility.
                          (ii) Measures.--In developing and implementing 
                      the program, the Secretary shall include, to the 
                      maximum extent feasible, the measures described in 
                      clauses (iii) through (vii).
                          (iii) Recirculation program.--The Secretary 
                      shall incorporate into the program a recirculation 
                      program to provide flow, reduce salinity 
                      concentrations in the San Joaquin River, and 
                      reduce the reliance on the New Melones Reservoir 
                      for meeting water quality and fishery flow 
                      objectives through the use of excess capacity in 
                      export pumping and conveyance facilities.
                          (iv) Best management practices plan.--
                                    (I) In general.--The Secretary shall 
                                develop and implement, in coordination 
                                with the State's programs to improve 
                                water quality in the San Joaquin River, 
                                a best management practices plan to 
                                reduce the water quality impacts of the 
                                discharges from wildlife refuges that 
                                receive water from the Federal 
                                Government and discharge salt or other 
                                constituents into the San Joaquin River.
                                    (II) Coordination with interested 
                                parties.--The plan shall be developed in 
                                coordination with interested parties in 
                                the San Joaquin Valley and the Delta.
                                    (III) Coordination with entities 
                                that discharge water.--The Secretary 
                                shall also coordinate activities under 
                                this clause with other entities that 
                                discharge water into the San Joaquin 
                                River to reduce salinity concentrations 
                                discharged into

[[Page 118 STAT. 1688]]

                                the River, including the timing of 
                                discharges to optimize their 
                                assimilation.
                          (v) Acquisition of water.--The Secretary shall 
                      incorporate into the program the acquisition from 
                      willing sellers of water from streams tributary to 
                      the San Joaquin River or other sources to provide 
                      flow, dilute discharges of salt or other 
                      constituents, and to improve water quality in the 
                      San Joaquin River below the confluence of the 
                      Merced and San Joaquin Rivers, and to reduce the 
                      reliance on New Melones Reservoir for meeting 
                      water quality and fishery flow objectives.
                          (vi) Purpose.--The purpose of the authority 
                      and direction provided to the Secretary under this 
                      subparagraph is to provide greater flexibility in 
                      meeting the existing water quality standards and 
                      objectives for which the Central Valley Project 
                      has responsibility so as to reduce the demand on 
                      water from New Melones Reservoir used for that 
                      purpose and to assist the Secretary in meeting any 
                      obligations to Central Valley Project contractors 
                      from the New Melones Project.
                          (vii) Updating of new melones operating 
                      plan.--The Secretary shall update the New Melones 
                      operating plan to take into account, among other 
                      things, the actions described in this title that 
                      are designed to reduce the reliance on New Melones 
                      Reservoir for meeting water quality and fishery 
                      flow objectives, and to ensure that actions to 
                      enhance fisheries in the Stanislaus River are 
                      based on the best available science.

                Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse Study and 
                other projects, giving priority to projects that include 
                regional solutions to benefit regional water supply and 
                reliability needs.
                    (D) Water measurement and transfer actions.--
                Activities under this paragraph include water 
                measurement and transfer actions.
