Public Law 108-374
108th Congress

                                 An Act


 
    To amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act to improve provisions 
    relating to probate of trust and restricted land, and for other 
             purposes. <<NOTE: Oct. 27, 2004 -  [S. 1721]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: American Indian Probate 
Reform Act of 2004.>> assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian Probate Reform Act of 
2004''.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 15 USC 2201 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Act of February 8, 1887 (commonly known as the 
        ``Indian General Allotment Act'') (25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.), which 
        authorized the allotment of Indian reservations, did not permit 
        Indian allotment owners to provide for the testamentary 
        disposition of the land that was allotted to them;
            (2) that Act provided that allotments would descend 
        according to State law of intestate succession based on the 
        location of the allotment;
            (3) the reliance of the Federal Government on the State law 
        of intestate succession with respect to the descent of 
        allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian 
        tribes, members of Indian tribes, and the Federal Government, 
        including--
                    (A) the increasingly fractionated ownership of trust 
                and restricted land as that land is inherited by 
                successive generations of owners as tenants in common;
                    (B) the application of different rules of intestate 
                succession to each interest of a decedent in or to trust 
                or restricted land if that land is located within the 
                boundaries of more than 1 State, which application--
                          (i) makes probate planning unnecessarily 
                      difficult; and
                          (ii) impedes efforts to provide probate 
                      planning assistance or advice;
                    (C) the absence of a uniform general probate code 
                for trust and restricted land, which makes it difficult 
                for Indian tribes to work cooperatively to develop 
                tribal probate codes; and
                    (D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide 
                for many of the essential elements of general probate 
                law, either directly or by reference, which--
                          (i) is unfair to the owners of trust and 
                      restricted land (and heirs and devisees of 
                      owners); and

[[Page 118 STAT. 1774]]

                          (ii) makes probate planning more difficult;
            (4) a uniform Federal probate code would likely--
                    (A) reduce the number of fractionated interests in 
                trust or restricted land;
                    (B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning 
                assistance and advice and create incentives for owners 
                of trust and restricted land to engage in estate 
                planning;
                    (C) facilitate intertribal efforts to produce tribal 
                probate codes in accordance with section 206 of the 
                Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and
                    (D) provide essential elements of general probate 
                law that are not applicable on the date of enactment of 
                this Act to interests in trust or restricted land; and
            (5) the provisions of a uniform Federal probate code and 
        other forth in this Act should operate to further the policy of 
        the United States as stated in the Indian Land Consolidated Act 
        Amendments of 2000, Public Law 106-462, 102, November 7, 2000, 
        114 Stat. 1992.

SEC. 5. OWNER-MANAGED INTERESTS.

    The Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 221. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2220.>> OWNER-MANAGED INTERESTS.

    ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide a means 
for the co-owners of trust or restricted interests in a parcel of land 
to enter into surface leases of such parcel for certain purposes without 
approval of the Secretary.
    ``(b) Mineral Interests.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
to limit or otherwise affect the application of any Federal law 
requiring the Secretary to approve mineral leases or other agreements 
for the development of the mineral interest in trust or restricted land.
    ``(c) Owner Management.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any provision of Federal 
        law requiring the Secretary to approve individual Indian leases 
        of individual Indian trust or restricted land, where the owners 
        of all of the undivided trust or restricted interests in a 
        parcel of land have submitted applications to the Secretary 
        pursuant to subsection (a), and the Secretary has approved such 
        applications under subsection (d), such owners may, without 
        further approval by the Secretary, enter into a lease of the 
        parcel for agricultural purposes for a term not to exceed 10 
        years.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--No such lease shall be 
        effective until it has been executed by the owners of all 
        undivided trust or restricted interests in the parcel.

    ``(d) Approval of Applications for Owner Management.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph 
        (2), the Secretary shall approve an application for owner 
        management submitted by a qualified applicant pursuant to this 
        section unless the Secretary has reason to believe that the 
        applicant is submitting the application as the result of fraud 
        or undue influence. No such application shall be valid or 
        considered if it is received by the Secretary prior to the date 
        that is 1 year after the date on which notice is published 
        pursuant to section 8(a)(4) of the American Indian Probate 
        Reform Act of 2004.
            ``(2) Commencement of owner-managed status.--Notwithstanding 
        the approval of 1 or more applications pursuant to paragraph 
        (1), no trust or restricted interest in a parcel of land shall 
        acquire owner-managed status until applications for all of the 
        trust or restricted interests in such parcel of land have been 
        submitted to and approved by the Secretary pursuant to this 
        section.

    ``(e) Validity of Leases.--No lease of trust or restricted interests 
in a parcel of land that is owner-managed under this section shall be 
valid or enforceable against the owners of such
