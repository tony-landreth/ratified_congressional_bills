    Sec. 620. <<NOTE: Alaska.>> All disaster loans issued in Alaska 
shall be administered by the Small Business Administration and shall not

    Sec. 621. None of the funds made available in this Act may be

States Government, except pursuant to a transfer made by, or transfer 
authority provided in, this Act or any other appropriation Act.
    Sec. 622. <<NOTE: Deadline. Certification. 5 USC 6120 note.>> The 
Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the Small Business Administration shall, not 
later than two months after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
certify that telecommuting opportunities are made available to 100

Judiciary, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Small Business 
Administration, $5,000,000 shall be available only upon such 
certification: Provided further, That <<NOTE: Reports.>> each Department

Appropriations on the status of telecommuting programs, including the 
number of Federal employees eligible for, and participating in, such

    Sec. 624. (a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released without adequate 
disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.
    (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall 
include in all such data releases, language similar to the following 
that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw broad 
conclusions about firearms-related crime:
            (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
        authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale 
        and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies 
        may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons 
        are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all 
        firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced 
        are used in crime.
            (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for 
        purposes of determining which types, makes or models of firearms 
        are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do not 
        constitute

[[Page 118 STAT. 2920]]

        a random sample and should not be considered representative of 
        the larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any 
        subset of that universe. Firearms are normally traced to the 
        first retail seller, and sources reported for firearms traced do 
        not necessarily represent the sources or methods by which 
        firearms in general are acquired for use in crime.

    Sec. 625. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used 
in violation of section 212(a)(10)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality

of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section 
6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 
2405(j)(1)), has provided support for acts of international terrorism.

    Sec. 628. (a) The Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland 
Security, and the Department of State shall jointly conduct a thorough 
study of all matters relating to the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
interagency process used to review applications for nonimmigrant visas 
issued under section 221(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(8 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(B)). The Department of Justice, the Department of 
Homeland Security, and the Department of State shall, in conducting this 
study, develop recommendations on--

        be eliminated;

        entities that should participate in each such procedure; and
            (4) legislation that could be enacted to increase the 
        efficiency and effectiveness of such procedures.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>> Not later than 1 year after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Department of Justice, the Department 
of Homeland Security, and the Department of State shall jointly submit a 
report to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of 
Representatives which shall contain a detailed statement of the findings 
and conclusions of the study referred to in subsection (a), together

the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the 
Department of State consider appropriate. The report may be submitted in

    ``(e) Capital Security Cost Sharing.--
            ``(1) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, all agencies with personnel overseas subject to chief of 
        mission authority pursuant to section 207 of the Foreign Service

        available until expended.
            ``(2) Implementation.--Implementation of this subsection 
        shall be carried out in a manner that encourages right-sizing of 
        each agency's overseas presence.
            ``(3) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection `agency'

    Sec. 630. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), a project to 
construct a diplomatic facility of the United States may not include 
office space or other accommodations for an employee of a Federal agency 
or department if the Secretary of State determines that such department 
or agency has not provided to the Department of State the full amount of 
funding required by subsection (e) of section 604 of the Secure Embassy 
Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (as enacted into law by 
section 1000(a)(7) of Public Law 106-113 and contained in appendix G of 
that Act; 113 Stat. 1501A-453), as added by section 629 of this Act.

construct a diplomatic facility of the United States may include office 
space or other accommodations for members of the Marine Corps.

            (3) by striking ``There is established'' and inserting the 
        following: ``(1) In general.--There is established''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:

                          DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

    Sec. 301. <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
publication. Notification.>> (a)(1) None of the funds in this or any 
other appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 or any previous fiscal 
year may be used to make payments for a noncompetitive management and 
operating contract unless the Secretary of Energy has published in the 
Federal Register and submitted to the Committees on Appropriations of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate a written notification, with 
respect to each such contract, of the Secretary's decision to use 
competitive procedures for the award of the contract, or to not renew 
the contract, when the term of the contract expires.

    (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to an extension for up to 2 years 
of a noncompetitive management and operating contract, if the extension 
is for purposes of allowing time to award competitively a new contract, 
to provide continuity of service between contracts, or to complete a 
contract that will not be renewed.
    (b) In this section:
            (1) The term ``noncompetitive management and operating 
        contract'' means a contract that was awarded more than 50 years 
        ago without competition for the management and operation of Ames 
        Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley 
        National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and 
        Los Alamos National Laboratory.
            (2) The term ``competitive procedures'' has the meaning 
        provided in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement 
        Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403) and includes procedures described in 
        section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
        Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253) other than a procedure that solicits 
        a proposal from only one source.

    (c) For all management and operating contracts other than those 
listed in subsection (b)(1), none of the funds appropriated by this Act 
may be used to award a management and operating contract, or award a 
significant extension or expansion to an existing management and 
operating contract, unless such contract is awarded using competitive 
procedures or the Secretary of Energy

[[Page 118 STAT. 2958]]

grants, on a case-by-case basis, a waiver to allow for such a deviation. 
The Secretary may not delegate the authority to grant such a 
waiver. <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>> At least 60 days before a contract 
award for which the Secretary intends to grant such a waiver, the 
Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of the House 
of Representatives and the Senate a report notifying the Committees of 
the waiver and setting forth, in specificity, the substantive reasons 
why the Secretary believes the requirement for competition should be 
waived for this particular award.

severance payments and other benefits and community assistance grants 
under section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 42 U.S.C. 7274h) unless the Department of 
Energy submits a reprogramming request subject to approval by the 
appropriate congressional committees.
    Sec. 304. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be used to 
prepare or initiate Requests For Proposals (RFPs) for a program if the 
program has not been funded by Congress.

    Sec. 305. The unexpended balances of prior appropriations provided 
for activities in this Act may be transferred to appropriation accounts 
for such activities established pursuant to this title. Balances so 
transferred may be merged with funds in the applicable established 
accounts and thereafter may be accounted for as one fund for the same 
time period as originally enacted.
    Sec. 306. None of the funds in this or any other Act for the 
Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration may be used to 
enter into any agreement to perform energy efficiency services outside 
the legally defined Bonneville service territory, with the exception of 
services provided internationally, including services provided on a 
reimbursable basis, unless the Administrator certifies in advance that 
such services are not available from private sector businesses.

available to universities or other potential users, or seeks input from 
universities or other potential users regarding significant 
characteristics or equipment in a user facility or a proposed user 
facility, the Department shall ensure broad public notice of such 
availability or such need for input to universities and other potential 
users. When the Department of Energy considers the participation of a 
university or other potential user as a formal partner in the 
establishment or operation of a user facility, the Department shall 
employ full and open competition in selecting such a partner. For 
purposes of this section, the term ``user facility'' includes, but is 
not limited to: (1) a user facility as described in section 2203(a)(2)

        reinstated in 1997, should be immediately and publicly

        country in the boycott when determining to sell weapons to said 
        country; and
            (6) <<NOTE: President. Reports.>> the President should 
        report to Congress annually on specific steps being taken by the 
        United States to encourage Arab League states to normalize their 
        relations with Israel to bring about the termination of the Arab 
        League boycott of Israel, including those to encourage allies

of the functions of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. Any proceeds from such gifts, bequests, or 
devises, after acceptance by the National Endowment for the Arts or the 
National Endowment for the Humanities, shall be paid by the donor or the

appropriate endowment for the purposes specified in each case.
    Sec. 311. (a) In providing services or awarding financial assistance 
under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 
from funds appropriated under this Act, the Chairperson of the National 
Endowment for the Arts shall ensure that priority is given to providing 
services or awarding financial assistance for projects, productions, 
workshops, or programs that serve underserved populations.
    (b) In this section:
            (1) The term ``underserved population'' means a population 
        of individuals, including urban minorities, who have 
        historically been outside the purview of arts and humanities 
        programs due to factors such as a high incidence of income below 
        the poverty line or to geographic isolation.
            (2) The term ``poverty line'' means the poverty line (as 
        defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised 
        annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Community 
        Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)) applicable to a 
        family of the size involved.

    (c) In providing services and awarding financial assistance under 
the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 with 
funds appropriated by this Act, the Chairperson of the National 
Endowment for the Arts shall ensure that priority is given to providing 
services or awarding financial assistance for projects, productions, 
workshops, or programs that will encourage

[[Page 118 STAT. 3095]]

public knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation of the 
arts.
    (d) With funds appropriated by this Act to carry out section 5 of 
the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965--
            (1) <<NOTE: Grants.>> the Chairperson shall establish a 
        grant category for projects, productions, workshops, or programs 
        that are of national impact or availability or are able to tour 
        several States;
            (2) the Chairperson shall not make grants exceeding 15 
        percent, in the aggregate, of such funds to any single State, 
        excluding grants made under the authority of paragraph (1);
            (3) <<NOTE: Reports.>> the Chairperson shall report to the 
        Congress annually and by State, on grants awarded by the 
        Chairperson in each grant category under section 5 of such Act; 
        and
            (4) the Chairperson shall encourage the use of grants to 
        improve and support community-based music performance and 
        education.

    Sec. 312. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall 
be expended or obligated to complete and issue the 5-year program under 
the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act.
    Sec. 313. None of the funds in this Act may be used to support 
Government-wide administrative functions unless such functions are 
justified in the budget process and funding is approved by the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations.
    Sec. 314. <<NOTE: Contracts. State listing.>> Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, for fiscal year 2005 the Secretaries of 
Agriculture and the Interior are authorized to limit competition for 
watershed restoration project contracts as part of the ``Jobs in the 
Woods'' Program established in Region 10 of the Forest Service to 
individuals and entities in historically timber-dependent areas in the 
States of Washington, Oregon, northern California, Idaho, Montana, and 
Alaska that have been affected by reduced timber harvesting on Federal 
lands. The Secretaries shall consider the benefits to the local economy 
in evaluating bids and designing procurements which create economic 
opportunities for local contractors.

    Sec. 315. Amounts deposited during fiscal year 2004 in the roads and 
trails fund provided for in the 14th paragraph under the heading 
``FOREST SERVICE'' of the Act of March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 843; 16 U.S.C. 
501), shall be used by the Secretary of Agriculture, without regard to 
the State in which the amounts were derived, to repair or reconstruct 
roads, bridges, and trails on National Forest System lands or to carry 
out and administer projects to improve forest health conditions, which 
may include the repair or reconstruction of roads, bridges, and trails 
on National Forest System lands in the wildland-community interface 
where there is an abnormally high risk of fire. The projects shall 
emphasize reducing risks to human safety and public health and property 
and enhancing ecological functions, long-term forest productivity, and 
biological integrity. The projects may be completed in a subsequent 
fiscal year. Funds shall not be expended under this section to replace 
funds which would otherwise appropriately be expended from the timber 
salvage sale fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt 
any project from any environmental law.
    Sec. 316. Other than in emergency situations, none of the funds in 
this Act may be used to operate telephone answering machines during core 
business hours unless such answering

[[Page 118 STAT. 3096]]

machines include an option that enables callers to reach promptly an 
individual on-duty with the agency being contacted.
    Sec. 317. No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised if the 
indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a residual value approach 
that assigns domestic Alaska values for western redcedar. Program 
accomplishments shall be based on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in 
the current fiscal year, the annual average portion of the decadal 
allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass Land 
Management Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a 
residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values for western 
redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from those sales which is 
surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska, shall be made 
available to domestic processors in the contiguous 48 United States at 
prevailing domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in the current fiscal 
year, less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale 
quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan in sales which 
are not deficit when appraised using a residual value approach that 
assigns domestic Alaska values for western redcedar, the volume of 
western redcedar timber available to domestic processors at prevailing 
domestic prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that volume: 
(1) which is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska; and 
(2) is that percent of the surplus western redcedar volume determined by 
calculating the ratio of the total timber volume which has been sold on 
the Tongass to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale 
quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan. The 
percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a rolling basis as each 
sale is sold (for purposes of this amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall 
mean that the determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for 
sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale is awarded). 
Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to the needs of domestic 
processors in Alaska'' when the timber sale holder has presented to the 
Forest Service documentation of the inability to sell western redcedar 
logs from a given sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to 
or greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. All 
additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or contiguous 48 
United States domestic processors may be exported to foreign markets at 
the election of the timber sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be 
sold at prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale 
holder.
    Sec. 318. Section 3 of the Act of June 9, 1930 (commonly known as 
the Knutson-Vandenberg Act; 16 U.S.C. 576b), is amended--
            (1) by striking ``The Secretary of Agriculture may, when in 
        his'' and inserting ``(a) The Secretary of Agriculture may, when 
        in his or her'';

    ``(b) Amounts deposited under subsection (a)'';
            (2) by striking ``may direct:'' and all that follows through 
        ``That the Secretary of Agriculture'' and inserting ``may 
        direct. The Secretary of Agriculture''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:

    ``(c) Any portion of the balance at the end of a fiscal year in the 
special fund established pursuant to this section that the Secretary of 
Agriculture determines to be in excess of the cost of doing work 
described in subsection (a) (as well as any portion

[[Page 118 STAT. 3097]]

of the balance in the special fund that the Secretary determined, before 
October 1, 2004, to be excess of the cost of doing work described in 
subsection (a), but which has not been transferred by that date) shall 
be transferred to miscellaneous receipts, National Forest Fund, as a 
National Forest receipt, but only if the Secretary also determines 
that--
            ``(1) the excess amounts will not be needed for emergency 
        wildfire suppression during the fiscal year in which the 
        transfer would be made; and
            ``(2) the amount to be transferred to miscellaneous 
        receipts, National Forest Fund, exceeds the outstanding balance 
        of unreimbursed funds transferred from the special fund in prior 
        fiscal years for wildfire suppression.''.

    Sec. 319. <<NOTE: 16 USC 460l-6a note.>> A project undertaken by the 
Forest Service under the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as 
authorized by section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, shall not 
result in--
            (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to 
        provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. Prior 
        to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult with 
        potentially affected holders to determine what impacts the 
        project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the 
        authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions of 
        the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency; and
            (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the 
        Secretary for operation when such services have been provided in 
        the past by a private sector provider, except when--
                    (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such 
                opportunities;
                    (B) the private sector provider terminates its 
                relationship with the agency; or
                    (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance 
                with the terms and conditions of the authorization.

In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee Demonstration 
Program to provide for operations until a subsequent operator can be 
found through the offering of a new prospectus.
    Sec. 320. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1604 note.>> Prior to October 1, 2005, the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall not be considered to be in violation of 
subparagraph 6(f)(5)(A) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources 
Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)(A)) solely because more than 
15 years have passed without revision of the plan for a unit of the 
National Forest System. Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary 
from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or any other law: 
Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting expeditiously and in good 
faith, within the funding available, to revise a plan for a unit of the 
National Forest System, this section shall be void with respect to such 
plan and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of the plan 
on an accelerated basis.

    Sec. 321. No funds provided in this Act may be expended to conduct 
preleasing, leasing and related activities under either the Mineral 
Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Outer Continental Shelf Lands 
Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) within the boundaries of a National 
Monument established pursuant to the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 431

furnished under said agreements to provide wildfire services are 
considered, for purposes of tort liability, employees of the country 
receiving said services when the individuals are engaged in fire 
suppression: Provided, That the Secretary of Agriculture or the 
Secretary of the Interior shall not enter into any agreement under this 
provision unless the foreign country (either directly or through its

or omissions of American firefighters engaged in firefighting in a 
foreign country: Provided further, That when an agreement is reached for 
furnishing fire fighting services, the only remedies for acts or

remedies for any claim arising out of fighting fires in a foreign 
country: Provided further, That neither the sending country nor any 
legal organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject to 
any legal action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of the 
firefighter's role in fire suppression.
    Sec. 325. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, 
to promote the more efficient use of the health care funding allocation

and who provide employment and training for, dislocated and displaced 
workers in an economically disadvantaged rural community, including 
those historically timber-dependent areas that have been affected by 
reduced timber harvesting on Federal lands and other forest-dependent 
rural communities isolated from significant alternative employment 
opportunities: Provided, That notwithstanding Federal Government

meanings as in section 2374 of Public Law 101-624: Provided further, 
That the Secretaries shall develop guidance to implement this section: 
Provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed as 
relieving the Secretaries of any duty under applicable procurement laws,

completed prior to the date of this Act.
    (e) In preparing any reports to the Committees on Appropriations on 
competitive sourcing activities, agencies funded in this Act shall

        such conveyance for critical San Bernardino National Forest 
        infrastructure improvements or to acquire additional lands 
        within the boundaries of the San Bernardino National Forest.

    (b) Conveyance Required.--Subject to valid existing rights and such

        corrections to this map and may modify the description to 
        correct errors or to reconfigure the property in order to 
        facilitate conveyance. In the event of a conflict between the 
        map description and the USPLSS description of the land in 
        paragraph (1), the map will be considered the definitive 
        description of the land.

parcel of real property referred to in subsection (b), the Association 
and its successors and assigns will indemnify and hold harmless the 
United States for any and all liability to any party that is associated 
with the parcel.
    (h) Treatment of Receipts.--All funds received pursuant to the 
conveyance of the parcel of real property referred to in subsection (b)

    Sec. 342. <<NOTE: Alaska.>> (a) Findings.--
            (1) In 1953, Public Land Order 899 (PLO 899) eliminated 
        approximately 80 acres from the Tongass National Forest, for the 
        Community of Elfin Cove, Alaska. From 1953 until 2001, the USDA 
        Forest Service believed two small islets within the Elfin Cove 
        Harbor (Lots 1 and 2 of U.S. Survey 13150, approximately 0.29 
        acres) were included as part of PLO 899. However, due to a 
        Bureau of Land Management rule in effect when PLO 899 was 
        issued, ownership of unsurveyed, unmapped islets remained with 
        the original landowner, in this case the United States.
            (2) These two islets are needed by the Community of Elfin 
        Cove to resolve public health and safety problems.
            (3) The two islets serve no national forest purposes, but 
        the Forest Service has no authority to transfer ownership of 
        them to the Community of Elfin Cove, without receiving fair 
        market value for the land interests.
            (4) Neither the Bureau of Land Management nor the Forest 
        Service intended to retain Federal ownership of these two 
        islets, and they remained in ownership of the United States only 
        through an inadvertent error.
            (5) Conveyance of these two islets from the United States to 
        the Community of Elfin Cove, Alaska, without consideration, is 
        in the public interest.

    (b) Based on the findings in subsection (a) and notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, Congress hereby authorizes and directs the 
Secretary of Agriculture to convey in fee simple without compensation, 
Lots 1 and 2 of U.S. Survey 13150, comprising approximately 0.29 acres, 
to the Community of Elfin Cove, Alaska.
    Sec. 343. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and until 
October 1, 2007, the Indian Health Service may not disburse funds for 
the provision of health care services pursuant to Public Law 93-638 (25 
U.S.C. 450 et seq.) to any Alaska Native village or Alaska Native 
village corporation that is located within the area served by an Alaska 
Native regional health entity.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the 
disbursal of funds to any Alaska Native village or Alaska Native village 
corporation under any contract or compact entered into prior to May 1, 
2004, or to prohibit the renewal of any such agreement.
    (c) For the purpose <<NOTE: Health and health care.>> of this 
section, Eastern Aleutian Tribes, Inc., shall be treated as an Alaska 
Native regional health entity to whom funds may be disbursed under this 
section.

other provision of law and using funds previously appropriated for such 
purpose under Public Law 106-291 ($1,630,000) and Public Law 108-199 
($2,300,000), the National Park Service shall (1) not later than 60 days 
after enactment of this section purchase the seven parcels of real 
property in Seward, Alaska identified by Kenai Peninsula tax 
identification numbers 14910001, 14910002, 14911033, 14913005, 14913020, 
14913007, and 14913008 that have been selected for the administrative 
complex, visitor facility, plaza and related parking for the Kenai 
Fjords National Park and Chugach National Forest which shall hereafter 
be known as the Mary Lowell Center; and (2) transfer to the City of 
Seward any remaining balance of previously appropriated funds not 
necessary for property acquisition and design upon the vacation by the 
City of Seward of Washington Street between 4th Avenue and 5th Avenue 
and transfer of title of the appropriate portions thereof to the Federal 
Government, provided that the City of Seward uses any such funds for the 
related waterfront planning, pavilions, boardwalks, trails, or related 
purposes that compliment the new Federal facility.

                    (A) <<NOTE: James Pinchot. Mary Pinchot.>> James and 
                Mary Pinchot constructed a home and estate that is known 
                as Grey Towers in Milford, Pennsylvania.
                    (B) James and Mary Pinchot were also the progenitors 
                of a family of notable accomplishment in the history of 
                the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation, in 
                particular, their son, Gifford Pinchot. 
                    (C) <<NOTE: Gifford Pinchot.>> Gifford Pinchot was 
                the first Chief of the Forest Service, a major influence 
                in formulating and implementing forest conservation 
                policies in the early 20th Century, and twice Governor 
                of Pennsylvania.
                    (D) During the early 20th century, James and Gifford 
                Pinchot used Grey Towers and the environs to establish

                scientific forestry, to develop conservation leaders, 
                and to formulate conservation principles, thus making 
                this site one of the primary birthplaces of the American 
                conservation movement.

                private sectors.
                    (G) Grey Towers today is a place of historical 
                significance where leaders in natural resource 
                conservation meet, study, and share ideas, analyses, 
                values, and philosophies, and is also a place where the 
                public can learn and appreciate our conservation 
                heritage.
                    (H) As established by President Kennedy, the Pinchot 
                Institute for Conservation, and the Forest Service at

                in developing and delivering programs that carry on

           General Provisions--Federal Highway Administration


    Sec. 110. (a) <<NOTE: 23 USC 104 note.>> For fiscal year 2005, the 
Secretary of Transportation shall--
            (1) not distribute from the obligation limitation for 
        Federal-aid highways amounts authorized for administrative 
        expenses and programs funded from the administrative takedown 
        authorized by section 104(a)(1)(A) of title 23, United States 
        Code, for the highway use tax evasion program, for the Bureau of 
        Transportation Statistics, and for the programs, projects, and 
        activities funded from the takedown authorized by section 117 of 
        this Act;
            (2) not distribute an amount from the obligation limitation 
        for Federal-aid highways that is equal to the unobligated 
        balance of amounts made available from the Highway Trust Fund 
        (other than the Mass Transit Account) for Federal-aid highways 
        and highway safety programs for the prior fiscal years the funds 
        for which are allocated by the Secretary;
            (3) determine the ratio that--
                    (A) the obligation limitation for Federal-aid 
                Highways less the aggregate of amounts not distributed 
                under paragraphs (1) and (2), bears to
                    (B) the total of the sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for Federal-aid highways and highway safety 
                construction programs (other than sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for sections set forth in paragraphs (1) 
                through (7) of subsection (b) and sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for section 105 of title 23, United States 
                Code, equal to the amount referred to in subsection 
                (b)(8)) for such fiscal year less the aggregate of the 
                amounts not distributed under paragraph (1) of this 
                subsection;

[[Page 118 STAT. 3210]]

            (4) distribute the obligation limitation for Federal-aid 
        highways less the aggregate amounts not distributed under 
        paragraphs (1) and (2) for section 201 of the Appalachian 
        Regional Development Act of 1965 and $2,000,000,000 for such 
        fiscal year under section 105 of title 23, United States Code 
        (relating to minimum guarantee) so that the amount of obligation 
        authority available for each of such sections is equal to the 
        amount determined by multiplying the ratio determined under 
        paragraph (3) by the sums authorized to be appropriated for such 
        section (except in the case of section 105, $2,000,000,000) for 
        such fiscal year;
            (5) distribute the obligation limitation provided for 
        Federal-aid highways less the aggregate amounts not distributed 
        under paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts distributed under 
        paragraph (4) for each of the programs that are allocated by the 
        Secretary under title 23, United States Code (other than 
        activities to which paragraph (1) applies and programs to which 
        paragraph (4) applies) by multiplying the ratio determined under 
        paragraph (3) by the sums authorized to be appropriated for such 
        program for such fiscal year; and
            (6) distribute the obligation limitation provided for 
        Federal-aid highways less the aggregate amounts not distributed 
        under paragraphs (1) and (2) and amounts distributed under 
        paragraphs (4) and (5) for Federal-aid highways and highway 
        safety construction programs (other than the minimum guarantee 
        program, but only to the extent that amounts apportioned for the 
        minimum guarantee program for such fiscal year exceed 
        $2,639,000,000, and the Appalachian development highway system 
        program) that are apportioned by the Secretary under title 23, 
        United States Code, in the ratio that--
                    (A) sums authorized to be appropriated for such 
                programs that are apportioned to each State for such 
                fiscal year, bear to
                    (B) the total of the sums authorized to be 
                appropriated for such programs that are apportioned to 
                all States for such fiscal year.

    (b) Exceptions From Obligation Limitation.--The obligation 
limitation for Federal-aid highways shall not apply to obligations: (1) 
under section 125 of title 23, United States Code; (2) under section 147 
of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978; (3) under section 
9 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1981; (4) under sections 131(b) and 
131(j) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982; (5) under 
sections 149(b) and 149(c) of the Surface Transportation and Uniform 
Relocation Assistance Act of 1987; (6) under sections 1103 through 1108 
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991; (7) 
under section 157 of title 23, United States Code, as in effect on the 
day before the date of the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act 
for the 21st Century; (8) under section 105 of title 23, United States 
Code (but, only in an amount equal to $639,000,000 for such fiscal 
year); and (9) for Federal-aid highway programs for which obligation 
authority was made available under the Transportation Equity Act for the 
21st Century or subsequent public laws for multiple years or to remain 
available until used, but only to the extent that such obligation 
authority has not lapsed or been used.
    (c) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall after August 1

[[Page 118 STAT. 3211]]

for such fiscal year revise a distribution of the obligation limitation 
made available under subsection (a) if a State will not obligate the 
amount distributed during that fiscal year and redistribute sufficient 
amounts to those States able to obligate amounts in addition to those 
previously distributed during that fiscal year giving priority to those 
States having large unobligated balances of funds apportioned under 
sections 104 and 144 of title 23, United States Code, section 160 (as in 
effect on the day before the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act 
for the 21st Century) of title 23, United States Code, and under section 
1015 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.
    (d) Applicability of Obligation Limitations to Transportation 
Research Programs.--The obligation limitation shall apply to 
transportation research programs carried out under chapter 5 of title 
23, United States Code, except that obligation authority made available 
for such programs under such limitation shall remain available for a 
period of 3 fiscal years.
    (e) Redistribution <<NOTE: Deadline.>> of Certain Authorized 
Funds.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the distribution of 
obligation limitation under subsection (a), the Secretary shall 
distribute to the States any funds: (1) that are authorized to be 
appropriated for such fiscal year for Federal-aid highways programs 
(other than the program under section 160 of title 23, United States 
Code) and for carrying out subchapter I of chapter 311 of title 49, 
United States Code, and highway-related programs under chapter 4 of 
title 23, United States Code; and (2) that the Secretary determines will 
not be allocated to the States, and will not be available for 
obligation, in such fiscal year due to the imposition of any obligation 
limitation for such fiscal year. Such distribution to the States shall 
be made in the same ratio as the distribution of obligation authority 
under subsection (a)(6). The funds so distributed shall be available for 
any purposes described in section 133(b) of title 23, United States 
Code.

    (f) Special Rule.--Obligation limitation distributed for a fiscal 
year under subsection (a)(4) of this section for a section set forth in

of assisting State-supported intercity rail service, in order to 
demonstrate whether competition will provide higher quality rail 
passenger service at reasonable prices, the Secretary of Transportation, 
working with affected States, shall develop and implement a procedure 
for fair competitive bidding by Amtrak and non-Amtrak operators for 
State-supported routes: Provided, That in the event a State desires to 
select or selects a non-Amtrak operator for the route, the State may 
make an agreement with Amtrak to use facilities and equipment of, or 
have services provided by, Amtrak under terms agreed to by the State and 
Amtrak to enable the non-Amtrak operator to provide the State-supported 
service: Provided further, That if the parties cannot agree on terms, 
the Secretary shall, as a condition of receipt of Federal grant funds, 
order that the facilities and equipment be made available and the 
services be provided by Amtrak under reasonable terms and compensation: 
Provided further, That when prescribing reasonable compensation to 
Amtrak, the Secretary shall consider quality of service as a major 
factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of 
compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the 
facilities and providing the services: Provided further, That the 
Secretary may reprogram up to $2,500,000 from the Amtrak operating grant 
funds for costs associated with the implementation of the fair bid 
procedure and demonstration of competition under this section.

services may provide, and no purchaser of such services may obtain, 
covered services in the same contract with services other than those

and injunctive relief) before the FCC (whose final order may be appealed 
under 47 U.S.C. 402(a)) or under 47 U.S.C. 207 if the FCC fails to issue 
a final order within 90 days of a filing. Nothing herein shall affect 
rate integration, carrier-of-last-resort obligations of any carrier or 
its successor, or the purchase of covered services by any rural 
telephone company (as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153(37)), or an affiliate 
under its control, for its provision of retail interstate interexchange 
services originating in the market.

REVOLUTION COMMEMORATION ACT

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``225th Anniversary of the American 
Revolution Commemoration Act''.

SEC. 202. <<NOTE: 36 USC note prec. 101.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The American Revolution, inspired by the spirit of 
        liberty and independence among the inhabitants of the original 
        13 colonies of Great Britain, was an event of global 
        significance having a profound and lasting effect upon American 
        Government, laws, culture, society, and values.
            (2) The years 2000 through 2008 mark the 225th anniversary 
        of the Revolutionary War.
            (3) Every generation of American citizens should have an 
        opportunity to understand and appreciate the continuing legacy 
        of the American Revolution.
            (4) This 225th anniversary provides an opportunity to 
        enhance public awareness and understanding of the impact of the 
        American Revolution's legacy on the lives of citizens today.
            (5) Although the National Park Service administers 
        battlefields, historical parks, historic sites, and programs 
        that address elements of the story of the American Revolution, 
        there is a need to establish partnerships that link sites and 
        programs

[[Page 118 STAT. 3349]]

        administered by the National Park Service with those of other 
        Federal and non-Federal entities in order to place the story of 
        the American Revolution in the broad context of its causes, 
        consequences, and meanings.
            (6) The story and significance of the American Revolution 
        can best engage the American people through a national program 
        of the National Park Service that links historic structures and 
        sites, routes, activities, community projects, exhibits, and 
        multimedia materials, in a manner that is both unified and 
        flexible.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To recognize the enduring importance of the American 
        Revolution in the lives of American citizens today.
            (2) To authorize the National Park Service to coordinate, 
        connect, and facilitate Federal and non-Federal activities to 
        commemorate, honor, and interpret the history of the American 
        Revolution, its significance, and its relevance to the shape and 
        spirit of American Government and society.

    ``(G)(i) The Secretary of Labor may initiate an investigation of any 
employer that employs nonimmigrants described in section 
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) if the Secretary of Labor has reasonable cause to 
believe that the employer is not in compliance with this subsection. In 
the case of an investigation under this clause, the Secretary of Labor 
(or the acting Secretary in the case of the absence of disability of the 
Secretary of Labor) shall personally certify that reasonable cause 
exists and shall approve commencement of the investigation. The 
investigation may be initiated for reasons other than completeness and 
obvious inaccuracies by the employer in complying with this subsection.
    ``(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible 
information from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an 
employer's practices or employment conditions, or an employer's 
compliance with the employer's labor condition application under 
paragraph (1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, 
and such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the 
employer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of 
paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has 
engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, 
or has committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that 
affects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an 
investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of 
Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer, and the 
source's identity shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 
of title 5, United States Code.
    ``(iii) <<NOTE: Procedures.>> The Secretary of Labor shall establish 
a procedure for any person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor 
information described in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in 
part, as the basis for the commencement of an investigation described in 
such clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed 
and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on behalf of 
the person. The person may not be an officer or employee of the 
Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the requirement of 
clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the Department of 
Labor may complete the form on behalf of the person).

    ``(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of 
Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies the 
requirements of such clause and that--
            ``(I) originates from a source other than an officer or 
        employee of the Department of Labor; or
            ``(II) was lawfully obtained by the Secretary of Labor in

by an employer to the Attorney General or the Secretary of Labor for

described in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted 
with respect to information about a failure to meet a condition 
described in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the 
information not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged 
failure.

notice to an employer with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to 
initiate an investigation described in clauses (i) or (ii), prior to the 
commencement of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to 
conduct an investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, 
and shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond 
to the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Secretary 
of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the Secretary of 
Labor determines that to do so would interfere with an effort by the 
Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the employer with the 
requirements of this subsection. There shall be no judicial review of a 
determination by the Secretary of Labor under this clause.

    ``(viii) An investigation under clauses (i) or (ii) may be conducted 
for a period of up to 60 days. <<NOTE: Notice.>> If the Secretary of 
Labor determines after such an investigation that a reasonable basis 
exists to make a finding that the employer has committed a willful 
failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), 
(1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of 
failures to meet such a condition, or has committed a substantial 
failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple employees, the 
Secretary of Labor shall provide for notice of such determination to the 
interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with 
section 556 of title 5, United States Code, within 120 days after the 
date of the determination. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> If such a hearing is 
requested, the Secretary of Labor shall make a finding concerning the

        prevailing wage was calculated was consistent with recognized 
        industry standards and practices.
            ``(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or

       TITLE V--NATIONAL <<NOTE: National Aviation Heritage Area 
Act.>> AVIATION HERITAGE AREA

SEC. 501. <<NOTE: 16 USC 461 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``National Aviation Heritage Area 
Act''.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 16 USC 461 note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Few technological advances have transformed the world or 
        our Nation's economy, society, culture, and national character 
        as the development of powered flight.
            (2) The industrial, cultural, and natural heritage legacies 
        of the aviation and aerospace industry in the State of Ohio are 
        nationally significant.
            (3) Dayton, Ohio, and other defined areas where the 
        development of the airplane and aerospace technology established 
        our Nation's leadership in both civil and military aeronautics 
        and astronautics set the foundation for the 20th Century to be 
        an American Century.
            (4) Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, is the 
        birthplace, the home, and an integral part of the future of 
        aerospace.
            (5) The economic strength of our Nation is connected 
        integrally to the vitality of the aviation and aerospace 
        industry, which is responsible for an estimated 11,200,000 
        American jobs.
            (6) The industrial and cultural heritage of the aviation and 
        aerospace industry in the State of Ohio includes the social 
        history and living cultural traditions of several generations.
            (7) The Department of the Interior is responsible for 
        protecting and interpreting the Nation's cultural and historic 
        resources, and there are significant examples of these resources 
        within Ohio to merit the involvement of the Federal Government 
        to develop programs and projects in cooperation with the 
        Aviation Heritage Foundation, Incorporated, the State of Ohio, 
        and other local and governmental entities to adequately 
        conserve, protect, and interpret this heritage for the 
        educational and recreational benefit of this and future 
        generations of Americans, while providing opportunities for 
        education and revitalization.
            (8) Since the enactment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage 
        Preservation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-419), partnerships 
        among the Federal, State, and local governments and the private 
        sector have greatly assisted the development and preservation of 
        the historic aviation resources in the Miami Valley.
            (9) An aviation heritage area centered in Southwest Ohio is 
        a suitable and feasible management option to increase

[[Page 118 STAT. 3362]]

        collaboration, promote heritage tourism, and build on the 
        established partnerships among Ohio's historic aviation 
        resources and related sites.
            (10) A critical level of collaboration among the historic 
        aviation resources in Southwest Ohio cannot be achieved without 
        a congressionally established national heritage area and the 
        support of the National Park Service and other Federal agencies 
        which own significant historic aviation-related sites in Ohio.
            (11) The Aviation Heritage Foundation, Incorporated, would 
        be an appropriate management entity to oversee the development 
        of the National Aviation Heritage Area.
            (12) Five National Park Service and Dayton Aviation Heritage 
        Commission studies and planning documents: ``Study of 
        Alternatives: Dayton's Aviation Heritage'', ``Dayton Aviation 
        Heritage National Historical Park Suitability/Feasibility 
        Study'', ``Dayton Aviation Heritage General Management Plan'', 
        ``Dayton Historic Resources Preservation and Development Plan'', 
        and Heritage Area Concept Study, demonstrated that sufficient 
        historical resources exist to establish the National Aviation 
        Heritage Area.
            (13) With the advent of the 100th anniversary of the first 
        powered flight in 2003, it is recognized that the preservation 
        of properties nationally significant in the history of aviation 
        is an important goal for the future education of Americans.
            (14) Local governments, the State of Ohio, and private 
        sector interests have embraced the heritage area concept and 
        desire to enter into a partnership with the Federal Government 
        to preserve, protect, and develop the Heritage Area for public 
        benefit.
            (15) The National Aviation Heritage Area would complement 
        and enhance the aviation-related resources within the National 
        Park Service, especially the Dayton Aviation Heritage National 
        Historical Park, Ohio.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish the Heritage 
Area to--
            (1) encourage and facilitate collaboration among the 
        facilities, sites, organizations, governmental entities, and 
        educational institutions within the Heritage Area to promote 
        heritage tourism and to develop educational and cultural 
        programs for the public;
            (2) preserve and interpret for the educational and 
        inspirational benefit of present and future generations the 
        unique and significant contributions to our national heritage of 
        certain historic and cultural lands, structures, facilities, and 
        sites within the National Aviation Heritage Area;
            (3) encourage within the National Aviation Heritage Area a 
        broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality of 
        life for present and future generations;
            (4) provide a management framework to assist the State of 
        Ohio, its political subdivisions, other areas, and private 
        organizations, or combinations thereof, in preparing and 
        implementing an integrated Management Plan to conserve their 
        aviation heritage and in developing policies and programs that 
        will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, historical, 
        natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the Heritage Area; 
        and

[[Page 118 STAT. 3363]]

            (5) authorize the Secretary to provide financial and 
        technical assistance to the State of Ohio, its political 
        subdivisions, and private organizations, or combinations 
        thereof, in preparing and implementing the private Management 
        Plan.

            (1) The Oil Region of Northwestern Pennsylvania, with 
        numerous sites and districts listed on the National Register of 
        Historic Places, and designated by the Governor of Pennsylvania 
        as one of the State Heritage Park Areas, is a region with 
        tremendous physical and natural resources and possesses a story 
        of State, national, and international significance.
            (2) The single event of Colonel Edwin Drake's drilling of 
        the world's first successful oil well in 1859 has affected the 
        industrial, natural, social, and political structures of the 
        modern world.
            (3) Six national historic districts are located within the 
        State Heritage Park boundary, in Emlenton, Franklin, Oil City, 
        and Titusville, as well as 17 separate National Register sites.
            (4) The Allegheny River, which was designated as a component 
        of the national wild and scenic rivers system in 1992 by Public 
        Law 102-271, traverses the Oil Region and connects several of 
        its major sites, as do some of the river's tributaries such as 
        Oil Creek, French Creek, and Sandy Creek.
            (5) The unspoiled rural character of the Oil Region provides 
        many natural and recreational resources, scenic vistas, and 
        excellent water quality for people throughout the United States 
        to enjoy.
            (6) Remnants of the oil industry, visible on the landscape 
        to this day, provide a direct link to the past for visitors, as 
        do the historic valley settlements, riverbed settlements, 
        plateau developments, farmlands, and industrial landscapes.
            (7) The Oil Region also represents a cross section of 
        American history associated with Native Americans, frontier 
        settlements, the French and Indian War, African Americans and 
        the Underground Railroad, and immigration of Swedish and Polish 
        individuals, among others.
            (8) Involvement by the Federal Government shall serve to 
        enhance the efforts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

[[Page 118 STAT. 3369]]

        volunteer organizations, and private businesses, to promote the

        conditions of the licenses under such sections, an analysis of 
        whether these differences are required or justified by 
        historical, technological, or regulatory differences that affect 
        the satellite and cable industries, and an analysis of whether

                resulted from flow modifications or reductions in the 
                quantity of water available that accrued at any time up 
                to and including the effective date of the settlement,

                including the effective date determined under paragraph 
                (2);
                    (B) all claims for injuries to the Tribe's treaty

                or resulted from reductions in the quantity of water

                      lender authorized by the Administration to 
                      participate in the Express Loan Program.
                          ``(ii) The term `express loan' means any loan 
                      made pursuant to this paragraph in which a lender 
                      utilizes to the maximum extent practicable its own 
                      loan analyses, procedures, and documentation.
                          ``(iii) The term `Express Loan Program' means

                    ``(B) Restriction to express lender.--The authority

                lenders deemed qualified to make such loans by the 
                Administration. Designation as an express lender for 
                purposes of making an express loan shall not prohibit 
                such lender from taking any other action authorized by 
                the Administration for that lender pursuant to this 
                subsection.
                    ``(C) Grandfathering of existing lenders.--Any 
                express lender shall retain such designation unless the

                violated the law or regulations promulgated by the 
                Administration or modifies the requirements to be an 
                express lender and the lender no longer satisfies those 
                requirements.

                notification pursuant to paragraph (24), that has the 
                effect of requiring a lender to make an express loan 
                pursuant to subparagraph (D).''.

                guaranteed under this subsection (other than a loan that 
                is repayable in 1 year or less), the Administration 
                shall collect a guarantee fee, which shall be payable by 
                the participating lender, and may be charged to the 
                borrower, as follows:
                          ``(i) A guarantee fee not to exceed 2 percent 
                      of the deferred participation share of a total 
                      loan amount that is not more than $150,000.
                          ``(ii) A guarantee fee not to exceed 3 percent 
                      of the deferred participation share of a total 
                      loan amount that is more than $150,000, but not 
                      more than $700,000.
                          ``(iii) A guarantee fee not to exceed 3.5 
                      percent of the deferred participation share of a 
                      total loan amount that is more than $700,000.
                          ``(iv) In addition to the fee under clause 
                      (iii), a guarantee fee equal to 0.25 percent of 
                      any portion of the deferred participation share 
                      that is more than $1,000,000.''.

        ``Yearly'';
            (2) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the 
        following:
                    ``(A) In general.--With respect to each loan 
                approved under this subsection, the Administration shall 
                assess, collect, and retain a fee, not to exceed 0.55 
                percent per year of the outstanding balance of the 
                deferred participation share of the loan, in an amount 
                established once annually by the Administration in the 
                Administration's annual budget request to Congress, as 
                necessary to reduce to zero the cost to the 
                Administration of making guarantees under this 
                subsection. As used in this paragraph, the term `cost'

[[Page 118 STAT. 3444]]

                has the meaning given that term in section 502 of the 
                Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a).'';
            (3) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``annual'' and 
        inserting ``yearly''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(C) Lowering of borrower fees.--If the 
                Administration determines that fees paid by lenders and 
                by small business borrowers for guarantees under this 
                subsection may be reduced, consistent with reducing to 
                zero the cost to the Administration of making such 
                guarantees--
                          ``(i) the Administration shall first consider 
                      reducing fees paid by small business borrowers 
                      under clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph 
                      (18)(A), to the maximum extent possible; and
                          ``(ii) fees paid by small business borrowers 
                      shall not be increased above the levels in effect 
                      on the date of enactment of this subparagraph.''.
