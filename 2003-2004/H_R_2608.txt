     TITLE II-- <<NOTE: National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 
2004.>> WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15701 note.>> 

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Windstorm Impact Reduction 
Act of 2004''.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15701.>> 

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and 
        thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, 
        destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. All 
        States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards.

[[Page 118 STAT. 1676]]

            (2) The United States currently sustains several billion 
        dollars in economic damages each year due to these windstorms. 
        In recent decades, rapid development and population growth in 
        high-risk areas has greatly increased overall vulnerability to 
        windstorms.
            (3) Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the 
        potential to reduce these losses through--
                    (A) cost-effective and affordable design and 
                construction methods and practices;
                    (B) effective mitigation programs at the local, 
                State, and national level;
                    (C) improved data collection and analysis and impact 
                prediction methodologies;
                    (D) engineering research on improving new structures 
                and retrofitting existing ones to better withstand 
                windstorms, atmospheric-related research to better 
                understand the behavior and impact of windstorms on the 
                built environment, and subsequent application of those 
                research results; and
                    (E) public education and outreach.
            (4) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government 
        in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective Federal 
        program in windstorm impact reduction will require interagency 
        coordination, and input from individuals, academia, the private 
        sector, and other interested non-Federal entities.
