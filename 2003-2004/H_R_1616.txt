SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Martin Luther King, Junior, National 
Historic Site Land Exchange Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Public Law 96-438 established the Martin Luther King, 
        Junior, National Historic Site, and allows acquisition, by 
        donation only, of lands owned by the State.
            (2) The National Park Service owns a vacant lot that has no 
        historic significance. The City of Atlanta has expressed 
        interest in acquiring this property to encourage commercial 
        development along Edgewood Avenue.
            (3) The National Historic Site Visitor Center and Museum is 
        land-locked and has no emergency ingress or egress, making it 
        virtually impossible for firefighting equipment to reach.
            (4) The acquisition of city-owned property would enable the 
        National Park Service to establish easy street access to the 
        National Historic Site Visitor Center and Museum, and would 
        benefit the City by exchanging a piece of property that the City 
        could develop.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the exchange 
of certain lands within the Martin Luther King, Junior, National 
Historic Site for lands owned by the City of Atlanta, Georgia.
