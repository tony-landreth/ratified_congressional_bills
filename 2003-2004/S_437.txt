subsidence damage and related damage that occurs after the

    (b) Damage.--Under the program, the Community, a Community member, 
or an allottee may submit to the Secretary a request for the repair or 
remediation of--
            (1) subsidence damage; and

        geologic strata or cracking in the earth's surface of any

[[Page 118 STAT. 3523]]

        length or depth, which settling or cracking is caused by pumping 
        of underground water.

    (c) Repair or Remediation.--The Secretary shall perform the 
requested repair or remediation if--
            (1) the Secretary determines that the Community has not

transfer for the benefit of the Community.
    (b) Water Rights.--After-acquired trust land shall not include 
federally reserved rights to surface water or groundwater.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that future Acts

                title standards in effect on the date of the Community's 
                submission.
            (2) Reservation status.--Land taken or held in trust by the 
        Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be deemed part of the

                                appraisal to ensure its consistency with 
                                nationally approved standards and notify 
                                the Districts of the results of the 
                                review within 30 days of resubmission.
                                    (III) Petition.--In the event that 
                                the Secretary finds that such 
                                resubmitted appraisal is not consistent 
                                with those Standards, either the 
                                Districts or the Secretary may petition 
                                a Federal court in the District of 
                                Arizona for a determination of whether 
                                the appraisal is consistent with 
                                nationally approved Standards. If such 
                                court finds the appraisal is so 
                                consistent, the value stated in the 
                                appraisal shall be final for all 
                                purposes. If such court finds the 
                                appraisal is not so consistent, the 
                                court shall determine the average value 
                                of water rights appurtenant to 1,000 TBI 
                                eligible acres.
                                    (IV) No objection.--If the Secretary 
                                does not object to an appraisal within 
                                the time periods provided in this clause 
                                (i), the value determined in the 
                                appraisal shall be final for all 
                                purposes.
                          (ii) Appraisal.--In determining the value of

                      court, the Districts, the Secretary, and any 
                      appraiser shall take into account the obligations 
                      the owner of the land (to which the rights are 
                      appurtenant) will have after acquisition for

                      agreement and to comply with environmental laws 
                      because of the acquisition and severance and 
                      transfer or extinguishment of the water rights.
                          (iii) Payment.--No more than 30 days after the 
                      average value of water rights appurtenant to 1,000 
                      acres of land has been determined in accordance 
                      with clauses (i) and (ii), the Secretary shall pay 
                      125 percent of such values to the Districts.

                      one thousand (1,000) acres of lands that would 
                      have been included in the calculation of TBI 
                      eligible acres (other than special hot lands), if 
                      the calculation of TBI eligible acres had been 
                      undertaken at the time of acquisition. To the 
                      extent possible, the Districts shall select the 
                      rights to be acquired in compliance with

        the acquisition of UV decreed water rights under paragraph (2), 
        the number of TBI eligible acres, but not the number of acres of 
        UV subjugated land, shall be reduced by the number of acres 
        associated with those UV decreed water rights.

        ``(1) <<NOTE: Contracts.>> In the operation of the Central 
        Arizona Project, the Secretary shall offer to contract with 
        water users in the State of New Mexico, with the approval of its 
        Interstate Stream Commission, or with the State of New Mexico, 
        through its Interstate Stream Commission, for water from the 
        Gila River, its tributaries and underground water sources in 
        amounts that will permit consumptive use of water in New Mexico 
        of not to exceed an annual average in any period of 10 
        consecutive years of 14,000 acre-feet, including reservoir

        consumptive uses shall continue only so long as delivery of 
        Colorado River water to downstream Gila River users in Arizona 
        is being accomplished in accordance with this Act, in quantities 
        sufficient to replace any diminution of their supply resulting

    (f) Exclusion of Costs.--For the purpose of determining the 
allocation and repayment of costs of the Central Arizona Project under 
the CAP Repayment Contract, the costs associated with the New Mexico 
Unit and the delivery of Central Arizona Project water pursuant to the

        under this section shall not constitute a major Federal action 
        under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
        seq.). The Secretary is directed to carry out all necessary 
        environmental compliance required by Federal law in implementing 
        the New Mexico Consumptive Use and Forbearance Agreement and the 
        New Mexico Unit Agreement.
            (3) Lead agency.--The Bureau of Reclamation shall be

Fund established and administered by the New Mexico Interstate Stream 
Commission. Withdrawals from the New Mexico Unit Fund shall be for the 
purpose of paying costs of the New Mexico Unit or other water 
utilization alternatives to meet water supply demands in the Southwest 
Water Planning Region of New Mexico, as determined by the New Mexico 
Interstate Stream Commission in consultation with the Southwest New

[[Page 118 STAT. 3530]]

(2)(D)(ii) of section 403(f) of the Colorado River Basin Project Act (43 
U.S.C. 1543(f)) (as amended by section 107(a)) on a construction 
schedule basis, up to a maximum amount under this subparagraph (j) of 
$34,000,000, as adjusted to reflect changes since January 1, 2004, in 
the construction cost indices applicable to the types of construction 
involved in construction of the New Mexico Unit, upon satisfaction of 
the conditions that--
            (1) <<NOTE: Notices.>> the State of New Mexico must provide 
        notice to the Secretary in writing not later than December 31, 
        2014, that the State of New Mexico intends to have constructed 
        or developed the New Mexico Unit; and
            (2) <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>> the Secretary 
        must have issued in the Federal Register not later than December 
        31, 2019, a Record of Decision approving the project based on an 
        environmental analysis required pursuant to applicable Federal 
        law and on a demonstration that construction of a project for 
        the New Mexico Unit that would deliver an average annual safe 
        yield, based on a 50-year planning period, greater than 10,000 
        acre feet per year, would not cost more per acre foot of water 
        diverted than a project sized to produce an average annual safe 
        yield of 10,000 acre feet per year. If New Mexico exercises all 
        reasonable efforts to obtain the issuance of such Record of 
        Decision, but the Secretary is not able to issue such Record of 
        Decision by December 31, 2019, for reasons outside the control 
        of the State of New Mexico, the Secretary may extend the
