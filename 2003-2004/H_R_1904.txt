            (1) In general.--Except in old growth stands where the 
        management direction is consistent with subsection (e)(2), the 
        Secretary shall carry out a covered project in a manner that--
                    (A) focuses largely on small diameter trees, 
                thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and prescribed fire to 
                modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected 
                reduction of uncharacteristically severe wildfire 
                effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil 
                impacts, tree mortality or other impacts); and
                    (B) maximizes the retention of large trees, as 
                appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the 
                trees promote fire-resilient stands.

        shall include a description of the changes in condition class, 
        using the Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook or successor 
        guidance, specifically comparing end results to--
                    (A) pretreatment conditions;
                    (B) historical fire regimes; and
                    (C) any applicable watershed or landscape goals or 
                objectives in the resource management plan or other 
                relevant direction.
            (5) Multiparty monitoring.--
                    (A) In general.--In an area where significant 
                interest is expressed in multiparty monitoring, the 
                Secretary shall establish a multiparty monitoring, 
                evaluation, and accountability process in order to 
                assess the positive or negative ecological and social

                TITLE III--WATERSHED FORESTRY ASSISTANCE

SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 16 USC 6541.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there has been a dramatic shift in public attitudes and 
        perceptions about forest management, particularly in the 
        understanding and practice of sustainable forest management;
            (2) it is commonly recognized that the proper stewardship of 
        forest land is essential to sustaining and restoring the health 
        of watersheds;
            (3) forests can provide essential ecological services in 
        filtering pollutants, buffering important rivers and estuaries, 
        and minimizing flooding, which makes forest restoration worthy 
        of special focus; and
            (4) strengthened education, technical assistance, and 
        financial assistance for nonindustrial private forest landowners 
        and communities, relating to the protection of watershed health, 
        is needed to realize the expectations of the general public.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to improve landowner and public understanding of the 
        connection between forest management and watershed health;

[[Page 117 STAT. 1903]]

            (2) to encourage landowners to maintain tree cover on 
        property and to use tree plantings and vegetative treatments as 
        creative solutions to watershed problems associated with varying 
        land uses;
            (3) to enhance and complement forest management and buffer 
        use for watersheds, with an emphasis on community watersheds;
            (4) to establish new partnerships and collaborative 
        watershed approaches to forest management, stewardship, and 
        conservation;
            (5) to provide technical and financial assistance to States 
        to deliver a coordinated program that enhances State forestry 
        best-management practices programs, and conserves and improves 
        forested land and potentially forested land, through technical, 
        financial, and educational assistance to qualifying individuals 
        and entities; and
            (6) to maximize the proper management and conservation of 
        wetland forests and to assist in the restoration of those 
        forests.

           TITLE IV--INSECT INFESTATIONS AND RELATED DISEASES

SEC. 401. <<NOTE: 16 USC 6551.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) high levels of tree mortality resulting from insect 
        infestation (including the interaction between insects and 
        diseases) may result in--
                    (A) increased fire risk;
                    (B) loss of old trees and old growth;
                    (C) loss of threatened and endangered species;
                    (D) loss of species diversity;
                    (E) degraded watershed conditions;
                    (F) increased potential for damage from other agents 
                of disturbance, including exotic, invasive species; and
                    (G) decreased timber values;
            (2)(A) forest-damaging insects destroy hundreds of thousands 
        of acres of trees each year;
            (B) in the West, more than 21,000,000 acres are at high risk 
        of forest-damaging insect infestation, and in the South, more 
        than 57,000,000 acres are at risk across all land ownerships; 
        and
            (C) severe drought conditions in many areas of the South and 
        West will increase the risk of forest-damaging insect 
        infestations;
            (3) the hemlock woolly adelgid is--
                    (A) destroying streamside forests throughout the 
                mid-Atlantic and Appalachian regions;
                    (B) threatening water quality and sensitive aquatic 
                species; and
                    (C) posing a potential threat to valuable commercial 
                timber land in northern New England;
            (4)(A) the emerald ash borer is a nonnative, invasive pest 
        that has quickly become a major threat to hardwood forests 
        because an emerald ash borer infestation is almost always fatal 
        to affected trees; and
            (B) the emerald ash borer pest threatens to destroy more 
        than 692,000,000 ash trees in forests in Michigan and Ohio 
        alone, and between 5 and 10 percent of urban street trees in the 
        Upper Midwest;

[[Page 117 STAT. 1908]]

            (5)(A) epidemic populations of Southern pine beetles are 
        ravaging forests in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, 
        Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
        Tennessee, and Virginia; and
            (B) in 2001, Florida and Kentucky experienced 146 percent 
        and 111 percent increases, respectively, in Southern pine beetle 
        populations;
            (6) those epidemic outbreaks of Southern pine beetles have 
        forced private landowners to harvest dead and dying trees, in 
        rural areas and increasingly urbanized settings;
            (7) according to the Forest Service, recent outbreaks of the 
        red oak borer in Arkansas and Missouri have been unprecedented, 
        with more than 1,000,000 acres infested at population levels 
        never seen before;
            (8) much of the damage from the red oak borer has taken 
        place in national forests, and the Federal response has been 
        inadequate to protect forest ecosystems and other ecological and 
        economic resources;
            (9)(A) previous silvicultural assessments, while useful and 
        informative, have been limited in scale and scope of 
        application; and
            (B) there have not been sufficient resources available to 
        adequately test a full array of individual and combined applied 
        silvicultural assessments;
            (10) only through the full funding, development, and 
        assessment of potential applied silvicultural assessments over 
        specific time frames across an array of environmental and 
        climatic conditions can the most innovative and cost effective 
        management applications be determined that will help reduce the 
        susceptibility of forest ecosystems to attack by forest pests;
            (11)(A) often, there are significant interactions between 
        insects and diseases;
            (B) many diseases (such as white pine blister rust, beech 
        bark disease, and many other diseases) can weaken trees and 
        forest stands and predispose trees and forest stands to insect 
        attack; and
            (C) certain diseases are spread using insects as vectors 
        (including Dutch elm disease and pine pitch canker); and
            (12) funding and implementation of an initiative to combat 
        forest pest infestations and associated diseases should not come 
        at the expense of supporting other programs and initiatives of 
        the Secretary.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to require the Secretary to develop an accelerated basic 
        and applied assessment program to combat infestations by forest-
        damaging insects and associated diseases;
            (2) to enlist the assistance of colleges and universities 
        (including forestry schools, land grant colleges and 
        universities, and 1890 Institutions), State agencies, and 
        private landowners to carry out the program; and
            (3) to carry out applied silvicultural assessments.

            RESERVE PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall establish the 
healthy forests reserve program for the purpose of restoring and 
enhancing forest ecosystems--
            (1) to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered 
        species;
            (2) to improve biodiversity; and
            (3) to enhance carbon sequestration.

    (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall carry out the 
healthy forests reserve program in coordination with the Secretary of 
the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 16 USC 6572.>> ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT OF LANDS IN 
            PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with

describe and define forest ecosystems that are eligible for enrollment 
in the healthy forests reserve program.
    (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible for enrollment in the healthy 
forests reserve program, land shall be--
            (1) private land the enrollment of which will restore, 
        enhance, or otherwise measurably increase the likelihood of 
        recovery of a species listed as endangered or threatened under 
        section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1533); and

[[Page 117 STAT. 1912]]

            (2) private land the enrollment of which will restore, 
        enhance, or otherwise measurably improve the well-being of 
        species that--
                    (A) are not listed as endangered or threatened under 
                section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
                U.S.C. 1533); but
                    (B) are candidates for such listing, State-listed 
                species, or special concern species.

    (c) Other Considerations.--In enrolling land that satisfies the 
criteria under subsection (b), the Secretary of Agriculture shall give 
additional consideration to land the enrollment of which will--
            (1) improve biological diversity; and
