    ``(c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience 
        and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate 
        in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for 
        children with disabilities is an essential element of our 
        national

[[Page 118 STAT. 2649]]

        policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, 
        independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for 
        individuals with disabilities.
            ``(2) Before the date of enactment of the Education for All 
        Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), the 
        educational needs of millions of children with disabilities were 
        not being fully met because--
                    ``(A) the children did not receive appropriate 
                educational services;
                    ``(B) the children were excluded entirely from the 
                public school system and from being educated with their 
                peers;
                    ``(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the 
                children from having a successful educational 
                experience; or
                    ``(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public 
                school system forced families to find services outside 
                the public school system.
            ``(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the 
        Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this title 
        has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and 
        the families of such children access to a free appropriate 
        public education and in improving educational results for 
        children with disabilities.
            ``(4) However, the implementation of this title has been 
        impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on 
        applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and 
        learning for children with disabilities.
            ``(5) Almost 30 years of research and experience has 
        demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities 
        can be made more effective by--
                    ``(A) having high expectations for such children and 
                ensuring their access to the general education 
                curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum 
                extent possible, in order to--
                          ``(i) meet developmental goals and, to the 
                      maximum extent possible, the challenging 
                      expectations that have been established for all 
                      children; and
                          ``(ii) be prepared to lead productive and 
                      independent adult lives, to the maximum extent 
                      possible;
                    ``(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of 
                parents and ensuring that families of such children have 
                meaningful opportunities to participate in the education 
                of their children at school and at home;
                    ``(C) coordinating this title with other local, 
                educational service agency, State, and Federal school 
                improvement efforts, including improvement efforts under 
                the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, in 
                order to ensure that such children benefit from such 
                efforts and that special education can become a service 
                for such children rather than a place where such 
                children are sent;
                    ``(D) providing appropriate special education and 
                related services, and aids and supports in the regular 
                classroom, to such children, whenever appropriate;
                    ``(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice 
                preparation and professional development for all 
                personnel who work with children with disabilities in 
                order to ensure that such personnel have the skills and 
                knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement 
                and functional

                performance of children with disabilities, including the 
                use of scientifically based instructional practices, to 
                the maximum extent possible;
                    ``(F) providing incentives for whole-school 
                approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, 
                positive behavioral interventions and supports, and 
                early intervening services to reduce the need to label 
                children as disabled in order to address the learning 
                and behavioral needs of such children;
                    ``(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning 
                while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not 
                assist in improving educational results; and
                    ``(H) supporting the development and use of 
                technology, including assistive technology devices and 
                assistive technology services, to maximize accessibility 
                for children with disabilities.
            ``(6) While States, local educational agencies, and 
        educational service agencies are primarily responsible for 
        providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is 
        in the national interest that the Federal Government have a 
        supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate 
        children with disabilities in order to improve results for such 
        children and to ensure equal protection of the law.
            ``(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential 
        for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide 
        an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.
            ``(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded 
        opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and 
        constructive ways.
            ``(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and 
        States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary 
        paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational 
        outcomes.
            ``(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the 
        growing needs of an increasingly diverse society.
            ``(B) America's ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In 2000, 
        1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a member of a 
        minority group or was limited English proficient.
            ``(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage of 
        public school students.
            ``(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts 
        for special education personnel should focus on increasing the 
        participation of minorities in the teaching profession in order 
        to provide appropriate role models with sufficient knowledge to 
        address the special education needs of these students.
            ``(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the 
        fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in 
        many parts of our Nation.
            ``(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the 
        levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient 
        children in special education.
            ``(C) Such discrepancies pose a special challenge for 
        special education in the referral of, assessment of, and 
        provision of services for, our Nation's students from non-
        English language backgrounds.

[[Page 118 STAT. 2651]]

            ``(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the 
        intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high 
        dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.
            ``(B) More minority children continue to be served in 
        special education than would be expected from the percentage of 
        minority students in the general school population.
            ``(C) African-American children are identified as having 
        mental retardation and emotional disturbance at rates greater 
        than their White counterparts.
            ``(D) In the 1998-1999 school year, African-American 
        children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged 6 
        through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with 
        disabilities.
            ``(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately 
        White students and teachers have placed disproportionately high 
        numbers of their minority students into special education.
            ``(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special 
        education increases, the number of minority teachers and related 
        services personnel produced in colleges and universities 
        continues to decrease.
            ``(B) The opportunity for full participation by minority 
        individuals, minority organizations, and Historically Black 
        Colleges and Universities in awards for grants and contracts, 
        boards of organizations receiving assistance under this title, 
        peer review panels, and training of professionals in the area of 
        special education is essential to obtain greater success in the 
        education of minority children with disabilities.
            ``(14) As the graduation rates for children with 
        disabilities continue to climb, providing effective transition 
        services to promote successful post-school employment or 
        education is an important measure of accountability for children 
        with disabilities.

    ``(d) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            ``(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have 
        available to them a free appropriate public education that 
        emphasizes special education and related services designed to 
        meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, 
        employment, and independent living;
            ``(B) to ensure that the rights of children with 
        disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and
            ``(C) to assist States, localities, educational service 
        agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of 
        all children with disabilities;

        comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency 
        system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers 
        with disabilities and their families;
            ``(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the 
        necessary tools to improve educational results for children with 
        disabilities by supporting system improvement activities; 
        coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated 
        technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology 
        development and media services; and

educational agency include in the records of a child with a disability a 
statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that has been 
taken against the child and transmit such statement to the same extent 
that such disciplinary information is included in, and transmitted with, 
the student records of nondisabled children. The statement may include a 
description of any behavior engaged in by the child that required 
disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action taken, and 
any other information that is relevant to the safety of the child and 
other individuals involved with the child. If the State adopts such a 
policy, and the child transfers from 1 school to another, the 
transmission of any of the child's records shall include both the 
child's current individualized education program and any such statement 
of current or previous disciplinary action that has been taken against

            ``PART C--INFANTS AND TODDLERS WITH DISABILITIES

``SEC. 631. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1431.>> FINDINGS AND POLICY.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that there is an urgent and 
substantial need--
            ``(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers 
        with disabilities, to minimize their potential for developmental 
        delay, and to recognize the significant brain development that 
        occurs during a child's first 3 years of life;
            ``(2) to reduce the educational costs to our society, 
        including our Nation's schools, by minimizing the need for 
        special education and related services after infants and 
        toddlers with disabilities reach school age;
            ``(3) to maximize the potential for individuals with 
        disabilities to live independently in society;
            ``(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the 
        special needs of their infants and toddlers with disabilities; 
        and
            ``(5) to enhance the capacity of State and local agencies 
        and service providers to identify, evaluate, and meet the needs 
        of all children, particularly minority, low-income, inner city, 
        and rural children, and infants and toddlers in foster care.

    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to provide 
financial assistance to States--
            ``(1) to develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, 
        coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system that provides 
        early intervention services for infants and toddlers with 
        disabilities and their families;
            ``(2) to facilitate the coordination of payment for early 
        intervention services from Federal, State, local, and private 
        sources (including public and private insurance coverage);
            ``(3) to enhance State capacity to provide quality early 
        intervention services and expand and improve existing early 
        intervention services being provided to infants and toddlers 
        with disabilities and their families; and
            ``(4) to encourage States to expand opportunities for 
        children under 3 years of age who would be at risk of having 
        substantial developmental delay if they did not receive early 
        intervention services.
