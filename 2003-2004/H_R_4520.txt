        demonstrate that the assessment applicable to the manufacturer 
        or importer is incorrect. In challenging the assessment, the

                sufficient to establish that the original assessment was 
                incorrect; and
                    (B) make any revisions necessary to ensure that each 
                manufacturer and importer pays only its correct pro rata 
                share of total gross domestic volume from all sources.
            (5) Immediate payment of undisputed amounts.--The 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary under paragraph (2) 
        shall provide for the immediate payment by a manufacturer or

        exhausted if no decision by the Secretary is made within the 
        time limits established under subsection (i)(4).
            (3) Excessive assessments.--The court shall restrain 
        collection of the excessive portion of any assessment or order a 
        refund of excessive assessments already paid, along with 
        interest calculated at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of 
        title 31, United States Code, if it finds that the Secretary's

SEC. 852. MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE.

    (a) In General.--Section 7701(a) (relating to definitions) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(48) Off-highway vehicles.--
                    ``(A) Off-highway transportation vehicles.--
                          ``(i) In general.--A vehicle shall not be 
                      treated as a highway vehicle if such vehicle is 
                      specially designed for the primary function of 
                      transporting a particular type of load other than 
                      over the public highway and because of this 
                      special design such vehicle's capability to 
                      transport a load over the public highway is 
                      substantially limited or impaired.
                          ``(ii) Determination of vehicle's design.--For 
                      purposes of clause (i), a vehicle's design is 
                      determined solely on the basis of its physical 
                      characteristics.

                      limitation or impairment.--For purposes of clause 
                      (i), in determining whether substantial limitation 
                      or impairment exists, account may be taken of 
                      factors such as the size of the vehicle, whether 
                      such vehicle is subject to the licensing, safety, 
                      and other requirements applicable to highway 
                      vehicles, and whether such vehicle can transport a 
                      load at a sustained speed of at least 25 miles per 
                      hour. It is immaterial that a vehicle can 
                      transport a greater load off the public highway 
                      than such vehicle is permitted to transport over 
                      the public highway.
                    ``(B) Nontransportation trailers and semitrailers.--
                A trailer or semitrailer shall not be treated as a 
                highway vehicle if it is specially designed to function 
                only as an enclosed stationary shelter for the carrying 
                on of an off-highway function at an off-highway site.''.

        subchapter B of chapter 31 and part III of subchapter A of 
        chapter 32, the amendment made by this section shall apply to 
        taxable periods beginning after the date of the enactment of 
        this Act.
