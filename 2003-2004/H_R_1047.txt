SEC. 1560. <<NOTE: 19 USC 1629 note.>> AUTHORITY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT 
            OF INTEGRATED BORDER INSPECTION AREAS AT THE UNITED STATES-
            CANADA BORDER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The increased security and safety concerns that 
        developed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the 
        United States on September 11, 2001, need to be addressed.
            (2) One concern that has come to light is the vulnerability 
        of the international bridges and tunnels along the United States 
        borders.
            (3) It is necessary to ensure that potentially dangerous 
        vehicles are inspected prior to crossing these bridges and 
        tunnels; however, currently these vehicles are not inspected 
        until after they have crossed into the United States.
            (4) Establishing Integrated Border Inspection Areas (IBIAs) 
        would address these concerns by inspecting vehicles before they 
        gained access to the infrastructure of international bridges and 
        tunnels joining the United States and Canada.

    (b) Creation of Integrated Border Inspection Areas.--

[[Page 118 STAT. 2581]]

            (1) In general.--The Commissioner of the Customs Service, in 
        consultation with the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency 
        (CCRA), shall seek to establish Integrated Border Inspection 
        Areas (IBIAs), such as areas on either side of the United 
        States-Canada border, in which United States Customs officers 
        can inspect vehicles entering the United States from Canada 
        before they enter the United States, or Canadian Customs 
        officers can inspect vehicles entering Canada from the United 
        States before they enter Canada. Such inspections may include, 
        where appropriate, employment of reverse inspection techniques.
            (2) Additional requirement.--The Commissioner of Customs, in 
        consultation with the Administrator of the General Services 
        Administration when appropriate, shall seek to carry out 
        paragraph (1) in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on the 
        surrounding community.
            (3) Elements of the program.--Using the authority granted by 
        this section and under section 629 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
        the Commissioner of Customs, in consultation with the Canadian 
        Customs and Revenue Agency, shall seek to--
                    (A) locate Integrated Border Inspection Areas in 
                areas with bridges or tunnels with high traffic volume, 
                significant commercial activity, and that have 
                experienced backups and delays since September 11, 2001;
                    (B) ensure that United States Customs officers 
                stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of the 
                border are vested with the maximum authority to carry 
                out their duties and enforce United States law;
                    (C) ensure that United States Customs officers 
                stationed in any such IBIA on the Canadian side of the 
                border shall possess the same immunity that they would 
                possess if they were stationed in the United States; and
                    (D) encourage appropriate officials of the United 
                States to enter into an agreement with Canada permitting 
                Canadian Customs officers stationed in any such IBIA on 
                the United States side of the border to enjoy such 
                immunities as permitted in Canada.

SEC. 1561. DESIGNATION OF FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

    (a) Miscellaneous Provisions.--Section 401(i) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401(i)) is amended by inserting ``, including foreign

of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1629) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or subsequent to 
        their exit from,'' after ``prior to their arrival in'';
            (2) in subsection (c)--
                    (A) by inserting ``or exportation'' after ``relating 
                to the importation''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``or exit'' after ``port of 
                entry'';
            (3) by amending subsection (e) to read as follows:

    ``(e) Stationing of Foreign Customs and Agriculture Inspection 
Officers in the United States.--The Secretary of State, in coordination 
with the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture, may enter into 
agreements with any foreign country authorizing the stationing in the 
United States of customs and

[[Page 118 STAT. 2582]]

agriculture inspection officials of that country (if similar privileges 
are extended by that country to United States officials) for the purpose 
of insuring that persons and merchandise going directly to that country 
from the United States, or that have gone directly from that country to 
the United States, comply with the customs and other laws of that 
country governing the importation or exportation of merchandise. Any 
foreign customs or agriculture inspection official stationed in the 
United States under this subsection may exercise such functions, perform 
such duties, and enjoy such privileges and immunities as United States 
officials may be authorized to perform or are afforded in that foreign 
country by treaty, agreement, or law.''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:

401(i) of this Act shall be entitled to the same privileges and 
immunities as an officer of the Customs Service with respect to any 
actions taken by the designated person in the performance of such 
duties.''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 127 of the Treasury Department 
Appropriations Act, 2003, <<NOTE: 19 USC 1401, 1629 and note.>> is 
hereby repealed.

    (d) Effective Date.--This <<NOTE: 19 USC 1401 note.>> section, and 
the amendments made by this section, take effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act.

        rates set forth in column 1 under this chapter that were in 
        effect for such preceding calendar year.''; and
            (2) by amending subparagraph (v) to read as follows:

``(v) Any certificate issued under subparagraph (i) shall entitle the 
certificate holder to secure a refund of duties equal to the face value 
of the certificate on any articles that are imported into the customs 
territory of the United States by the certificate holder. Such refunds

SEC. 2005. EXTENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS TO LAOS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Lao People's Democratic Republic is pursuing a broad 
        policy of adopting market-based reforms to enhance its economic 
        competitiveness and achieve an attractive climate for 
        investment;
            (2) extension of normal trade relations treatment would 
        assist the Lao People's Democratic Republic in developing its 
        economy based on free market principles and becoming competitive 
        in the global marketplace;
            (3) establishing normal commercial relations on a reciprocal 
        basis with the Lao People's Democratic Republic will promote 
        United States exports to the rapidly growing southeast Asian 
        region and expand opportunities for United States business and 
        investment in the Lao People's Democratic Republic economy;
            (4) United States and Laotian commercial interests would 
        benefit from the bilateral trade agreement between the United 
        States and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, signed in 2003, 
        providing for market access and the protection of intellectual 
        property rights;
            (5) the Lao People's Democratic Republic has taken 
        cooperative steps with the United States in the global war on 
        terrorism, combating the trafficking of narcotics, and the 
        accounting for American servicemen and civilians still missing 
        from the Vietnam war; and
            (6) expanding bilateral trade relations that include a 
        commercial agreement may promote further progress by the Lao 
        People's Democratic Republic on human rights, religious 
        tolerance, democratic rule, and transparency, and assist that 
        country in adopting regional and world trading rules and 
        principles.

Lao People's Democratic Republic.--

        published in the Federal Register by the United States Trade 
        Representative that a trade agreement obligating reciprocal 
        most-favored-nation treatment between the Lao People's
