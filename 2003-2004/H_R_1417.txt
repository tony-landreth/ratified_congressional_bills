            ``(1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable 
        terms and rates of royalty payments as provided in sections 
        112(e), 114, 115, 116, 118, 119 and 1004. The rates applicable

                for his or her creative work and the copyright user a 
                fair income under existing economic conditions.
                    ``(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright 
                owner and the copyright user in the product made 
                available to the public with respect to relative 
                creative contribution, technological contribution, 
                capital investment, cost, risk, and contribution to the 
                opening of new markets for creative expression and media 
                for their communication.
                    ``(D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the 
                structure of the industries involved and on generally 
                prevailing industry practices.
            ``(2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of 
        the copyright royalty rates under section 111 solely in 
        accordance with the following provisions:
                    ``(A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) 
                may be adjusted to reflect--
                          ``(i) national monetary inflation or 
                      deflation; or
                          ``(ii) changes in the average rates charged 
                      cable subscribers for the basic service of 
                      providing secondary transmissions to maintain the 
                      real constant dollar level of the royalty fee per 
                      subscriber which existed as of the date of October 
                      19, 1976,
                except that--
                          ``(I) if the average rates charged cable 
                      system subscribers for the basic service of 
                      providing secondary transmissions are changed so 
                      that the average rates exceed national monetary 
                      inflation, no change in the rates established by 
                      section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and
                          ``(II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be 
                      permitted based on any reduction in the average 
                      number of distant signal equivalents per 
                      subscriber.
                The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors 
                relating to the maintenance of such level of payments, 
                including, as an extenuating factor, whether the 
                industry has been restrained by subscriber rate 
                regulating authorities from increasing the rates for the 
                basic service of providing secondary transmissions.
                    ``(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of 
                the Federal Communications Commission are amended at any 
                time after April 15, 1976, to permit the carriage by 
                cable systems of additional television broadcast signals 
                beyond the local service area of the primary 
                transmitters of such signals, the royalty rates 
                established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to 
                ensure that the rates for the additional distant signal 
                equivalents resulting from such carriage are reasonable 
                in the light of the changes effected by the amendment to 
                such rules and regulations. In determining the 
                reasonableness of rates proposed following an amendment 
                of Federal Communications Commission rules and 
                regulations, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall 
                consider, among other factors, the economic impact on 
                copyright owners and users; except that no adjustment in 
                royalty rates shall be made under this subparagraph with 
                respect to any distant signal equivalent or fraction 
                thereof represented by--

                by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be adjusted to assure that 
                such rates are reasonable in light of the changes to 
                such rules and regulations, but any such adjustment 
                shall apply only to the affected television broadcast 
                signals carried on those systems affected by the change.

                subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary
