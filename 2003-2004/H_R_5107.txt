    ``(a) Rights of Crime Victims.--A crime victim has the following 
rights:
            ``(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
            ``(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice 
        of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, 
        involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused.
            ``(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public 
        court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and 
        convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim 
        would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony 
        at that proceeding.
            ``(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public 
        proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, 
        sentencing, or any parole proceeding.
            ``(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for 
        the Government in the case.
            ``(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided 
        in law.
            ``(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.
            ``(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect 
        for the victim's dignity and privacy.

[[Page 118 STAT. 2262]]

    ``(b) Rights Afforded.--In any court proceeding involving an offense 
against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is 
afforded the rights described in subsection (a). Before making a 
determination described in subsection (a)(3), the court shall make every 
effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall 
consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the 
criminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision denying relief under 
this chapter shall be clearly stated on the record.
    ``(c) Best Efforts To Accord Rights.--
            ``(1) Government.--Officers <<NOTE: Notification.>> and 
        employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and 
        agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, 
        investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best 
        efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, 
        the rights described in subsection (a).
            ``(2) Advice of attorney.--The prosecutor shall advise the 
        crime victim that the crime victim can seek the advice of an 
        attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a).
            ``(3) Notice.--Notice of release otherwise required pursuant 
        to this chapter shall not be given if such notice may endanger 
        the safety of any person.

    ``(d) Enforcement and Limitations.--
            ``(1) Rights.--The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful 
        representative, and the attorney for the Government may assert 
        the rights described in subsection (a). A person accused of the 
        crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter.
            ``(2) Multiple crime victims.--In a case where the court 
        finds that the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to 
        accord all of the crime victims the rights described in 
        subsection (a), the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure 
        to give effect to this chapter that does not unduly complicate 
        or prolong the proceedings.
            ``(3) Motion for relief and writ of mandamus.--The rights 
        described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the district 
        court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, 
        if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the 
        district in which the crime occurred. The district court shall 
        take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right 
        forthwith. If the district court denies the relief sought, the 
        movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. 
        The court of appeals may issue the writ on the order of a single 
        judge pursuant to circuit rule or the Federal Rules of Appellate 
        Procedure. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The court of appeals shall take 
        up and decide such application forthwith within 72 hours after 
        the petition has been filed. In no event shall proceedings be 
        stayed or subject to a continuance of more than five days for 
        purposes of enforcing this chapter. If the court of appeals 
        denies the relief sought, the reasons for the denial shall be 
        clearly stated on the record in a written opinion.
            ``(4) Error.--In any appeal in a criminal case, the 
        Government may assert as error the district court's denial of 
        any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 
        relates.
            ``(5) Limitation on relief.--In no case shall a failure to 
        afford a right under this chapter provide grounds for a

[[Page 118 STAT. 2263]]

        new trial. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or 
        sentence only if--
                    ``(A) the victim has asserted the right to be heard 
                before or during the proceeding at issue and such right 
                was denied;
                    ``(B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for 
                a writ of mandamus within 10 days; and
                    ``(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not 
                pled to the highest offense charged.
        This paragraph does not affect the victim's right to restitution 
        as provided in title 18, United States Code.''.
            ``(6) No cause of action.--Nothing in this chapter shall be 
        construed to authorize a cause of action for damages or to 
        create, to enlarge, or to imply any duty or obligation to any 
        victim or other person for the breach of which the United States 
        or any of its officers or employees could be held liable in 
        damages. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair 
        the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any 
        officer under his direction.

    ``(e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this chapter, the term 
`crime victim' means a person directly and proximately harmed as a 
result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the 
District of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 
years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal 
guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime 
victim's estate, family members, or any other persons appointed as 
suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under this 
chapter, but in no event shall the defendant be named as such guardian 
or representative.
    ``(f) Procedures To Promote Compliance.--

        first fiscal year for which a State receives funds under a grant 
        made under this subtitle, the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the

                and conditions of the grant; and
                    (B) if the Inspector General concludes that the 
                State is not in compliance with the terms and conditions 
                of the grant, specify any deficiencies and make 
                recommendations to the Attorney General for corrective 
                action.
            (2) Priority.--In conducting evaluations under this 
        subsection, the Inspector General shall give priority to States 
        that the Inspector General determines, based on information

        person, to be at the highest risk of noncompliance.
            (3) Determination <<NOTE: Deadline.>> for statutory

        of such comments, the Inspector General shall maintain on its

        to comment regarding the findings and conclusions of the report 
        or the determination.
            (2) Corrective action plan.--If the Attorney General, after 
        reviewing a report under subsection (a)(1) or a determination

        authorities to enter into a plan for corrective 
        action. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> If the State does not agree to a

        corrective action to bring the State into compliance.

        earlier of the implementation of a corrective action plan or the 
        issuance of guidance under paragraph (2), the Attorney General 
        shall submit a report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the

        the Senate as to whether the State has taken corrective action

compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the Attorney 
General shall discontinue all further funding under sections 421 and 422

which has been subject to penalties for noncompliance from reapplying

General shall periodically review the compliance of each State with the

        determines that the State is in substantial compliance with the 
        requirements of that statute, the funds awarded under this 
        subtitle shall be allocated solely for the uses described in
