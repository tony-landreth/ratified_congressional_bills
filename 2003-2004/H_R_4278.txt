``SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 29 USC 3001.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Over 54,000,000 individuals in the United States have 
        disabilities, with almost half experiencing severe disabilities 
        that affect their ability to see, hear, communicate, reason, 
        walk, or perform other basic life functions.
            ``(2) Disability is a natural part of the human experience 
        and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--
                    ``(A) live independently;
                    ``(B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;
                    ``(C) benefit from an education;
                    ``(D) pursue meaningful careers; and
                    ``(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the 
                economic, political, social, cultural, and educational 
                mainstream of society in the United States.

[[Page 118 STAT. 1708]]

            ``(3) Technology is one of the primary engines for economic 
        activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, and 
        throughout the world. The commitment of the United States to the 
        development and utilization of technology is one of the main 
        factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the economy of 
        the United States.
            ``(4) As technology has come to play an increasingly 
        important role in the lives of all persons in the United States, 
        in the conduct of business, in the functioning of government, in 
        the fostering of communication, in the conduct of commerce, and 
        in the provision of education, its impact upon the lives of 
        individuals with disabilities in the United States has been 
        comparable to its impact upon the remainder of the citizens of 
        the United States. Any development in mainstream technology will 
        have profound implications for individuals with disabilities in 
        the United States.
            ``(5) Substantial progress has been made in the development 
        of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to 
        existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living that 
        significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of all ages. 
        These devices, including adaptations, increase involvement in, 
        and reduce expenditures associated with, programs and activities 
        that facilitate communication, ensure independent functioning, 
        enable early childhood development, support educational 
        achievement, provide and enhance employment options, and enable 
        full participation in community living for individuals with 
        disabilities. Access to such devices can also reduce 
        expenditures associated with early childhood intervention, 
        education, rehabilitation and training, health care, employment, 
        residential living, independent living, recreation 
        opportunities, and other aspects of daily living.
            ``(6) Over the last 15 years, the Federal Government has 
        invested in the development of comprehensive statewide programs 
        of technology-related assistance, which have proven effective in 
        assisting individuals with disabilities in accessing assistive 
        technology devices and assistive technology services. This 
        partnership between the Federal Government and the States 
        provided an important service to individuals with disabilities 
        by strengthening the capacity of each State to assist 
        individuals with disabilities of all ages meet their assistive 
        technology needs.
            ``(7) Despite the success of the Federal-State partnership 
        in providing access to assistive technology devices and 
        assistive technology services, there is a continued need to 
        provide information about the availability of assistive 
        technology, advances in improving accessibility and 
        functionality of assistive technology, and appropriate methods 
        to secure and utilize assistive technology in order to maximize 
        the independence and participation of individuals with 
        disabilities in society.
            ``(8) The combination of significant recent changes in 
        Federal policy (including changes to section 508 of the 
        Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), accessibility 
        provisions of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15301 
        et seq.), and the amendments made to the Elementary and 
        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) by the 
        No Child Left Behind Act of 2001) and the rapid and unending 
        evolution of technology require a Federal-State investment in

[[Page 118 STAT. 1709]]

        State assistive technology systems to continue to ensure that 
        individuals with disabilities reap the benefits of the 
        technological revolution and participate fully in life in their 
        communities.

    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            ``(1) to support State efforts to improve the provision of 
        assistive technology to individuals with disabilities through 
        comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related 
        assistance, for individuals with disabilities of all ages, that 
        are designed to--
                    ``(A) increase the availability of, funding for, 
                access to, provision of, and training about assistive 
                technology devices and assistive technology services;
                    ``(B) increase the ability of individuals with 
                disabilities of all ages to secure and maintain 
                possession of assistive technology devices as such 
                individuals make the transition between services offered 
                by educational or human service agencies or between 
                settings of daily living (for example, between home and 
                work);
                    ``(C) increase the capacity of public agencies and 
                private entities to provide and pay for assistive 
                technology devices and assistive technology services on 
                a statewide basis for individuals with disabilities of 
                all ages;
                    ``(D) increase the involvement of individuals with 
                disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, 
                guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in 
                decisions related to the provision of assistive 
                technology devices and assistive technology services;
                    ``(E) increase and promote coordination among State 
                agencies, between State and local agencies, among local 
                agencies, and between State and local agencies and 
                private entities (such as managed care providers), that 
                are involved or are eligible to be involved in carrying 
                out activities under this Act;
                    ``(F) increase the awareness and facilitate the 
                change of laws, regulations, policies, practices, 
                procedures, and organizational structures, that 
                facilitate the availability or provision of assistive 
                technology devices and assistive technology services; 
                and
                    ``(G) increase awareness and knowledge of the 
                benefits of assistive technology devices and assistive 
                technology services among targeted individuals and 
                entities and the general population; and
            ``(2) to provide States with financial assistance that 
        supports programs designed to maximize the ability of 
        individuals with disabilities and their family members, 
        guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives to obtain
