Public Law 108-391
108th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
Expressing the sense of the Congress in recognition of the contributions 
   of the seven Columbia astronauts by supporting establishment of a 
   Columbia Memorial Space Science Learning Center. <<NOTE: Oct. 30, 
                        2004 -  [H.J. Res. 57]>> 

Whereas the crew of the space shuttle Columbia was dedicated to 
    scientific research and stimulating the interest of American 
    children in space flight and science;

Whereas the Columbia crew carried out science projects of American 
    schoolchildren;

Whereas the members of that crew gave their lives trying to benefit the 
    education of American children;

Whereas a fitting tribute to that effort and to the sacrifice of the 
    Columbia crew and their families is needed;

Whereas an appropriate form for such tribute would be to expand 
    educational opportunities in science by the creation of a center and 
    museum to offer children and teachers activities and information 
    derived from American space research;

Whereas the former manufacturing site of the space shuttles (including 
    the Columbia and the Challenger) in the City of Downey, California, 
    is a fitting site for such a tribute;

Whereas residents of Downey are proud of their role in building the 
    space shuttle fleet and in furthering the Nation's space program; 
    and

Whereas city officials have been working with NASA representatives to 
    develop the center in Downey: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of the 
Congress that--
            (1) <<NOTE: California.>> the space science learning center 
        in Downey, California, should be designated as the Columbia 
        Memorial Space Science Learning Center as a living memorial to 
        the seven Columbia astronauts who died serving their country in 
        the name of science and research; and

[[Page 118 STAT. 2244]]

            (2) the Federal Government, along with public and private 
        organizations and persons, should continue to cooperate in the 
        establishment of such a center.

    Approved October 30, 2004.
