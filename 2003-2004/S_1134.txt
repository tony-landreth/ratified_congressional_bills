(42 U.S.C. 3121) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) there continue to be areas of the United States 
        experiencing chronic high unemployment, underemployment, 
        outmigration, and low per capita incomes, as well as areas 
        facing sudden and severe economic dislocations because of 
        structural economic changes, changing trade patterns, certain 
        Federal actions (including environmental requirements that 
        result in the removal of economic activities from a locality), 
        and natural disasters;
            ``(2) economic growth in the States, cities, and rural areas 
        of the United States is produced by expanding economic 
        opportunities, expanding free enterprise through trade, 
        developing and strengthening public infrastructure, and creating 
        a climate for job creation and business development;
            ``(3) the goal of Federal economic development programs is 
        to raise the standard of living for all citizens and increase 
        the wealth and overall rate of growth of the economy by 
        encouraging communities to develop a more competitive and 
        diversified economic base by--
                    ``(A) creating an environment that promotes economic 
                activity by improving and expanding public 
                infrastructure;
                    ``(B) promoting job creation through increased 
                innovation, productivity, and entrepreneurship; and
                    ``(C) empowering local and regional communities 
                experiencing chronic high unemployment and low per 
                capita income to develop private sector business and 
                attract increased private sector capital investment;
            ``(4) while economic development is an inherently local 
        process, the Federal Government should work in partnership with 
        public and private State, regional, tribal, and local 
        organizations to maximize the impact of existing resources and 
        enable regions, communities, and citizens to participate more 
        fully in the American dream and national prosperity;
            ``(5) in order to avoid duplication of effort and achieve 
        meaningful, long-lasting results, Federal, State, tribal, and 
        local economic development activities should have a clear focus, 
        improved coordination, a comprehensive approach, and simplified 
        and consistent requirements; and
            ``(6) Federal economic development efforts will be more 
        effective if the efforts are coordinated with, and build upon, 
        the trade, workforce investment, transportation, and technology 
        programs of the United States.

[[Page 118 STAT. 1758]]

    ``(b) Declarations.--In order to promote a strong and growing 
economy throughout the United States, Congress declares that--
            ``(1) assistance under this Act should be made available to 
        both rural- and urban-distressed communities;
            ``(2) local communities should work in partnership with 
        neighboring communities, the States, Indian tribes, and the 
        Federal Government to increase the capacity of the local 
        communities to develop and implement comprehensive economic 
        development strategies to alleviate economic distress and 
        enhance competitiveness in the global economy;
            ``(3) whether suffering from long-term distress or a sudden 
        dislocation, distressed communities should be encouraged to 
        support entrepreneurship to take advantage of the development 
        opportunities afforded by technological innovation and expanding 
        newly opened global markets; and
            ``(4) assistance under this Act should be made available to 
        promote the productive reuse of abandoned industrial facilities 
        and the redevelopment of brownfields.''.

SEC. 605. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
            REPRESENTATIVES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) planning and coordination among Federal agencies, State 
        and local governments, Indian tribes, and economic development 
        districts is vital to the success of an economic development 
        program;
            (2) economic development representatives of the Economic 
        Development Administration provide distressed communities with 
        the technical assistance necessary to foster this planning and 
        coordination; and
            (3) in the 5 years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        Act, the number of economic development representatives has 
        declined by almost 25 percent.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary should maintain a sufficient number of economic development 
representatives to ensure that the Economic Development Administration 
is able to provide effective assistance to distressed communities and 
foster economic growth and development among the States.
