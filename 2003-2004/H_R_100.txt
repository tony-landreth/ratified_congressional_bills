        action, the court is unable to determine whether the defendant 
        is in military service, the court, before entering judgment, may 
        require the plaintiff to file a bond in an amount approved by

        against any loss or damage the defendant may suffer by reason of 
        any judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant, should the 
        judgment be set aside in whole or in part. The bond shall remain
