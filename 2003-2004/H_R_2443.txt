        United States Code, or a replacement vessel of a similar size 
        and function, that was issued prior to the date of enactment of 
        this Act as long as the vessel is owned by the person named 
        therein, or by a subsidiary or affiliate of that person, and the 
        controlling interest in such owner has not been transferred to a 
        person that was not an affiliate of such owner as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,

        effect on the date of enactment of this Act) with a certificate 
        of documentation endorsed with a coastwise endorsement as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act, and the Secretary of the 
        Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall revoke

                          (i) the vessel described in paragraph (1) is 
                      unavailable for more than 180 days due to an act 
                      of God or a marine casualty; or
                          (ii) a contract to purchase or construct such

person that owns the vessel (or, if the vessel is owned by a trust or 
similar arrangement, the beneficiary of the trust or similar 
arrangement) notifies the Secretary that circumstances beyond the direct 
control of such person or its affiliates prevent, or reasonably threaten 
to prevent, such person from satisfying such requirement, and the 
Secretary does not, with good cause, determine 
otherwise. <<NOTE: Applicability.>> The waiver or reduction shall apply 
during the period of time that such circumstances exist.

    (e) Regulations.--No <<NOTE: Deadline. 46 USC 12106 note.>> later 
than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall prescribe

        posed to boaters by elevated levels of carbon monoxide that are 
        unique to watercraft; and

        American Boat & Yacht Council, other Federal agencies, and the 
        entire boating community in order to determine the best ways to 
        adequately address this public safety issue and minimize the

is any violation of the Act of June 19, 1886 (chapter 421; 46 App. 
U.S.C. 289), occurring before April 1, 2003, and consisting of operation 
of a passenger vessel in transporting passengers between the Port of New

violation of that Act by a vessel described in subsection (b), that was 
committed when that vessel was repositioning to the Port of New Orleans

the purpose of permit allocation regulations under section 3(h) of 
Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-2(h)) and section 3 of the Act of August 
25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 3), with respect to vessel operations in Glacier Bay 
National Park and Preserve, Alaska (in this section referred to as 
``Glacier Bay''), if the Secretary of the department in which the Coast

        blackwater to be stored on board for at least 24 hours;
            (2) has a draft of not greater than 15 feet;

        Secretary of the Interior, upon application by the operator of a 
        passenger vessel deemed to be a tour vessel under subsection 
        (a), shall reallocate to that vessel any available tour vessel 
        concession permit not used by another vessel, if at the time of 
        application that permit is not sought by a tour vessel of less 
        than 100 gross tons.
            (2) Limitations.--No more than three passenger vessels that 
        are deemed to be a tour vessel under subsection (a) may hold a 
        tour vessel concession permit at any given time, and no more 
        than one such vessel may enter Glacier Bay on any particular 
        date.

    (c) Compliance With Vessel Requirements.--
            (1) Requirement to comply.--Except as otherwise provided in 
        this section, a vessel reallocated a tour vessel concession 
        permit under this section shall comply with all regulations and 
        requirements for Glacier Bay applicable to vessels of at least 
        100 gross tons.
            (2) Revocation of permit.--The Secretary of the Interior may 
        revoke a tour vessel concession permit reallocated to a vessel 
        under this section if that vessel--
                    (A) discharges graywater or blackwater in Glacier 
                Bay; or

[[Page 118 STAT. 1062]]

                    (B) violates a vessel operating requirement for 
                Glacier Bay that applies to vessels that are at least 
                100 gross tons, including restrictions pertaining to 
                speed, route, and closed waters.

    (d) Treatment of Entries Into Glacier Bay.--An entry into Glacier 
Bay by a vessel reallocated a tour vessel concession permit under this 
section shall count against the daily vessel quota and seasonal-use days 
applicable to entries by tour vessels and shall not count against the 
daily vessel quota or seasonal-use days of any other class of vessel.

SEC. 617. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TIMELY REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT OF 
            GREAT LAKES PILOTAGE RATES.

            (2) the sources of information, and the quality of the 
        information at the time of reporting, used by the system to 
        determine whether targeting information is collected from the 
        best and most credible sources and evaluate data sources to 
        determine information gaps and weaknesses;
            (3) the targeting system for reporting and analyzing 
        inspection statistics, as well as testing effectiveness;
            (4) the competence and training of employees operating the

which the Coast Guard is operating determines in any of the reports 
prepared under subsection (g) that the targeting system is 
insufficiently effective as a means of detecting potential acts of

Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating

[[Page 118 STAT. 1088]]

shall, within 90 days, submit a report to the Committee on Commerce,
