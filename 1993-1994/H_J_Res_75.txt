        H.J.Res.75
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
      Designating January 16, 1994, as ``National Good Teen Day''.

Whereas Salem City Schools in Salem, Ohio, have proclaimed January 16, 
  1992, as ``Good Teen Day'';
Whereas there are more than twenty-four million teenagers in the United 
  States according to the 1990 Census;
Whereas our Nation's teenagers represent an important part of our 
  society, and the many physical and emotional changes and character-
  building experiences which teenagers go through are an important 
  concern;
Whereas it is easy to stereotype teenagers as either those who have 
  problems or those who excel;
Whereas teenagers should not simply be recognized for their 
  intelligence, abilities, skills and talents, but rather for the good 
  which is inherent in all human beings;
Whereas as unique individuals, teenagers are encouraged to esteem the 
  good as well as the potential that is within each of them;
Whereas a day should be created to focus on the positive qualities in 
  America's youth; and
Whereas teenagers are the future of this great country: Now, therefore, 
  be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That January 16, 1994, is 
designated as ``National Good Teen Day'', and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people 
of the United States to observe such day by recognizing the teenagers of 
the United States and by participating in appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
