  preserve the lives and protect the property of others;
Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of valiant firefighters often 
  go unreported and are inadequately recognized by the public; and
Whereas the work of firefighters deserves the attention and gratitude of 
  all individuals in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Decem-P ber 15, 1993, is

United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe the day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
