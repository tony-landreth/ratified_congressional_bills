                            Joint Resolution


 
       Designating January 16, 1994, as ``Religious Freedom Day''.

Whereas December 15, 1991, is the 200th anniversary of the completion of 
  the ratification of the Bill of Rights;
Whereas the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
  guarantees religious liberty to the people of the United States;
Whereas millions of people from all parts of the world have come to the 
  United States fleeing religious persecution and seeking to worship;
Whereas in 1777 Thomas Jefferson wrote the bill entitled ``A Bill for 
  Establishing Religious Freed in Virginia'' to guarantee freedom of 
  conscience and separation of church and State;
Whereas in 1786, through the devotion of Virginians such as George Mason 
  and James Madison, the General Assembly of Virginia passed such bill;
Whereas the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom inspired and 
  shaped the guarantee of religious freedom in the first amendment;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized repeatedly 
  that the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom was an important 
  influence in the development of the Bill of Rights;
Whereas scholars across the United States have proclaimed the vital 
  importance of such statute and leader in fields such as law and 
  religion have devoted time, energy and resources to celebrating its 
  contribution to international freedom; and
Whereas America's First Freedom Center, located in Richmond, Virginia, 
  plans a permanent monument to the Statute of Religious Freedom, 
  accompanied by educational programs and commemorative activities for 
  visitors from around the world: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That January 16, 1994, is 
designated as ``Religious Freedom Day'', and the President is authorized 
and requested to issue a proclamation calling
on the people of the United States to join together to celebrate their 
religious freedom and to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
