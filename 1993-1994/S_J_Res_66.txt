                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,

                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate the weeks beginning April 18, 1993, and April 17, 1994, 
each as

``Nancy Moore Thurmond National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week''.

Whereas a new patient is added to the national patient waiting list for 
  an organ transplant every 20 minutes;
Whereas thousands of lives are saved or significantly improved annually 
  by organ and tissue transplantation; and
Whereas increasing the number of transplantable organs and tissues would 
  save American taxpayers millions of dollars: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the weeks beginning April 
18, 1993, and April 17, 1994, are each designated ``Nancy Moore Thurmond 
National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week'', and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people 
of the United States to observe such weeks with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
