SEC. 108. CONGRESSIONAL INTENT REGARDING FUTURE ACCESSIONS.

    (a) In General.--Section 101(a) may not be construed as conferring 
Congressional approval of the entry into force of the Agreement for the 
United States with respect to countries other than Canada and Mexico.
    (b) Future Free Trade Area Negotiations.--
        (1) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (A) Efforts by the United States to obtain greater market 
        opening through multilateral negotiations have not produced 
        agreements that fully satisfy the trade negotiating objectives 
        of the United States.
            (B) United States trade policy should provide for additional 
        mechanisms with which to pursue greater market access for United 
        States exports of goods and services and opportunities for 
        export-related investment by United States persons.
            (C) Among the additional mechanisms should be a system of 
        bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that provide greater 
        market access for United States exports and opportunities for 
        export-related investment by United States persons.
            (D) The system of trade agreements can and should be 
        structured to be consistent with, and complementary to, existing 
        international obligations of the United States and ongoing 
        multilateral efforts to open markets.
        (2) Report on significant market opening.--No later than May 1, 
    1994, and May 1, 1997, the Trade Representative shall submit to the 
    President, and to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the 
    Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives 
    (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``appropriate 
    Congressional committees''), a report which lists those foreign 
    countries--
            (A) that--
                (i) currently provide fair and equitable market access 
            for United States exports of goods and services and 
            opportunities for export-related investment by United States 
            persons, beyond what is required by existing multilateral 
            trade agreements or obligations; or
                (ii) have made significant progress in opening their 
            markets to United States exports of goods and services and 
            export-related investment by United States persons; and
            (B) the further opening of whose markets has the greatest 
        potential to increase United States exports of goods and 
        services and export-related investment by United States persons, 
        either directly or through the establishment of a beneficial 
        precedent.
        (3) Presidential determination.--The President, on the basis of 
    the report submitted by the Trade Representative under paragraph 
    (2), shall determine with which foreign country or countries, if 
    any, the United States should seek to negotiate a free trade area 
    agreement or agreements.
        (4) Recommendations on future free trade area negotiations.--No 
    later than July 1, 1994, and July 1, 1997, the President shall 
    submit to the appropriate Congressional committees a written report 
    that contains--
            (A) recommendations for free trade area negotiations with 
        each foreign country selected under paragraph (3);
            (B) with respect to each country selected, the specific 
        negotiating objectives that are necessary to meet the objectives 
        of the United States under this section; and
            (C) legislative proposals to ensure adequate consultation 
        with the Congress and the private sector during the 
        negotiations, advance Congressional approval of the negotiations 
        recommended by the President, and Congressional approval of any 
        trade agreement entered into by the President as a result of the 
        negotiations.
        (5) General negotiating objectives.--The general negotiating 
    objectives of the United States under this section are to obtain--
            (A) preferential treatment for United States goods;
            (B) national treatment and, where appropriate, equivalent 
        competitive opportunity for United States services and foreign 
        direct investment by United States persons;
            (C) the elimination of barriers to trade in goods and 
        services by United States persons through standards, testing, 
        labeling, and certification requirements;
            (D) nondiscriminatory government procurement policies and 
        practices with respect to United States goods and services;
            (E) the elimination of other barriers to market access for 
        United States goods and services, and the elimination of 
        barriers to foreign direct investment by United States persons;
            (F) the elimination of acts, policies, and practices which 
        deny fair and equitable market opportunities, including foreign 
        government toleration of anticompetitive business practices by 
        private firms or among private firms that have the effect of 
        restricting, on a basis that is inconsistent with commercial 
        considerations, purchasing by such firms of United States goods 
        and services;
            (G) adequate and effective protection of intellectual 
        property rights of United States persons, and fair and equitable 
        market access for United States persons that rely upon 
        intellectual property protection;
            (H) the elimination of foreign export and domestic subsidies 
        that distort international trade in United States goods and 
        services or cause material injury to United States industries;
            (I) the elimination of all export taxes;
            (J) the elimination of acts, policies, and practices which 
        constitute export targeting; and

    purposes of calculating the regional value-content of the good under 
    paragraph (2) or (3), include the value of nonoriginating materials 
    used to produce originating materials that are subsequently used in 
    the production of the good.
        (5) Net cost method must be used in certain cases.--An exporter

        and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing 
        costs, and nonallowable interest costs that are included in the 
        portion of the total cost allocated to the good; or
            (C) reasonably allocating each cost that is part of the 
        total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the 
        aggregate of these costs does not include any sales promotion, 
        marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and 
        packing costs, or nonallowable interest costs.
        (9) Value of material used in production.--Except as provided in

    United States, and entered on or after January 1, 1989, and before 
    the date of entry into force of the Agreement between the United 
    States and Canada, an importer may elect to use the rules of origin 
    set out in this section in lieu of the rules of origin contained in 
    section 202 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement 
    Implementation Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note) and may elect to 
    use the method for calculating the value of nonoriginating materials 
    established in article 403(2) of the Agreement in lieu of the method 
    established in article 403(1) of the Agreement for purposes of 
    determining eligibility for preferential duty treatment under the 
    United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Any election under this 
    paragraph shall be made in writing to the Customs Service not later

    the Agreement between the United States and Canada. Any such 
    election may be made only if the liquidation of such entry has not 
    become final. For purposes of averaging the calculation of regional 
    value-content for the goods covered by such entry, where the 
    producer's 1989-1990 fiscal year began after January 1, 1989, the 
    producer may include the period between January 1, 1989, and the 
    beginning of its first fiscal year after January 1, 1989, as part of 
    fiscal year 1989-1990.
    (d) Accumulation.--
        (1) Determination of originating good.--For purposes of 
    determining whether a good is an originating good, the production of 
    the good in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries by 
    one or more producers shall, at the choice of the exporter or 
    producer of the good, be considered to have been performed in the 
    territory of any of the NAFTA countries by that exporter or 
    producer, if--
            (A) all nonoriginating materials used in the production of 
        the good undergo an applicable tariff classification change set 
        out in Annex 401 of the Agreement;

    treated as the production of a single producer.
    (e) De Minimis Amounts of Nonoriginating Materials.--
        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), (5), 
    and (6), a good shall be considered to be an originating good if--
            (A) the value of all nonoriginating materials used in the 
        production of the good that do not undergo an applicable change 
        in tariff classification (set out in Annex 401 of the Agreement) 
        is not more than 7 percent of the transaction value of the good, 
        adjusted to a F.O.B. basis, or
            (B) where the transaction value of the good is unacceptable 
        under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the value of all 
        such nonoriginating materials is not more than 7 percent of the 
        total cost of the good,
    provided that the good satisfies all other applicable requirements 
    of this section and, if the good is subject to a regional value-
    content requirement, the value of such nonoriginating materials is 
    taken into account in calculating the regional value-content of the 
    good.
        (2) Goods not subject to regional value-content requirement.--A 
    good that is otherwise subject to a regional value-content 
    requirement shall not be required to satisfy such requirement if--
            (A)(i) the value of all nonoriginating materials used in the 
        production of the good is not more than 7 percent of the 
        transaction value of the good, adjusted to a F.O.B. basis; or
            (ii) where the transaction value of the good is unacceptable 
        under Article 1 of the Customs Valuation Code, the value of all

    tariff classification set out in Annex 401 of the Agreement, shall 
    be considered to be a good that originates if the total weight of 
    all such fibers or yarns in that component is not more than 7 
    percent of the total weight of that component.
    (f) Fungible Goods and Materials.--For purposes of determining 
whether a good is an originating good--
        (1) if originating and nonoriginating fungible materials are 
    used in the production of the good, the determination of whether the

    determined on the basis of any of the inventory management methods 
    set out in regulations implementing this section; and

        nonoriginating materials used in the production of the good 
        undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in 
        Annex 401 of the Agreement.
        (2) Conditions.--Paragraph (1) shall apply only if--

        parts, or tools are customary for the good; and
            (C) in any case in which the good is subject to a regional 
        value-content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare 
        parts, or tools are taken into account as originating or 
        nonoriginating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the 
        regional value-content of the good.

401 of the Agreement. If the good is subject to a regional value-content 
requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers shall 
be taken into account as originating or nonoriginating materials, as the 
case may be, in calculating the regional value-content of the good.
    (j) Packing Materials and Containers for Shipment.--Packing 
materials and containers in which a good is packed for shipment shall be 
disregarded--
        (1) in determining whether the nonoriginating materials used in 
    the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff 
    classification set out in Annex 401 of the Agreement; and
        (2) in determining whether the good satisfies a regional value-
    content requirement.
    (k) Transshipment.--A good shall not be considered to be an 
originating good by reason of having undergone production that satisfies 
the requirements of subsection (a) if, subsequent to that production, 
the good undergoes further production or any other operation outside the 
territories of the NAFTA countries, other than unloading, reloading, or 
any other operation necessary to preserve it in good condition or to 
transport the good to the territory of a NAFTA country.
    (l) Nonqualifying Operations.--A good shall not be considered to be 
an originating good merely by reason of--
        (1) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not 
    materially alter the characteristics of the good; or
        (2) any production or pricing practice with respect to which it 
    may be demonstrated, by a preponderance of evidence, that the object

        upon written request by the exporter or producer of the 
        merchandise, provide to the exporter or producer a statement of 
        the basis for the decision. If the exporter or producer believes 
        that the decision is not correct, it may intervene in any 
        protest proceeding initiated by the importer of the merchandise. 
        If the importer does not file a protest with regard to the 
        decision, the exporter or producer may file a petition with the 
        Customs Service setting forth--
                ``(i) a description of the merchandise; and
                ``(ii) the basis for its claim that the merchandise

            entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, more 
            than 30 days after the date that notice of the determination 
            under this clause is published in the weekly Custom Bulletin

        denial of a petition under subparagraph (C)(ii) shall be treated 
        as if it were a denial of a petition of an interested party 
        under section 516 regarding an issue arising under any of the 
        preceding provisions of this section.''.

Secretary in accordance with Annex 311 of the Agreement are exempt from 
the marking requirements promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury 
under section 1907(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of

territory of a NAFTA country inconsistent with the provisions of the 
Agreement, or have been undervalued in a manner that may raise concerns

             PART 2--RELIEF FROM IMPORTS FROM ALL COUNTRIES

    SEC. 311. NAFTA ARTICLE IMPACT IN IMPORT RELIEF CASES UNDER THE 
      TRADE ACT OF 1974.
    (a) In General.--If, in any investigation initiated under chapter 1 
of title II of the Trade Act of 1974, the International Trade Commission 
makes an affirmative determination (or a determination which the 
President may treat as an affirmative determination under such chapter 
by reason of section 330(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930), the 
International Trade Commission shall also find (and report to the 
President at the time such injury determination is submitted to the 
President) whether--
        (1) imports of the article from a NAFTA country, considered 
    individually, account for a substantial share of total imports; and
        (2) imports of the article from a NAFTA country, considered 
    individually or, in exceptional circumstances, imports from NAFTA 
    countries considered collectively, contribute importantly to the 
    serious injury, or threat thereof, caused by imports.
    (b) Factors.--
        (1) Substantial import share.--In determining whether imports 
    from a NAFTA country, considered individually, account for a 
    substantial share of total imports, such imports normally shall not 
    be considered to account for a substantial share of total imports if 
    that country is not among the top 5 suppliers of the article subject 
    to the investigation, measured in terms of import share during the 
    most recent 3-year period.
        (2) Application of ``contribute importantly'' standard.--In 
    determining whether imports from a NAFTA country or countries 
    contribute importantly to the serious injury, or threat thereof, the 
    International Trade Commission shall consider such factors as the 
    change in the import share of the NAFTA country or countries, and 
    the level and change in the level of imports of such country or 
    countries. In applying the preceding sentence, imports from a NAFTA 
    country or countries normally shall not be considered to contribute 
    importantly to serious injury, or the threat thereof, if the growth 
    rate of imports from such country or countries during the period in 
    which an injurious increase in imports occurred is appreciably lower 
    than the growth rate of total imports from all sources over the same 
    period.
    (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section and section 312(a), 
the term ``contribute importantly'' refers to an important cause, but 
not necessarily the most important cause.

SEC. 312. PRESIDENTIAL ACTION REGARDING NAFTA IMPORTS.

    (a) In General.--In determining whether to take action under chapter 
1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to imports from a 
NAFTA country, the President shall determine whether--
        (1) imports from such country, considered individually, account 
    for a substantial share of total imports; or
        (2) imports from a NAFTA country, considered individually, or in 
    exceptional circumstances imports from NAFTA countries considered 
    collectively, contribute importantly to the serious injury, or 
    threat thereof, found by the International Trade Commission.
    (b) Exclusion of NAFTA Imports.--In determining the nature and 
extent of action to be taken under chapter 1 of title II of the Trade 
Act of 1974, the President shall exclude from such action imports from a 
NAFTA country if the President makes a negative determination under 
subsection (a) (1) or (2) with respect to imports from such country.
    (c) Action After Exclusion of NAFTA Country Imports.--
        (1) In general.--If the President, under subsection (b), 
    excludes imports from a NAFTA country or countries from action under 
    chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 but thereafter 
    determines that a surge in imports from that country or countries is 
    undermining the effectiveness of the action--
            (A) the President may take appropriate action under such 
        chapter 1 to include those imports in the action; and
            (B) any entity that is representative of an industry for 
        which such action is being taken may request the International 
        Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of the surge in 
        such imports.
        (2) Investigation.--Upon receiving a request under paragraph 
    (1)(B), the International Trade Commission shall conduct an 
    investigation to determine whether a surge in such imports 
    undermines the effectiveness of the action. The International Trade 
    Commission shall submit the findings of its investigation to the 
    President no later than 30 days after the request is received by the 
    International Trade Commission.
        (3) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
    ``surge'' means a significant increase in imports over the trend for 
    a recent representative base period.
    (d) Condition Applicable to Quantitative Restrictions.--Any action 
taken under this section proclaiming a quantitative restriction shall 
permit the importation of a quantity or value of the article which is 
not less than the quantity or value of such article imported into the 
United States during the most recent period that is representative of 
imports of such article, with allowance for reasonable growth.

the committee--
        (1) shall have access to, and the right to copy, any document, 
    paper, or record pertinent to the subject matter under 
    consideration, in the possession of any individual, partnership, 
    corporation, association, organization, or other entity;

affirmations, examine witnesses, take testimony, and receive evidence.
    (b) Witnesses and Evidence.--The attendance of witnesses who are 
authorized to be summoned, and the production of documentary evidence 
authorized to be ordered, under subsection (a) may be required from any

production of documentary evidence. Such court, within the jurisdiction 
of which such inquiry is carried on, may, in case of contumacy or 
refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any individual, partnership, 
corporation, association, organization, or other entity, issue an order 
requiring such individual or entity to appear before the committee, or 
to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence 
concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the 
court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.

jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus commanding compliance with the 
provisions of this section or any order of the committee made in

shall then be subscribed by the deponent. Any individual, partnership, 
corporation, association, organization, or other entity may be compelled 
to appear and be deposed and to produce documentary evidence in the same 
manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce 
documentary evidence before the committee, as provided in this section.

representative of a United States industry and has reason to believe--
        (1) that--
            (A) as a result of implementation of provisions of the 
        Agreement, the industry is likely to face increased competition 
        from subsidized imports, from a NAFTA country, with which it 
        directly competes; or
            (B) the industry is likely to face increased competition 
        from subsidized imports with which it directly competes from any 
        other country designated by the President, following 
        consultations with the Congress, as benefiting from a reduction 
        of tariffs or other trade barriers under a trade agreement that 
        enters into force with respect to the United States after 
        January 1, 1994; and
        (2) that the industry is likely to experience a deterioration of 
    its competitive position before more effective rules and disciplines 
    relating to the use of government subsidies have been developed with 
    respect to the country concerned;
may file with the Trade Representative a petition that such industry be 
identified under this section.
    (b) Identification of Industry.--Within 90 days after receipt of a 
petition under subsection (a), the Trade Representative, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Commerce, shall decide whether to identify the

industry may face both the subsidization described in subsection (a)(1) 
and the deterioration described in subsection (a)(2).
    (c) Action After Identification.--At the request of an entity that 
is representative of an industry identified under subsection (b), the

    any investigation under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 or any 
    other trade law, other than title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, the 
    Trade Representative, after consultation with the Secretary of

        established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974;

    initiated under section 302(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 as a result 
    of a review under this subsection and the Trade Representative, 
    following such investigation (including any applicable dispute 
    settlement proceedings under the Agreement or any other trade 
    agreement), determines to take action under section 301(a) of such 
    Act, the Trade Representative shall give preference to actions that 
    most directly affect the products that benefit from governmental 
    subsidies and were the subject of the investigation, unless there 
    are no significant imports of such products or the Trade 
    Representative otherwise determines that application of the action 
    to other products would be more effective.

    trade law.

   Subtitle B--Provisions Relating to Performance Under the Agreement

SEC. 511. DISCRIMINATORY TAXES.

    It is the sense of the Congress that when a State, province, or 
other governmental entity of a NAFTA country discriminatorily enforces 
sales or other taxes so as to afford protection to domestic production 
or domestic service providers, such enforcement is in violation of the 
terms of the Agreement. When such discriminatory enforcement adversely 
affects United States producers of goods or United States service 
providers, the Trade Representative should pursue all appropriate 
remedies to obtain removal of such discriminatory enforcement, including 
invocation of the provisions of the Agreement.
    SEC. 512. REVIEW OF THE OPERATION AND EFFECTS OF THE AGREEMENT.
    (a) Study.--By not later than July 1, 1997, the President shall

    States, including with respect to the United States gross national

    United States that have significantly increased exports to Mexico or 
    Canada as a result of the Agreement, or in which imports into the 
    United States from Mexico or Canada have increased significantly as 
    a result of the Agreement, and the extent of any change in the 
    wages, employment, or productivity in each such industry as a result 
    of the Agreement.
        (3) The extent to which investment in new or existing production 
    or other operations in the United States has been redirected to 
    Mexico as a result of the Agreement, and the effect on United States 
    employment of such redirection.
        (4) The extent of any increase in investment, including foreign 
    direct investment and increased investment by United States 
    investors, in new or existing production or other operations in the 
    United States as a result of the Agreement, and the effect on United 
    States employment of such investment.
        (5) The extent to which the Agreement has contributed to--
            (A) improvement in real wages and working conditions in 
        Mexico,
            (B) effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws in 
        Mexico, and
            (C) the reduction or abatement of pollution in the region of 
        the United States-Mexico border.
    (b) Scope.--In assessing the factors listed in subsection (a), to 
the extent possible, the study shall distinguish between the 
consequences of the Agreement and events that likely would have occurred 
without the Agreement. In addition, the study shall evaluate the effects 
of the Agreement relative to aggregate economic changes and, to the 
extent possible, relative to the effects of other factors, including--
        (1) international competition,
        (2) reductions in defense spending,
        (3) the shift from traditional manufacturing to knowledge and 
    information based economic activity, and
        (4) the Federal debt burden.
    (c) Recommendations of the President.--The study shall include any 
appropriate recommendations by the President with respect to the 
operation and effects of the Agreement, including recommendations with 
respect to the specific factors listed in subsection (a).
    (d) Recommendations of Certain Committees.--The President shall 
provide the study to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate and any other 
committee that has jurisdiction over any provision of United States law 
that was either enacted or amended by the North American Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act. Each such committee may hold hearings and 
make recommendations to the President with respect to the operation and 
effects of the Agreement.

    SEC. 514. REPORT ON IMPACT OF NAFTA ON MOTOR VEHICLE EXPORTS TO 
      MEXICO.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts is one of 
    the most restricted areas of trade between the United States and 
    Mexico.
        (2) The elimination of Mexico's restrictive barriers to trade in 
    motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts over a 10-year period under 
    the Agreement should increase substantially United States exports of 
    such products to Mexico.
        (3) The Department of Commerce estimates that the Agreement 
    provides the opportunity to increase United States exports of motor 
    vehicles and motor vehicle parts by $1,000,000,000 during the first 
    year of the Agreement's implementation with the potential for 
    additional increases over the 10-year transition period.
        (4) The United States automotive industry has estimated that 
    United States exports of motor vehicles to Mexico should increase to 
    more than 60,000 units during the first year of the Agreement's 
    implementation, which is substantially above the current level of 
    4,000 units.
    (b) Trade Representative Report.--No later than July 1, 1995, and 
annually thereafter through 1999, the Trade Representative shall submit 
a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on 
Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on how effective the 
provisions of the Agreement are with respect to increasing United States 
exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to Mexico. Each report 
shall identify and determine the following:
        (1) The patterns of trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
    parts between the United States and Mexico during the preceding 12-
    month period.
        (2) The level of tariff and nontariff barriers that were in 
    force during the preceding 12-month period.
        (3) The amount by which United States exports of motor vehicles 
    and motor vehicle parts to Mexico have increased from the preceding 
    12-month period as a result of the elimination of Mexican tariff and 
    nontariff barriers under the Agreement.
        (4) Whether any such increase in United States exports meets the 
    levels of new export opportunities anticipated under the Agreement.
        (5) If the anticipated levels of new United States export 
    opportunities are not reached, what actions the Trade Representative 
    is prepared to take to realize the benefits anticipated under the 
    Agreement, including possible initiation of additional negotiations 
    with Mexico for the purpose of seeking modifications of the 
    Agreement.

    ``(a) Entry Examination.--

    or regulation to be inspected, examined, or appraised shall not be 
    delivered from customs custody (except under such bond or other 
    security as may be prescribed by the Secretary to assure compliance 
    with all applicable laws, regulations, and instructions which the 
    Secretary or the Customs Service is authorized to enforce) until the 
    merchandise has been inspected, appraised, or examined and is 
    reported by the Customs Service to have been truly and correctly 
    invoiced and found to comply with the requirements of the laws of 
    the United States.
        ``(2) Examination.--The Customs Service--
            ``(A) shall designate the packages or quantities of 
        merchandise covered by any invoice or entry which are to be 
        opened and examined for the purpose of appraisement or 
        otherwise;
            ``(B) shall order such packages or quantities to be sent to 
        such place as is designated by the Secretary by regulation for 
        such purpose;
            ``(C) may require such additional packages or quantities as 
        the Secretary considers necessary for such purpose; and
            ``(D) shall inspect a sufficient number of shipments, and 
        shall examine a sufficient number of entries, to ensure 
        compliance with the laws enforced by the Customs Service.
        ``(3) Unspecified articles.--If any package contains any article 
    not specified in the invoice or entry and, in the opinion of the 
    Customs Service, the article was omitted from the invoice or entry--
            ``(A) with fraudulent intent on the part of the seller, 
        shipper, owner, agent, importer of record, or entry filer, the 
        contents of the entire package in which such article is found 
        shall be subject to seizure; or
            ``(B) without fraudulent intent, the value of the article 
        shall be added to the entry and the duties, fees, and taxes 
        thereon paid accordingly.
        ``(4) Deficiency.--If a deficiency is found in quantity, weight, 
    or measure in the examination of any package, the person finding the 
    deficiency shall make a report thereof to the Customs Service. The 
    Customs Service shall make allowance for the deficiency in the 
    liquidation of duties.
        ``(5) Information required for release.--If an examination is 
    conducted, any information required for release shall be provided, 
    either electronically or in paper form, to the Customs Service at

    limit the authority of the Customs Service to conduct an 
    examination.
    ``(b) Testing Laboratories.--
        ``(1) Accreditation of private testing laboratories.--The 
    Customs Service shall establish and implement a procedure, under 
    regulations promulgated by the Secretary, for accrediting private 
    laboratories within the United States which may be used to perform 
    tests (that would otherwise be performed by Customs Service 
    laboratories) to establish the characteristics, quantities, or 
    composition of imported merchandise. Such regulations--
            ``(A) shall establish the conditions required for the 
        laboratories to receive and maintain accreditation for purposes 
        of this subsection;
            ``(B) shall establish the conditions regarding the 
        suspension and revocation of accreditation, which may include 
        the imposition of a monetary penalty not to exceed $100,000 and 
        such penalty is in addition to the recovery, from a gauger or 
        laboratory accredited under paragraph (1), of any loss of 
        revenue that may have occurred, but the Customs Service--
                ``(i) may seek to recover lost revenue only in cases 
            where the gauger or laboratory intentionally falsified the 
            analysis or gauging report in collusion with the importer; 
            and
                ``(ii) shall neither assess penalties nor seek to 
            recover lost revenue because of a good faith difference of 
            professional opinion; and
            ``(C) may provide for the imposition of a reasonable charge 
        for accreditation and periodic reaccreditation.
    The collection of any charge for accreditation and reaccreditation 
    under this section is not prohibited by section 13031(e)(6) of the 
    Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 
    58c(e)(6)).
        ``(2) Appeal of adverse accreditation decisions.--A laboratory 
    applying for accreditation, or that is accredited, under this 
    section may contest any decision or order of the Customs Service 
    denying, suspending, or revoking accreditation, or imposing a 
    monetary penalty, by commencing an action in accordance with chapter 
    169 of title 28, United States Code, in the Court of International 
    Trade within 60 days after issuance of the decision or order.
        ``(3) Testing by accredited laboratories.--When requested by an 
    importer of record of merchandise, the Customs Service shall 
    authorize the release to the importer of a representative sample of 
    the merchandise for testing, at the expense of the importer, by a 
    laboratory accredited under paragraph (1). The testing results from 
    a laboratory accredited under paragraph (1) that are submitted by an 
    importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry shall, in 
    the absence of testing results obtained from a Customs Service 
    laboratory, be accepted by the Customs Service if the importer of 
    record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the 
    merchandise in the entry. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
    construed to limit in any way or preclude the authority of the 
    Customs Service to test or analyze any sample or merchandise 
    independently.
        ``(4) Availability of testing procedure, methodologies, and 
    information.--Testing procedures and methodologies used by the 
    Customs Service, and information resulting from any testing 
    conducted by the Customs Service, shall be made available as 
    follows:
            ``(A) Testing procedures and methodologies shall be made 
        available upon request to any person unless the procedures or 
        methodologies are--
                ``(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent 
            related to such procedures or methodologies, or
                ``(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement 
            purposes.
            ``(B) Information resulting from testing shall be made 
        available upon request to the importer of record and any agent 
        thereof unless the information reveals information which is--
                ``(i) proprietary to the holder of a copyright or 
            patent; or
                ``(ii) developed by the Customs Service for enforcement 
            purposes.
        ``(5) Miscellaneous provisions.--For purposes of this 
    subsection--
            ``(A) any reference to a private laboratory includes a 
        reference to a private gauger; and
            ``(B) accreditation of private laboratories extends only to 
        the performance of functions by such laboratories that are 
        within the scope of those responsibilities for determinations of 
        the elements relating to admissibility, quantity, composition, 
        or characteristics of imported merchandise that are vested in, 
        or delegated to, the Customs Service.
    ``(c) Detentions.--Except in the case of merchandise with respect to 
which the determination of admissibility is vested in an agency other 
than the Customs Service, the following apply:
        ``(1) In general.--Within the 5-day period (excluding weekends 
    and holidays) following the date on which merchandise is presented 
    for customs examination, the Customs Service shall decide whether to 
    release or detain the merchandise. Merchandise which is not released 
    within such 5-day period shall be considered to be detained 
    merchandise.
        ``(2) Notice of detention.--The Customs Service shall issue a 
    notice to the importer or other party having an interest in detained 
    merchandise no later than 5 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 
    after the decision to detain the merchandise is made. The notice 
    shall advise the importer or other interested party of--
            ``(A) the initiation of the detention;
            ``(B) the specific reason for the detention;
            ``(C) the anticipated length of the detention;
            ``(D) the nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; 
        and
            ``(E) the nature of any information which, if supplied to 
        the Customs Service, may accelerate the disposition of the 
        detention.
        ``(3) Testing results.--Upon request by the importer or other 
    party having an interest in detained merchandise, the Customs 
    Service shall provide the party with copies of the results of any 
    testing conducted by the Customs Service on the merchandise and a 
    description of the testing procedures and methodologies (unless such 
    procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a 
    copyright or patent or were developed by the Customs Service for 
    enforcement purposes). The results and test description shall be in 
    sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the 
    testing and the results.
        ``(4) Seizure and forfeiture.--If otherwise provided by law, 
    detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited.
        ``(5) Effect of failure to make determination.--
            ``(A) The failure by the Customs Service to make a final 
        determination with respect to the admissibility of detained 
        merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been 
        presented for customs examination, or such longer period if 
        specifically authorized by law, shall be treated as a decision 
        of the Customs Service to exclude the merchandise for purposes 
        of section 514(a)(4).
            ``(B) For purposes of section 1581 of title 28, United 
        States Code, a protest against the decision to exclude the 
        merchandise which has not been allowed or denied in whole or in 
        part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was 
        filed shall be treated as having been denied on such 30th day.
            ``(C) Notwithstanding section 2639 of title 28, United 
        States Code, once an action respecting a detention is commenced, 
        unless the Customs Service establishes by a preponderance of the 
        evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for 
        good cause, the court shall grant the appropriate relief which 
        may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the 
        detention and release the merchandise.''.
    (b) Existing Laboratories.--Accreditation under section 499(b) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 (as added by subsection (a)) is not required for 
any private laboratory (including any gauger) that was accredited or 
approved by the Customs Service as of the day before the date of the

    warehouse or general purpose foreign trade zone), the Customs 
    Service auditor shall provide the person being audited, in advance 
    of the audit, with a reasonable estimate of the time to be required 
    for the audit. If in the course of an audit it becomes apparent that 
    additional time will be required, the Customs Service auditor shall 
    immediately provide a further estimate of such additional time.
        ``(2) Before commencing an audit, the Customs Service auditor 
    shall inform the party to be audited of his right to an entry 
    conference at which time the purpose will be explained and an 
    estimated termination date set. Upon completion of on-site audit 
    activities, the Customs Service auditor shall schedule a closing 
    conference to explain the preliminary results of the audit.
        ``(3) Except as provided in paragraph (5), if the estimated or 
    actual termination date for an audit passes without the Customs 
    Service auditor providing a closing conference to explain the 
    results of the audit, the person being audited may petition in 
    writing for such a conference to the appropriate regional 
    commissioner, who, upon receipt of such a request, shall provide for

    date. After application of any exemption contained in section 552 of 
    title 5, United States Code, a copy of the formal written audit 
    report shall be sent to the person audited no later than 30 days

    community, the Customs Service shall by regulation establish a 
    recordkeeping compliance program which the parties listed in section 
    508(a) may participate in after being certified by the Customs 
    Service under paragraph (2). Participation in the recordkeeping

    participant in the recordkeeping compliance program after meeting 
    the general recordkeeping requirements established under the program 
    or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of 
    the recordkeeper and the Customs Service. Certification requirements 
    shall take into account the size and nature of the importing 
    business and the volume of imports. In order to be certified, the 
    recordkeeper must be able to demonstrate that it--

        notified by the Customs Service of violations or problems 
        regarding such program.
    ``(g) Penalties.--
        ``(1) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term

    demand for information under subsection (a)(1)(A) the following

        failure of the person to maintain, store, or retrieve the 
        demanded information, such person shall be subject to a penalty, 
        for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $100,000, or an 
        amount equal to 75 percent of the appraised value of the 
        merchandise, whichever amount is less.
            ``(B) If the failure to comply is a result of the negligence 
        of the person in maintaining, storing, or retrieving the 
        demanded information, such person shall be subject to a penalty, 
        for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $10,000, or an 
        amount equal to 40 percent of the appraised value of the 
        merchandise, whichever amount is less.
            ``(C) In addition to any penalty imposed under subparagraph 
        (A) or (B) regarding demanded information, if such information 
        related to the eligibility of merchandise for a column 1 special 
        rate of duty under title I, the entry of such merchandise--
                ``(i) if unliquidated, shall be liquidated at the 
            applicable column 1 general rate of duty; or
                ``(ii) if liquidated within the 2-year period preceding 
            the date of the demand, shall be reliquidated, 
            notwithstanding the time limitation in section 514 or 520,

        Customs Service demonstrates that the merchandise should be 
        dutiable at such rate.

                ``(i) has been certified as a participant in the 
            recordkeeping compliance program under subsection (f); and
                ``(ii) is generally in compliance with the appropriate 
            procedures and requirements of the program;
        does not produce a demanded record or information for a specific 
        release or provide the information by acceptable alternative 
        means, the Customs Service, in the absence of willfulness or 
        repeated violations, shall issue a written notice of the 
        violation to the recordkeeper in lieu of a monetary penalty. 
        Repeated violations by the recordkeeper may result in the 
        issuance of penalties and removal of certification under the 
        program until corrective action, satisfactory to the Customs 
        Service, is taken.
            ``(B) Contents of notice.--A notice of violation issued 
        under subparagraph (A) shall--

            produce demanded records or information may result in the 
            imposition of monetary penalties.
            ``(C) Response to notice.--Within a reasonable time after 
        receiving written notice under subparagraph (A), the 
        recordkeeper shall notify the Customs Service of the steps it 
        has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.
            ``(D) Regulations.--The Secretary shall promulgate 
        regulations to implement this paragraph. Such regulations may 
        specify the time periods for compliance with a demand for 
        information and provide guidelines which define repeated 
        violations for purposes of this paragraph. Any penalty issued 
        for a recordkeeping violation shall take into account the degree 
        of compliance compared to the total number of importations, the 
        nature of the demanded records and the recordkeeper's 
        cooperation.''.

SEC. 616. JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.

    The second sentence of section 510(a) (19 U.S.C. 1510(a)) is amended

    Section 515 (19 U.S.C. 1515) is amended by inserting at the end the 
following new subsections:

review was erroneously or improperly denied or was denied without 
authority for such action, it may file with the Commissioner of Customs 
a written request that the denial of the application for further review 
be set aside. Such request must be filed within 60 days after the date 
of the notice of the denial. The Commissioner of Customs may review such 
request and, based solely on the information before the Customs Service 
at the time the application for further review was denied, may set aside 
the denial of the application for further review and void the denial of 
protest, if appropriate. If the Commissioner of Customs fails to act 
within 60 days after the date of the request, the request shall be 
considered denied. All denials of protests are effective from the date 
of original denial for purposes of section 2636 of title 28, United 
States Code. If an action is commenced in the Court of International 
Trade that arises out of a protest or an application for further review, 
all administrative action pertaining to such protest or application 
shall terminate and any administrative action taken subsequent to the 
commencement of the action is null and void.
    ``(d) If a protest is timely and properly filed, but is denied 
contrary to proper instructions, the Customs Service may on its own 
initiative, or pursuant to a written request by the protesting party 
filed with the appropriate district director within 90 days after the 
date of the protest denial, void the denial of the protest.''.

SEC. 622. PENALTIES FOR FALSE DRAWBACK CLAIMS.

    (a) Amendment.--Part V of title IV is amended by inserting after 
section 593 the following new section:

``SEC. 593A. PENALTIES FOR FALSE DRAWBACK CLAIMS.

    ``(a) Prohibition.--
        ``(1) General rule.--No person, by fraud, or negligence--
            ``(A) may seek, induce or affect, or attempt to seek, 
        induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or 
        others of any drawback claim by means of--
                ``(i) any document, written or oral statement, or 
            electronically transmitted data or information, or act which 
            is material and false, or
                ``(ii) any omission which is material; or
            ``(B) may aid or abet any other person to violate 
        subparagraph (A).
        ``(2) Exception.--Clerical errors or mistakes of fact are not 
    violations of paragraph (1) unless they are part of a pattern of 
    negligent conduct. The mere nonintentional repetition by an 
    electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a 
    pattern of negligent conduct.
    ``(b) Procedures.--
        ``(1) Prepenalty notice.--
            ``(A) In general.--If the Customs Service has reasonable 
        cause to believe that there has been a violation of subsection 
        (a) and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the 
        Customs Service shall issue to the person concerned a written 
        notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty. Such 
        notice shall--
                ``(i) identify the drawback claim;
                ``(ii) set forth the details relating to the seeking, 
            inducing, or affecting, or the attempted seeking, inducing, 
            or affecting, or the aiding or procuring of, the drawback 
            claim;
                ``(iii) specify all laws and regulations allegedly 
            violated;
                ``(iv) disclose all the material facts which establish 
            the alleged violation;
                ``(v) state whether the alleged violation occurred as a 
            result of fraud or negligence;
                ``(vi) state the estimated actual or potential loss of 
            revenue due to the drawback claim, and, taking into account 
            all circumstances, the amount of the proposed monetary 
            penalty; and
                ``(vii) inform such person that he shall have a 
            reasonable opportunity to make representations, both oral 
            and written, as to why a claim for a monetary penalty should 
            not be issued in the amount stated.
            ``(B) Exceptions.--The Customs Service may not issue a 
        prepenalty notice if the amount of the penalty in the penalty 
        claim issued under paragraph (2) is $1,000 or less. In such 
        cases, the Customs Service may proceed directly with a penalty 
        claim.
            ``(C) Prior approval.--No prepenalty notice in which the 
        alleged violation occurred as a result of fraud shall be issued 
        without the prior approval of Customs Headquarters.
        ``(2) Penalty claim.--After considering representations, if any, 
    made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under 
    paragraph (1), the Customs Service shall determine whether any 
    violation of subsection (a), as alleged in the notice, has occurred. 
    If the Customs Service determines that there was no violation, the 
    Customs Service shall promptly issue a written statement of the 
    determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the 
    Customs Service determines that there was a violation, Customs shall 
    issue a written penalty claim to such person. The written penalty 
    claim shall specify all changes in the information provided under 
    clauses (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1)(A). Such person shall 
    have a reasonable opportunity under section 618 to make 
    representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or 
    mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any 
    proceeding under section 618, the Customs Service shall provide to 
    the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final 
    determination, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on 
    which such determination is based.
    ``(c) Maximum Penalties.--
        ``(1) Fraud.--A fraudulent violation of subsection (a) of this 
    section is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 
    3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.
        ``(2) Negligence.--
            ``(A) In general.--A negligent violation of subsection (a) 
        is punishable by a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed 20 
        percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the 1st 
        violation.
            ``(B) Repetitive violations.--If the Customs Service 
        determines that a repeat negligent violation occurs relating to 
        the same issue, the penalty amount for the 2d violation shall be 
        in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the total actual or 
        potential loss of revenue. The penalty amount for each 
        succeeding repetitive negligent violation shall be in an amount 
        not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue. If the 
        same party commits a nonrepetitive violation, that violation 
        shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed 20 percent of the 
        actual or potential loss of revenue.
        ``(3) Prior disclosure.--
            ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), if the 
        person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of 
        subsection (a) before, or without knowledge of the commencement 
        of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary 
        penalty assessed under this subsection may not exceed--
                ``(i) if the violation resulted from fraud, an amount 
            equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United 
            States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of 
            the claim; or
                ``(ii) if the violation resulted from negligence, an 
            amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the 
            prevailing rate of interest applied under section 6621 of 
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on the amount of actual 
            revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived 
            during the period that--

                    ``(I) begins on the date of the overpayment of the 
                claim; and
                    ``(II) ends on the date on which the person 
                concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.

            ``(B) Condition affecting penalty limitations.--The 
        limitations in subparagraph (A) on the amount of the monetary 
        penalty to be assessed under subsection (c) apply only if the 
        person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on 
        the claim at the time of disclosure, or within 30 days (or such 
        longer period as the Customs Service may provide), after notice 
        by the Customs Service of its calculation of the amount of the 
        overpayment.
            ``(C) Burden of proof.--The person asserting lack of 
        knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the 
        burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.
        ``(4) Commencement of investigation.--For purposes of this 
    section, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be 
    commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed 
    information on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service 
    as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or 
    information was received which caused the Customs Service to believe 
    that a possibility of a violation of subsection (a) existed.
        ``(5) Exclusivity.--Penalty claims under this section shall be 
    the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback related violation of 
    subsection (a).
    ``(d) Deprivation of Lawful Revenue.--Notwithstanding section 514, 
if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes 
resulting from a violation of subsection (a), the Customs Service shall 
require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary 
penalty is assessed.
    ``(e) Drawback Compliance Program.--
        ``(1) In general.--After consultation with the drawback trade 
    community, the Customs Service shall establish a drawback compliance 
    program in which claimants and other parties in interest may 
    participate after being certified by the Customs Service under 
    paragraph (2). Participation in the drawback compliance program is 
    voluntary.
        ``(2) Certification.--A party may be certified as a participant 
    in the drawback compliance program after meeting the general 
    requirements established under the program or after negotiating an 
    alternative program suited to the needs of the party and the Customs 
    Service. Certification requirements shall take into account the size 
    and nature of the party's drawback program and the volume of claims. 
    In order to be certified, the participant must be able to 
    demonstrate that it--
            ``(A) understands the legal requirements for filing claims, 
        including the nature of the records required to be maintained 
        and produced and the time periods involved;
            ``(B) has in place procedures to explain the Customs Service 
        requirements to those employees that are involved in the 
        preparation of claims, and the maintenance and production of 
        required records;
            ``(C) has in place procedures regarding the preparation of 
        claims and maintenance of required records, and the production 
        of such records to the Customs Service;
            ``(D) has designated a dependable individual or individuals 
        to be responsible for compliance under the program and whose 
        duties include maintaining familiarity with the drawback 
        requirements of the Customs Service;
            ``(E) has a record maintenance procedure approved by the 
        Customs Service for original records, or, if approved by the 
        Customs Service, for alternate records or recordkeeping formats 
        other than the original records; and
            ``(F) has procedures for notifying the Customs Service of 
        variances to, and violations of, the requirements of the 
        drawback compliance program or any negotiated alternative 
        programs, and for taking corrective action when notified by the 
        Customs Service for violations or problems regarding such 
        program.
    ``(f) Alternatives to Penalties.--
        ``(1) In general.--When a party that--
            ``(A) has been certified as a participant in the drawback 
        compliance program under subsection (e); and
            ``(B) is generally in compliance with the appropriate 
        procedures and requirements of the program;
    commits a violation of subsection (a), the Customs Service, shall, 
    in the absence of fraud or repeated violations, and in lieu of a 
    monetary penalty, issue a written notice of the violation to the 
    party. Repeated violations by a party may result in the issuance of 
    penalties and removal of certification under the program until 
    corrective action, satisfactory to the Customs Service, is taken.
        ``(2) Contents of notice.--A notice of violation issued under 
    paragraph (1) shall--
            ``(A) state that the party has violated subsection (a);

    receiving written notice under paragraph (1), the party shall notify 
    the Customs Service of the steps it has taken to prevent a 
    recurrence of the violation.

        ``(1) A party who has been issued a written notice under 
    subsection (f)(1) and subsequently commits a repeat negligent 
    violation involving the same issue is subject to the following

    violation which was not repetitive, the party shall be issued a 
    `warning letter', and, for any subsequent violation, shall be 
    subject to the same maximum penalty amounts stated in paragraph (1).
    ``(h) Regulation.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations and

involving the same issue shall be treated as a repetitive violation for 
a maximum period of 3 years.

other provision of law, in any proceeding commenced by the United States

    not occur as a result of negligence.''.

            enable the Customs Service to determine whether the 
            merchandise may be released from customs custody, and

    he is the owner or purchaser of merchandise the Customs Service may, 
    without liability, accept the declaration. For the purposes of this 
    Act, the importer of record must be one of the parties who is 
    eligible to file the documentation or information required by this 
    section.

    importation and exportation of merchandise, the facilitation of the 
    commerce of the United States, and the equal treatment of all 
    importers of record of imported merchandise.
    ``(b) Reconciliation.--
        ``(1) In general.--A party that electronically transmits an 
    entry summary or import activity summary statement may at the time 
    of filing such summary or statement notify the Customs Service of 
    his intention to file a reconciliation pursuant to such regulations 
    as the Secretary may prescribe. Such reconciliation must be filed by 
    the importer of record within such time period as is prescribed by 
    regulation but no later than 15 months following the filing of the 
    entry summary or import activity summary statement; except that the 
    prescribed time period for reconciliation issues relating to the 
    assessment of antidumping and countervailing duties shall require 
    filing no later than 90 days after the Customs Service advises the 
    importer that a period of review for antidumping or countervailing 
    duty purposes has been completed. Before filing a reconciliation, an 
    importer of record shall post bond or other security pursuant to 
    such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.
        ``(2) Regulations regarding ad/cv duties.--The Secretary shall 
    prescribe, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, such 
    regulations as are necessary to adapt the reconciliation process for 
    use in the collection of antidumping and countervailing duties.
    ``(c) Release of Merchandise.--The Customs Service may permit the 
entry and release of merchandise from customs custody in accordance with 
such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. No officer of the 
Customs Service shall be liable to any person with respect to the 
delivery of merchandise released from customs custody in accordance with 
such regulations.
    ``(d) Signing and Contents.--Entries shall be signed by the importer 
of record, or his agent, unless filed pursuant to an electronic data 
interchange system. If electronically filed, each transmission of data 
shall be certified by an importer of record or his agent, one of whom 
shall be resident in the United States for purposes of receiving service 
of process, as being true and correct to the best of his knowledge and 
belief, and such transmission shall be binding in the same manner and to 
the same extent as a signed document. The entry shall set forth such 
facts in regard to the importation as the Secretary may require and 
shall be accompanied by such invoices, bills of lading, certificates, 
and documents, or their electronically submitted equivalents, as are 
required by regulation.
    ``(e) Production of Invoice.--The Secretary may provide by 
regulation for the production of an invoice, parts thereof, or the 
electronic equivalents thereof, in such manner and form, and under such 
terms and conditions, as the Secretary considers necessary.
    ``(f) Statistical Enumeration.--The Secretary, the Secretary of 
Commerce, and the United States International Trade Commission shall 
establish from time to time for statistical purposes an enumeration of 
articles in such detail as in their judgment may be necessary, 
comprehending all merchandise imported into the United States and 
exported from the United States, and shall seek, in conjunction with 
statistical programs for domestic production and programs for achieving 
international harmonization of trade statistics, to establish the 
comparability thereof with such enumeration of articles. All import 
entries and export declarations shall include or have attached thereto 
an accurate statement specifying, in terms of such detailed enumeration, 
the kinds and quantities of all merchandise imported and exported and 
the value of the total quantity of each kind of article.
    ``(g) Statement of Cost of Production.--Under such regulations as 
the Secretary may prescribe, the Customs Service may require a verified 
statement from the manufacturer or producer showing the cost of 
producing the imported merchandise, if the Customs Service considers 
such verification necessary for the appraisement of such merchandise.
    ``(h) Admissibility of Data Electronically Transmitted.--Any entry 
or other information transmitted by means of an authorized electronic 
data interchange system shall be admissible in any and all 
administrative and judicial proceedings as evidence of such entry or 
information.''.
    (b) Amendment to Section 771.--Section 771 (19 U.S.C. 1677) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
        ``(23) Entry.--The term `entry' includes, in appropriate 
    circumstances as determined by the administering authority, a 
    reconciliation entry created under a reconciliation process, defined 
    in section 401(s), that is initiated by an importer. The liability 
    of an importer under an antidumping or countervailing duty 
    proceeding for entries of merchandise subject to the proceeding will 
    attach to the corresponding reconciliation entry or entries. 
    Suspension of liquidation of the reconciliation entry or entries, 
    for the purpose of enforcing this title, is equivalent to the 
    suspension of liquidation of the corresponding individual entries; 
    but the suspension of liquidation of the reconciliation entry or 
    entries for such purpose does not preclude liquidation for any other 
    purpose.''.
