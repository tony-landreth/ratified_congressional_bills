                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
    To designate September 13, 1993, as ``Commodore John Barry Day''.

Whereas the United States of America is a nation of immigrants and the 
  contributions of Irish immigrants and their descendants to the defense 
  of the public liberty has been a hallmark of Irish Americans;
Whereas during the War for Independence Captain John Barry, a native of 
  County Wexford, Ireland, achieved the first victory for the 
  Continental Navy while in command of the ship ``Lexington'' by 
  capturing the British ship ``Edward'', organizing General George 
  Washington's crossing of the Delaware River which led to the victory 
  at Trenton in 1776, transported gold from France to America while in 
  command of the ship ``Alliance'', and achieved the last victory of the 
  war for the Continental Navy while in command of ``Alliance'' by 
  defeating the British ship HMS ``Sybille'';
Whereas during the War for Independence Captain John Barry rejected 
  British General Lord Howe's offer to desert the Continental Navy and 
  join the British Navy, stating: ``Not the value and command of the 
  whole British fleet can lure me from the cause of my country.'';
Whereas after the War for Independence the United States Congress 
  recognized John Barry as the premier American naval hero of that war;
Whereas in 1787 Captain John Barry organized the compulsory attendance 
  of members of the Pennsylvania Assembly in Philadelphia, thus ensuring 
  the quorum necessary to call a Convention and recommend the 
  ratification of the Constitution;
Whereas on June 14, 1794, pursuant to ``Commission No. 1'', President 
  Washington commissioned John Barry as commodore in the new United 
  States Navy;
Whereas Commodore John Barry helped to build and lead the new United 
  States Navy which included his command of the U.S.S. ``United States'' 
  and the U.S.S. ``Constitution'' (``Old Ironsides'');
Whereas Commodore John Barry is recognized along with General Stephen 
  Moylan in the Statue of Liberty Museum as one of six foreign-born 
  great leaders of the War for Independence;
Whereas in 1991 and 1992 President George Bush proclaimed September 13 
  as ``Commodore John Barry Day''; and
Whereas designating a day to commemorate Commodore John Barry would be 
  important to United States Navy veterans, Irish Americans, and to all 
  the people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That September 13, 1993, is 
designated as ``Commodore John Barry Day'', and the President of the 
United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe such day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
