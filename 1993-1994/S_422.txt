    investors from unregulated dealers and maintain the efficiency of 
    the government securities market; and

SEC. 103. TRANSACTION RECORDS.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 15C(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following 
new paragraph:
    ``(3) Government Securities Trade Reconstruction.--
        ``(A) Furnishing records.--Every government securities broker 
    and government securities dealer shall furnish to the Commission on 
    request such records of government securities transactions, 
    including records of the date and time of execution of trades, as 
    the Commission may require to reconstruct trading in the course of a 
    particular inquiry or investigation being conducted by the 
    Commission for enforcement or surveillance purposes. In requiring 
    information pursuant to this paragraph, the Commission shall specify 
    the information required, the period for which it is required, the 
    time and date on which the information must be furnished, and 
    whether the information is to be furnished directly to the 
    Commission, to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or to an 
    appropriate regulatory agency or self-regulatory organization with 
    responsibility for examining the government securities broker or 
    government securities dealer. The Commission may require that such 
    information be furnished in machine readable form notwithstanding 
    any limitation in subparagraph (B). In utilizing its authority to 
    require information in machine readable form, the Commission shall 
    minimize the burden such requirement may place on small government 
    securities brokers and dealers.
        ``(B) Limitation; construction.--The Commission shall not 
    utilize its authority under this paragraph to develop regular 
    reporting requirements, except that the Commission may require 
    information to be furnished under this paragraph as frequently as 
    necessary for particular inquiries or investigations for enforcement 
    or surveillance purposes. This paragraph shall not be construed as 
    requiring, or as authorizing the Commission to require, any 
    government securities broker or government securities dealer to 
    obtain or maintain any information for purposes of this paragraph 
    which is not otherwise maintained by such broker or dealer in 
    accordance with any other provision of law or usual and customary 
    business practice. The Commission shall, where feasible, avoid 
    requiring any information to be furnished under this paragraph that 
    the Commission may obtain from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
        ``(C) Procedures for requiring information.--At the time the 
    Commission requests any information pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
    with respect to any government securities broker or government 
    securities dealer for which the Commission is not the appropriate 
    regulatory agency, the Commission shall notify the appropriate 
    regulatory agency for such government securities broker or 
    government securities dealer and, upon request, furnish to the 
    appropriate regulatory agency any information supplied to the 
    Commission.
        ``(D) Consultation.--Within 90 days after the date of enactment 
    of this paragraph, and annually thereafter, or upon the request of 
    any other appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission shall 
    consult with the other appropriate regulatory agencies to determine 
    the availability of records that may be required to be furnished 
    under this paragraph and, for those records available directly from 
    the other appropriate regulatory agencies, to develop a procedure 
    for furnishing such records expeditiously upon the Commission's 
    request.
        ``(E) Exclusion for examination reports.--Nothing in this 
    paragraph shall be construed so as to permit the Commission to 
    require any government securities broker or government securities 
    dealer to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report of any 
    appropriate regulatory agency other than the Commission or any 
    supervisory recommendations or analysis contained in any such 
    examination report.
        ``(F) Authority to limit disclosure of information.--
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission and the 
    appropriate regulatory agencies shall not be compelled to disclose 
    any information required or obtained under this paragraph. Nothing 
    in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission or any appropriate 
    regulatory agency to withhold information from Congress, or prevent 
    the Commission or any appropriate regulatory agency from complying 
    with a request for information from any other Federal department or 
    agency requesting information for purposes within the scope of its 
    jurisdiction, or from complying with an order of a court of the 
    United States in an action brought by the United States, the 
    Commission, or the appropriate regulatory agency. For purposes of 
    section 552 of title 5, United States Code, this subparagraph shall 
    be considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such 
    section 552.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--(1) Section 15C(a)(4) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(4)) is amended by inserting ``, 
other than subsection (d)(3),'' after ``subsection (a), (b), or (d) of 
this section''.
    (2) Section 15C(f)(2) of such Act is amended--
        (A) in the first sentence, by inserting ``, other than 
    subsection (d)(3)'', after ``threatened violation of the provisions 
    of this section''; and

    determines to be necessary and appropriate for the purpose of 
    monitoring the impact in the Treasury securities market of 
    concentrations of positions in Treasury securities and for the 
    purpose of otherwise assisting the Commission in the enforcement of 
    this title, taking into account any impact of such rules on the 
    efficiency and liquidity of the Treasury securities market and the 
    cost to taxpayers of funding the Federal debt. Unless otherwise 
    specified by the Secretary, reports required under this subsection 
    shall be filed with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting as 
    agent for the Secretary. Such reports shall, on a timely basis, be 
    provided directly to the Commission by the person with whom they are 
    filed.
        ``(2) Recordkeeping requirements.--Rules under this subsection 
    may require persons holding, maintaining, or controlling large 
    positions in Treasury securities to make and keep for prescribed 
    periods such records as the Secretary determines are necessary or 
    appropriate to ensure that such persons can comply with reporting 
    requirements under this subsection.

        control; and

        define terms used in this subsection that are not otherwise 
        defined in section 3 of this title.
            ``(B) Rules under this subsection shall specify--
                ``(i) the minimum size of positions subject to reporting 
            under this subsection, which shall be no less than the size 
            that provides the potential for manipulation or control of 
            the supply or price, or the cost of financing arrangements, 
            of an issue or the portion thereof that is available for 
            trading;

    protection of investors, the Secretary by rule or order may exempt 
    in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally, any person or 
    class or persons, or any transaction or class of transactions, from 
    the requirements of this subsection.

    any other provision of law, the Secretary and the Commission shall 
    not be compelled to disclose any information required to be kept or 
    reported under this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall 
    authorize the Secretary or the Commission to withhold information 
    from Congress, or prevent the Secretary or the Commission from 
    complying with a request for information from any other Federal 
    department or agency requesting information for purposes within the 
    scope of its jurisdiction, or from complying with an order of a 
    court of the United States in an action brought by the United 
    States, the Secretary, or the Commission. For purposes of section 
    552 of title 5, United States Code, this paragraph shall be 
    considered a statute described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of such
