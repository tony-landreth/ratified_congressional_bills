Whereas in recognition of the accomplishments of Christopher Columbus,

Whereas the phrase in the Declaration of Independence ``All men are created 
        equal'', was suggested by the Italian patriot and immigrant Philip

Whereas the people of the United States take great pride in the accomplishments 
        of the many outstanding men and women of Italian descent who have 
        enriched our Nation's history such as Fiorello La Guardia, the beloved 
        Mayor of New York City, and Enrico Fermi, who won the 1938 Nobel Prize 
        in Physics;
Whereas Italy enjoys a rich cultural heritage and has given the world the great 
        works of Dante, the breathtaking art of Giotti and Michelangelo, and the 
        inspirational music of Antonio Vivaldi and Domenico Scarlatti;
Whereas the Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci;
Whereas Giuseppe Verdi, one of the world's most renowned opera composers, was 
        born October 10, 1813;
Whereas William Paca, an Italian-American, was one of the signers of the

Whereas during October 1993 and October 1994 special attention will be directed 
        at National, State, and local programs that promote Italian heritage and 
        culture: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,
