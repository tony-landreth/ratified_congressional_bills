  206th Coast Artillery, served diligently and bravely on Hog Island, 
  Unalaska;
Whereas the 206th Coast Artillery Regiment of Arkansas was guarding 
  Dutch Harbor during the time of the Japanese attack;
Whereas, during the Japanese invasion of Dutch Harbor, three young 
  soldiers of the 206th Coast Artillery Unit were killed;
Whereas the city of Unalaska, Alaska has passed Res. 92-28, designating 
  the beach at 53 degrees 53,51"N, 166 degrees 34,15"W to 53 degrees 
  53,48"N, 166 degrees 34,21"W on Hog Island, Unalaska as ``Arkansas 
  Beach''; and
Whereas the State of Alaska has passed Sen. Con. Res. 37, as sent to the 
  State Geographic Board, which names this beach ``Arkansas Beach'': 
  Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

53,51"N, 166 degrees 34,15"W to 53 degrees 53,48"N, 166 degrees 34,21"W
