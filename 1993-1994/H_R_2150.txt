SEC. 701. GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES AGREEMENT.

    The Agreement between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Russian Federation on Mutual Fisheries 
Relations which was entered into on May 31, 1988, and which expired by 
its terms on October 28, 1993, may be brought into force again for the 
United States through an exchange of notes between the United States of 
America and the Russian Federation and may remain in force and effect on 
the part of the United States until May 1, 1994, and may be amended or 
extended by a subsequent agreement to which section 203 of the Magnuson 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1823) applies.

SEC. 702. SHRIMP TRAWL FISHERY.

    Section 304(g)(6)(B) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1854(g)(6)(B)) is amended by striking 
``January 1, 1994'' and inserting ``April 1, 1994''.
    SEC. 703. INTERNATIONAL FISHERY CONSERVATION IN THE CENTRAL BERING 
      SEA.
    It is the sense of the Congress that--
        (1) the United States should take appropriate measures to 
    conserve the resources of the Doughnut Hole, a small enclave of 
    international waters in the central Bering Sea, encircled by the 
    Exclusive Economic Zones of the United States and the Russian 
    Federation;
        (2) the United States should continue its pursuit of an 
    international agreement, consistent with its rights as a coastal 
    state, to ensure proper management for future commercial viability 
    of these natural resources;
        (3) the United States, working closely with the Russian 
    Federation should, in accordance with international law and through 
    multilateral consultations or through other means, promote effective 
    international programs for the implementation and enforcement of 
    regulations of the fisheries by those nations that fish in the 
    Doughnut Hole;
        (4) the United States nonetheless should be mindful of its 
    management responsibility in this regard and of its rights in 
    accordance with international law to fully utilize the stock within 
    its own exclusive economic zone;
        (5) the United States should accept as an urgent duty the need 
    to conserve for future generations the Aleutian Basin pollock stock 
    and should carry out that duty by taking all necessary measures, in 
    accordance with international law; and
        (6) the United States should foster further multilateral 
    cooperation leading to international consensus on management of the 
    Doughnut Hole resources through the fullest use of diplomatic 
    channels and appropriate domestic and international law and should 
    explore all other available options and means for conservation and 
    management of these living marine resources.

SEC. 704. NOAA FACILITIES IN KODIAK.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of 
Commerce may enter into an agreement with the University of Alaska under 
which the University may contract for the engineering and design

meets the long-term space needs of National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration personnel currently located in Alaska.
    (b) The Secretary may transfer available funds to the University of 
Alaska to pay for such engineering and design work if additional funds 
in an equal or greater amount are made available from non-Federal 
sources for such work.
                 TITLE VIII--ATLANTIC COASTAL FISHERIES

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Atlantic Coastal Fisheries 
Cooperative Management Act''.

SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
        (1) Coastal fishery resources that migrate, or are widely 
    distributed, across the jurisdictional boundaries of two or more of 
    the Atlantic States and of the Federal Government are of substantial 
    commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the 
    Atlantic coastal region and the Nation.
        (2) Increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, and the 
    loss and alteration of habitat have reduced severely certain 
    Atlantic coastal fishery resources.
        (3) Because no single governmental entity has exclusive 
    management authority for Atlantic coastal fishery resources, 
    harvesting of such resources in frequently subject to disparate, 
    inconsistent, and intermittent State and Federal regulation that has 
    been detrimental to the conservation and sustainable use of such 
    resources and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a 
    whole.
        (4) The responsibility for managing Atlantic coastal fisheries 
    rests with the States, which carry out a cooperative program of 
    fishery oversight and management through the Atlantic States Marine 
    Fisheries Commission. It is the responsibility of the Federal 
    Government to support such cooperative interstate management of 
    coastal fishery resources.
        (5) The failure by one or more Atlantic States to fully 
    implement a coastal fishery management plan can affect the status of 
    Atlantic coastal fisheries, and can discourage other States from 
    fully implementing coastal fishery management plans.
        (6) It is in the national interest to provide for more effective 
    Atlantic State fishery resource conservation and management.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to support and encourage 
the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate 
conservation and management of Atlantic coastal fishery resources.

    SEC. 805. STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF COASTAL FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS.
    (a) Coastal Fishery Management Plans.--(1) The Commission shall 
prepare and adopt coastal fishery management plans to provide for the 
conservation of coastal fishery resources. In preparing a coastal 
fishery management plan for a fishery that is located in both State 
waters and the exclusive economic zone, the Commission shall consult 
with appropriate Councils to determine areas where such coastal fishery 
management plan may complement Council fishery management plans. The 
coastal fishery management plan shall specify the requirements necessary 
for States to be in compliance with the plan. Upon adoption of a coastal 
fishery management plan, the Commission shall identify each State that 
is required to implement and enforce that plan.
    (2) Within 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Commission shall establish standards and procedures to govern the 
preparation of coastal fishery management plans under this title, 
including standards and procedures to ensure that--
        (A) such plans promote the conservation of fish stocks 
    throughout their ranges and are based on the best scientific 
    information available; and
        (B) the Commission provides adequate opportunity for public 
    participation in the plan preparation process, including at least 
    four public hearings and procedures for the submission of written 
    comments to the Commission.
    (b) State Implementation and Enforcement.--(1) Each State identified 
under subsection (a) with respect to a coastal fishery management plan 
shall implement and enforce the measures of such plan within the 
timeframe established in the plan.
    (2) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Commission shall establish a schedule of timeframes within which States 
shall implement and enforce the measures of coastal fishery management 
plans in existence before such date of enactment. No such timeframe 
shall exceed 12 months after the date on which the schedule is adopted.
    (c) Commission Monitoring of State Implementation and Enforcement.--
The Commission shall, at least annually, review each State's 
implementation and enforcement of coastal fishery management plans for 
the purpose of determining whether such State is effectively 
implementing and enforcing each such plan. Upon completion of such 
reviews, the Commission shall report the results of the reviews to the 
Secretaries.
    SEC. 806. STATE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COASTAL FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS.
    (a) Noncompliance Determination.--The Commission shall determine 
that a State is not in compliance with the provisions of a coastal 
fishery management plan if it finds that the State has not implemented 
and enforced such plan within the timeframes established under the plan 
or under section 805.
    (b) Notification.--Upon making any determination under subsection 
(a), the Commission shall within 10 working days notify the Secretaries 
of such determination. Such notification shall include the reasons for 
making the determination and an explicit list of actions that the 
affected State must take to comply with the coastal fishery management 
plan. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notification to the 
affected State.
    (c) Withdrawal of Noncompliance Determination.--After making a 
determination under subsection (a), the Commission shall continue to 
monitor State implementation and enforcement. Upon finding that a State 
has complied with the actions required under subsection (b), the 
Commission shall immediately withdraw its determination of 
noncompliance. The Commission shall promptly notify the Secretaries of 
such withdrawal.

SEC. 807. SECRETARIAL ACTION.

    (a) Secretarial Review of Commission Determination of 
Noncompliance.--Within 30 days after receiving a notification from the 
Commission under section 806(b) and after review of the Commission's 
determination of noncompliance, the Secretary shall make a finding on--
        (1) whether the State in question has failed to carry out its 
    responsibility under section 805; and
        (2) if so, whether the measures that the State has failed to 
    implement and enforce are necessary for the conservation of the 
    fishery in question.
    (b) Consideration of Comments.--In making a finding under subsection 
(a), the Secretary shall--
        (A) give careful consideration to the comments of the State that 
    the Commission has determined under section 806(a) is not in 
    compliance with a coastal fishery management plan, and provide such 
    State, upon request, with the opportunity to meet with and present 
    its comments directly to the Secretary; and
        (B) solicit and consider the comments of the Commission and the 
    appropriate Councils.
    (c) Moratorium.--(1) Upon making a finding under subsection (a) that 
a State has failed to carry out its responsibility under section 805 and 
that the measures it failed to implement and enforce are necessary for 
conservation, the Secretary shall declare a moratorium on fishing in the 
fishery in question within the waters of the noncomplying State. The 
Secretary shall specify the moratorium's effective date, which shall be 
any date within 6 months after declaration of the moratorium.
    (2) If after a moratorium is declared under paragraph (1) the 
Secretary is notified by the Commission that the Commission is 
withdrawing under section 806(c) the determination of noncompliance, the 
Secretary shall immediately determine whether the State is in compliance 
with the applicable plan. If so, the moratorium shall be terminated.
    (d) Implementing Regulations.--The Secretary may issue regulations 
necessary to implement this section. Such regulations--
        (1) may provide for the possession and use of fish which have 
    been produced in an aquaculture operation, subject to applicable 
    State regulations; and
        (2) shall allow for retention of fish that are subject to a 
    moratorium declared under this section and unavoidably taken as 
    incidental catch in fisheries directed toward menhaden if--
            (A) discarding the retained fish is impracticable;
            (B) the retained fish do not constitute a significant 
        portion of the catch of the vessel; and
            (C) retention of the fish will not, in the judgment of the 
        Secretary, adversely affect the conservation of the species of 
        fish retained.
    (e) Prohibited Acts During Moratorium.--During the time in which a 
moratorium under this section is in effect, it is unlawful for any 
person to--
        (1) violate the terms of the moratorium or of any implementing 
    regulation issued under subsection (d);
        (2) engage in fishing for any species of fish to which the 
    moratorium applies within the waters of the State subject to the 
    moratorium;
        (3) land, attempt to land, or possess fish that are caught, 
    taken, or harvested in violation of the moratorium or of any 
    implementing regulation issued under subsection (d);
        (4) fail to return to the water immediately, with a minimum of 
    injury, any fish to which the moratorium applies that are taken 
    incidental to fishing for species other than those to which the 
    moratorium applies, except as provided by regulations issued under 
    subsection (d);
        (5) refuse to permit any officer authorized to enforce the 
    provisions of this title to board a fishing vessel subject to such 
    person's control for purposes of conducting any search or inspection 
    in connection with the enforcement of this title;
        (6) forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or 
    interfere with any such authorized officer in the conduct of any 
    search or inspection under this title;
        (7) resist a lawful arrest for any act prohibited by this 
    section;
        (8) ship, transport, offer for sale, sell, purchase, import, or 
    have custody, control, or possession of, any fish taken or retained
