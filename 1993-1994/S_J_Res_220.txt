        S.J.Res. 220

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate October 19, 1994, as ``National Mammography Day''.

Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, 182,000 women will 
  be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994, and 46,000 women will die 
  from this disease;
Whereas, in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that about two 
  million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, resulting in 
  nearly 500,000 deaths;
Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with 50 percent 
  of the breast cancer cases occurring in women over age 65;
Whereas 80 percent of women who get breast cancer have no family 
  history of the disease;
Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at an accredited 
  facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;
Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method of early 
  detection of breast cancer, and early detection is the key to saving 
  lives; and
Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to two 
  years before regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-
  examinations (BSE), saving as many as a third more lives: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That October 19, 1994, be 
designated as ``National Mammography Day'', and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the 
people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate 
programs and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
