              ``PART D--FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM

``SEC. 451. PROGRAM AUTHORITY.

    There are hereby made available, in accordance with the provisions 
of this part, such sums as may be necessary to make loans to all 
eligible students (and the eligible parents of such students) in 
attendance at participating institutions of higher education selected by 
the Secretary, to enable such students to pursue their courses of study 
at such institutions during the period beginning July 1, 1994. Such 
loans shall be made by participating institutions, or consortia thereof, 
that have agreements with the Secretary to originate loans, or by 
alternative originators designated by the Secretary to make loans for 
students in attendance at participating institutions (and their 
parents).
``SEC. 452. FUNDS FOR ORIGINATION OF DIRECT STUDENT LOANS.
    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall provide, on the basis of the 
need and the eligibility of students at each participating institution, 
and parents of such students, for such loans, funds for student and 
parent loans under this part--
        ``(1) directly to an institution of higher education that has an 
    agreement with the Secretary under section 454(a) to participate in 
    the direct student loan programs under this part and that also has 
    an agreement with the Secretary under section 454(b) to originate 
    loans under this part; or
        ``(2) through an alternative originator designated by the 
    Secretary to students (and parents of students) attending 
    institutions of higher education that have an agreement with the 
    Secretary under section 454(a) but that do not have an agreement 
    with the Secretary under section 454(b).
    ``(b) Fees for Origination Services.--
        ``(1) Fees for institutions.--The Secretary shall pay fees to 
    institutions of higher education (or a consortium of such 
    institutions) with agreements under section 454(b), in an amount 
    established by the Secretary, to assist in meeting the costs of loan 
    origination. Such fees--
            ``(A) shall be paid by the Secretary based on all the loans 
        made under this part to a particular borrower in the same 
        academic year;
            ``(B) shall be subject to a sliding scale that decreases the 
        per borrower amount of such fees as the number of borrowers 
        increases; and
            ``(C)(i) for academic year 1994-1995, shall not exceed a 
        program-wide average of $10 per borrower for all the loans made 
        under this part to such borrower in the same academic year; and
            ``(ii) for succeeding academic years, shall not exceed such 
        average fee as the Secretary shall establish pursuant to 
        regulations.
        ``(2) Fees for alternative originators.--The Secretary shall pay 
    fees for loan origination services to alternative originators of 
    loans made under this part in an amount established by the Secretary 
    in accordance with the terms of the contract described in section 
    456(b) between the Secretary and each such alternative originator.
    ``(c) No Entitlement To Participate or Originate.--No institution of 
higher education shall have a right to participate in the programs 
authorized by this part, to originate loans, or to perform any program 
function under this part. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed 
so as to limit the entitlement of an eligible student attending a 
participating institution (or the eligible parent of such student) to 
borrow under this part.
    ``(d) Delivery of Loan Funds.--Loan funds shall be paid and 
delivered to an institution by the Secretary prior to the beginning of 
the payment period established by the Secretary in a manner that is 
consistent with payment and delivery of basic grants under subpart 1 of 
part A of this title.
``SEC. 453. SELECTION OF INSTITUTIONS FOR PARTICIPATION AND ORIGINATION.
    ``(a) Phase-In of Program.--
        ``(1) General authority.--The Secretary shall enter into 
    agreements pursuant to section 454(a) with institutions of higher 
    education to participate in the direct student loan program under 
    this part, and agreements pursuant to section 454(b) with 
    institutions of higher education, or consortia thereof, to originate 
    loans in such program, for academic years beginning on or after July 
    1, 1994. Alternative origination services, through which an entity 
    other than the participating institution at which the student is in 
    attendance originates the loan, shall be provided by the Secretary, 
    through 1 or more contracts under section 456(b) or such other means 
    as the Secretary may provide, for students attending participating 
    institutions that do not originate direct student loans under this 
    part. Such agreements for the academic year 1994-1995 shall, to the 
    extent feasible, be entered into not later than January 1, 1994.
        ``(2) Transition provisions.--In order to ensure an expeditious 
    but orderly transition from the loan programs under part B of this 
    title to the direct student loan program under this part, the 
    Secretary shall, in the exercise of the Secretary's discretion, 
    determine the number of institutions with which the Secretary shall 
    enter into agreements under subsections (a) and (b) of section 454 
    for any academic year, except that the Secretary shall exercise such 
    discretion so as to achieve the following goals:
            ``(A) for academic year 1994-1995, loans made under this 
        part shall represent 5 percent of the new student loan volume 
        for such year;
            ``(B) for academic year 1995-1996, loans made under this 
        part shall represent 40 percent of the new student loan volume 
        for such year;

        loan volume for such years; and
            ``(D) for the academic year that begins in fiscal year 1998, 
        loans made under this part shall represent 60 percent of the new 
        student loan volume for such year.
        ``(3) Exception.--The Secretary may exceed the percentage goals 
    described in subparagraphs (C) or (D) of paragraph (2) if the 
    Secretary determines that a higher percentage is warranted by the 
    number of institutions of higher education that desire to 
    participate in the program under this part and that meet the 
    eligibility requirements for such participation.
        ``(4) New student loan volume.--For the purpose of this 
    subsection, the term `new student loan volume' means the estimated 
    sum of all loans (other than consolidation loans) that will be made, 
    insured or guaranteed under this part and part B in the year for 
    which the determination is made. The Secretary shall base the 
    estimate described in the preceding sentence on the most recent 
    program data available.
    ``(b) Selection Criteria.--
        ``(1) Application.--Each institution of higher education 
    desiring to participate in the direct student loan program under 
    this part shall submit an application satisfactory to the Secretary

    require.

    such other eligibility requirements as the Secretary shall 
    prescribe, by, to the extent possible--

        anticipated loan volume, length of academic program, control of 
        the institution, highest degree offered, size of student 
        enrollment, geographic location, annual loan volume, and default 
        experience; and
            ``(ii) beginning in academic year 1995-1996 selecting

        determined by the Secretary in accordance with section 
        428(b)(1)(L);
            ``(C) a graduated repayment plan, with annual repayment 
        amounts established at 2 or more graduated levels and paid over 
        a fixed or extended period of time, except that the borrower's 
        scheduled payments shall not be less than 50 percent, nor more 
        than 150 percent, of what the amortized payment on the amount 
        owed would be if the loan were repaid under the standard 
        repayment plan; and

        annual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower, 
        paid over an extended period of time prescribed by the

    and conditions as may be established by the Secretary.
        ``(4) Alternative repayment plans.--The Secretary may provide, 
    on a case by case basis, an alternative repayment plan to a borrower 
    of a loan made under this part who demonstrates to the satisfaction 
    of the Secretary that the terms and conditions of the repayment 
    plans available under paragraph (1) are not adequate to accommodate 
    the borrower's exceptional circumstances. In designing such 
    alternative repayment plans, the Secretary shall ensure that such 
    plans do not exceed the cost to the Federal Government, as 
    determined on the basis of the present value of future payments by 
    such borrowers, of loans made using the plans available under 
    paragraph (1).
        ``(5) Repayment after default.--The Secretary may require any 
    borrower who has defaulted on a loan made under this part to--
            ``(A) pay all reasonable collection costs associated with 
        such loan; and
            ``(B) repay the loan pursuant to an income contingent 
        repayment plan.

    borrower (and the borrower's spouse, if applicable) of a loan made 
    under this part that is, or may be, repaid pursuant to income 
    contingent repayment, for the purpose of determining the annual 
    repayment obligation of the borrower. Returns and return information 
    (as defined in section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) 
    may be obtained under the preceding sentence only to the extent 
    authorized by section 6103(l)(13) of such Code. The Secretary shall 
    establish procedures for determining the borrower's repayment 
    obligation on that loan for such year, and such other procedures as 
    are necessary to implement effectively income contingent repayment.
        ``(2) Repayment based on adjusted gross income.--A repayment 
    schedule for a loan made under this part and repaid pursuant to 
    income contingent repayment shall be based on the adjusted gross

    1986) of the borrower or, if the borrower is married and files a 
    Federal income tax return jointly with the borrower's spouse, on the

        ``(3) Additional documents.--A borrower who chooses, or is 
    required, to repay a loan made under this part pursuant to income 
    contingent repayment, and for whom adjusted gross income is 
    unavailable or does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current 
    income, shall provide to the Secretary other documentation of income 
    satisfactory to the Secretary, which documentation the Secretary may 
    use to determine an appropriate repayment schedule.
        ``(4) Repayment schedules.--Income contingent repayment 
    schedules shall be established by regulations promulgated by the 
    Secretary and shall require payments that vary in relation to the 
    appropriate portion of the annual income of the borrower (and the 
    borrower's spouse, if applicable) as determined by the Secretary.
        ``(5) Calculation of balance due.--The balance due on a loan 
    made under this part that is repaid pursuant to income contingent 
    repayment shall equal the unpaid principal amount of the loan, any 
    accrued interest, and any fees, such as late charges, assessed on 
    such loan. The Secretary may promulgate regulations limiting the 
    amount of interest that may be capitalized on such loan, and the 
    timing of any such capitalization.
        ``(6) Notification to borrowers.--The Secretary shall establish 
    procedures under which a borrower of a loan made under this part who 
    chooses or is required to repay such loan pursuant to income 
    contingent repayment is notified of the terms and conditions of such 
    plan, including notification of such borrower--
            ``(A) that the Internal Revenue Service will disclose to the 
        Secretary tax return information as authorized under section 
        6103(l)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
            ``(B) that if a borrower considers that special 
        circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or 
        the borrower's spouse, warrant an adjustment in the borrower's 
        loan repayment as determined using the information described in 
        subparagraph (A), or the alternative documentation described in 
        paragraph (3), the borrower may contact the Secretary, who shall 
        determine whether such adjustment is appropriate, in accordance

``SEC. 112. NATIONAL SPECTRUM ALLOCATION PLANNING.

    ``The Assistant Secretary and the Chairman of the Commission shall 
meet, at least biannually, to conduct joint spectrum planning with 
respect to the following issues:
        ``(1) the extent to which licenses for spectrum use can be 
    issued pursuant to section 309(j) of the 1934 Act to increase 
    Federal revenues;
        ``(2) the future spectrum requirements for public and private

    spectrum, including spectrum management techniques to promote 
    increased shared use of the spectrum that does not cause harmful 
    interference as a means of increasing commercial access.
``SEC. 113. IDENTIFICATION OF REALLOCABLE FREQUENCIES.
    ``(a) Identification Required.--The Secretary shall, within 18 
months after the date of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993, prepare and submit to the President and the 
Congress a report identifying and recommending for reallocation bands of 
frequencies--
        ``(1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal 
    Government use;
        ``(2) that are not required for the present or identifiable 
    future needs of the Federal Government;

        ``(4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will 
    not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of services 
    or benefits to the public, that are excessive in relation to the 
    benefits to the public that may be provided by non-Federal 
    licensees; and
        ``(5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for 
    productive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act if allocated 
    for non-Federal use.
    ``(b) Minimum Amount of Spectrum Recommended.--
        ``(1) In general.--In accordance with the provisions of this 
    section, the Secretary shall recommend for reallocation, for use 
    other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 
    1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that in the aggregate 
    span not less than 200 megahertz, that are located below 5 
    gigahertz, and that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) 
    through (5) of subsection (a). Such bands of frequencies shall 
    include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that span 
    in the aggregate not less than 100 megahertz.
        ``(2) Mixed uses permitted to be counted.--Bands of frequencies 
    which a report of the Secretary under subsection (a) or (d)(1) 
    recommends be partially retained for use by Federal Government 
    stations, but which are also recommended to be reallocated to be 
    made available under the 1934 Act for use by non-Federal stations, 
    may be counted toward the minimum spectrum required by paragraph (1) 
    of this subsection, except that--
            ``(A) the bands of frequencies counted under this paragraph 
        may not count toward more than one-half of the minimums required 
        by paragraph (1) of this subsection;

        paragraph unless the assignments of the band to Federal 
        Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 
        305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by other means 
        so as to guarantee that the potential use to be made by such 
        Federal Government stations is substantially less (as measured 
        by geographic area, time, or otherwise) than the potential use 
        to be made by non-Federal stations; and
            ``(C) the operational sharing permitted under this paragraph 
        shall be subject to the interference regulations prescribed by 
        the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of the 1934 Act and to 
        coordination procedures that the Commission and the Secretary 
        shall jointly establish and implement to ensure against harmful 
        interference.
    ``(c) Criteria for Identification.--
        ``(1) Needs of the federal government.--In determining whether a 
    band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection 
    (a)(2), the Secretary shall--
            ``(A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to 
        provide a communications service that is or could be available 
        from a commercial provider or other vendor;
            ``(B) seek to promote--
                ``(i) the maximum practicable reliance on commercially 
            available substitutes;
                ``(ii) the sharing of frequencies (as permitted under 
            subsection (b)(2));

            users of Federal Government services; and
                ``(iii) excessive disruption of existing use of Federal 
            Government frequencies by amateur radio licensees.
        ``(2) Feasibility of use.--In determining whether a frequency 
    band meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(3), the 
    Secretary shall--
            ``(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the 
        Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 303) 
        within 15 years;

            ``(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to 
        reestablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.
        ``(3) Analysis of benefits.--In determining whether a band of 
    frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5), the 
    Secretary shall consider--
            ``(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available 
        that is capable of utilizing the band;
            ``(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already assigned 
        for commercial or other non-Federal use;
            ``(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users 
        could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees; and
            ``(D) the activities of foreign governments in making 
        frequencies available for experimentation or commercial 
        assignments in order to support their domestic manufacturers of 
        equipment.
        ``(4) Power agency frequencies.--
            ``(A) Applicability of criteria.--The criteria specified by 
        subsection (a) shall be deemed not to be met for any purpose 
        under this part with regard to any frequency assignment to, or 
        any frequency assignment used by, a Federal power agency for the 
        purpose of withdrawing that assignment.
            ``(B) Mixed use eligibility.--The frequencies assigned to 
        any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed use 
        under subsection (b)(2) in geographically separate areas, but in 
        those cases where a frequency is to be shared by an affected 
        Federal power agency and a non-Federal user, such use by the 
        non-Federal user shall not cause harmful interference to the 
        affected Federal power agency or adversely affect the 
        reliability of its power system.
            ``(C) Definition.--As used in this paragraph, the term 
        `Federal power agency' means the Tennessee Valley Authority, the 
        Bonneville Power Administration, the Western Area Power 
        Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, the 
        Southeastern Power Administration, or the Alaska Power 
        Administration.
        ``(5) Limitation on reallocation.--None of the frequencies 
    recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this 
    subsection shall have been recommended, prior to the date of 
    enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, for 
    reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.

    Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Secretary shall prepare, make 
    publicly available, and submit to the President, the Congress, and 
    the Commission a report which makes a preliminary identification of 
    reallocable bands of frequencies which meet the criteria established 
    by this section.
        ``(2) Public comment.--The Secretary shall provide interested 
    persons with the opportunity to submit, within 90 days after the 
    date of its publication, written comment on the preliminary report 
    required by paragraph (1). The Secretary shall immediately transmit 
    a copy of any such comment to the Commission.
        ``(3) Comment and recommendations from commission.--The 
    Commission shall, within 90 days after the conclusion of the period 
    for comment provided pursuant to paragraph (2), submit to the 
    Secretary the Commission's analysis of such comments and the 
    Commission's recommendations for responses to such comments, 
    together with such other comments and recommendations as the 
    Commission deems appropriate.
        ``(4) Direct discussions.--The Secretary shall encourage and 
    provide opportunity for direct discussions among commercial 
    representatives and Federal Government users of the spectrum to aid 
    the Secretary in determining which frequencies to recommend for 
    reallocation. The Secretary shall provide notice to the public and 
    the Commission of any such discussions, including the name or names 
    of any businesses or other persons represented in such discussions. 
    A representative of the Commission (and of the Secretary at the 
    election of the Secretary) shall be permitted to attend any such 
    discussions. The Secretary shall provide the public and the 
    Commission with an opportunity to comment on the results of any such 
    discussions prior to the submission of the final report required by 
    subsection (a).
    ``(e) Timetable for Reallocation and Limitation.--
        ``(1) Timetable required.--The Secretary shall, as part of the 
    reports required by subsections (a) and (d)(1), include a timetable 
    that recommends effective dates by which the President shall 
    withdraw or limit assignments of the frequencies specified in such 
    reports.

    paragraph (1), a frequency may not be substituted for a frequency 
    identified and recommended by the report of the Secretary under 
    section 113(a) unless the substituted frequency also meets each of 
    the criteria specified by section 113(a).

    decisions with respect to such frequencies in a timely manner and in 
    no event later than the date required by section 7 of the 1934

SEC. 6002. AUTHORITY TO USE COMPETITIVE BIDDING.

    (a) Use of Competitive Bidding.--Section 309 of the Communications 
Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(j) Use of Competitive Bidding.--
        ``(1) General authority.--If mutually exclusive applications are 
    accepted for filing for any initial license or construction permit 
    which will involve a use of the electromagnetic spectrum described 
    in paragraph (2), then the Commission shall have the authority, 
    subject to paragraph (10), to grant such license or permit to a 
    qualified applicant through the use of a system of competitive 
    bidding that meets the requirements of this subsection.
        ``(2) Uses to which bidding may apply.--A use of the 
    electromagnetic spectrum is described in this paragraph if the 
    Commission determines that--
            ``(A) the principal use of such spectrum will involve, or is 
        reasonably likely to involve, the licensee receiving 
        compensation from subscribers in return for which the licensee--
                ``(i) enables those subscribers to receive 
            communications signals that are transmitted utilizing 
            frequencies on which the licensee is licensed to operate; or
                ``(ii) enables those subscribers to transmit directly 
            communications signals utilizing frequencies on which the 
            licensee is licensed to operate; and
            ``(B) a system of competitive bidding will promote the 
        objectives described in paragraph (3).
        ``(3) Design of systems of competitive bidding.--For each class 
    of licenses or permits that the Commission grants through the use of 
    a competitive bidding system, the Commission shall, by regulation, 
    establish a competitive bidding methodology. The Commission shall 
    seek to design and test multiple alternative methodologies under 
    appropriate circumstances. In identifying classes of licenses and 
    permits to be issued by competitive bidding, in specifying 
    eligibility and other characteristics of such licenses and permits, 
    and in designing the methodologies for use under this subsection, 
    the Commission shall include safeguards to protect the public 
    interest in the use of the spectrum and shall seek to promote the 
    purposes specified in section 1 of this Act and the following 
    objectives:
            ``(A) the development and rapid deployment of new 
        technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the 
        public, including those residing in rural areas, without 
        administrative or judicial delays;
            ``(B) promoting economic opportunity and competition and 
        ensuring that new and innovative technologies are readily 
        accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive 
        concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a 
        wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural 
        telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority 
        groups and women;
            ``(C) recovery for the public of a portion of the value of 
        the public spectrum resource made available for commercial use 
        and avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed 
        to award uses of that resource; and
            ``(D) efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic 
        spectrum.
        ``(4) Contents of regulations.--In prescribing regulations 
    pursuant to paragraph (3), the Commission shall--
            ``(A) consider alternative payment schedules and methods of 
        calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment 
        payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules 
        or methods that promote the objectives described in paragraph 
        (3)(B), and combinations of such schedules and methods;
            ``(B) include performance requirements, such as appropriate 
        deadlines and penalties for performance failures, to ensure 
        prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent 
        stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or 
        permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment of 
        new technologies and services;
            ``(C) consistent with the public interest, convenience, and 
        necessity, the purposes of this Act, and the characteristics of 
        the proposed service, prescribe area designations and bandwidth 
        assignments that promote (i) an equitable distribution of 
        licenses and services among geographic areas, (ii) economic 
        opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small 
        businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by 
        members of minority groups and women, and (iii) investment in 
        and rapid deployment of new technologies and services;
            ``(D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone 
        companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups 
        and women are given the opportunity to participate in the 
        provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, 
        consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and 
        other procedures; and
            ``(E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking 
        restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to 
        prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to 
        issue licenses and permits.
        ``(5) Bidder and licensee qualification.--No person shall be 
    permitted to participate in a system of competitive bidding pursuant 
    to this subsection unless such bidder submits such information and 
    assurances as the Commission may require to demonstrate that such 
    bidder's application is acceptable for filing. No license shall be 
    granted to an applicant selected pursuant to this subsection unless 
    the Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant 
    to subsection (a) and sections 308(b) and 310. Consistent with the 
    objectives described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall, by 
    regulation, prescribe expedited procedures consistent with the 
    procedures authorized by subsection (i)(2) for the resolution of any 
    substantial and material issues of fact concerning qualifications.
        ``(6) Rules of construction.--Nothing in this subsection, or in 
    the use of competitive bidding, shall--
            ``(A) alter spectrum allocation criteria and procedures 
        established by the other provisions of this Act;

        (d)(2) and (e) of this section);

        expectation of renewal of a license, that differ from the rights 
        that apply to other licenses within the same service that were 
        not issued pursuant to this subsection;

        obligation in the public interest to continue to use engineering 
        solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service 
        regulations, and other means in order to avoid mutual 
        exclusivity in application and licensing proceedings;

        nationwide, regional, or local licenses or permits;

        permit of the obligation to pay charges imposed pursuant to 
        section 8 of this Act.

    determinations.--
            ``(A) Consideration prohibited.--In making a decision 
        pursuant to section 303(c) to assign a band of frequencies to a 
        use for which licenses or permits will be issued pursuant to 
        this subsection, and in prescribing regulations pursuant to 
        paragraph (4)(C) of this subsection, the Commission may not base 
        a finding of public interest, convenience, and necessity on the 
        expectation of Federal revenues from the use of a system of 
        competitive bidding under this subsection.
            ``(B) Consideration limited.--In prescribing regulations 
        pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection, the Commission 
        may not base a finding of public interest, convenience, and 
        necessity solely or predominantly on the expectation of Federal 
        revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under 
        this subsection.
            ``(C) Consideration of demand for spectrum not affected.--
        Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the 
        Commission from continuing to consider consumer demand for 
        spectrum-based services.

        (A), the salaries and expenses account of the Commission shall 
        retain as an offsetting collection such sums as may be necessary 
        from such proceeds for the costs of developing and implementing 
        the program required by this subsection. Such offsetting 
        collections shall be available for obligation subject to the 
        terms and conditions of the receiving appropriations account, 
        and shall be deposited in such accounts on a quarterly basis. 
        Any funds appropriated to the Commission for fiscal years 1994 
        through 1998 for the purpose of assigning licenses using random 
        selection under subsection (i) shall be used by the Commission 
        to implement this subsection.

    not later than 5 years after the date of enactment of this 
    subsection, issue licenses and permits pursuant to this subsection

        (2) Regulatory treatment to enhance auction value of spectrum 
    licenses.--
            (A) Amendment.--Section 332 of the Communications Act of

                (iii) by striking subsection (c) and inserting the 
            following:
    ``(c) Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services.--
        ``(1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services.--
    (A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a 
    commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so 
    engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this Act, 
    except for such provisions of title II as the Commission may specify 
    by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In 
    prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not 
    specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208, and may specify 
    any other provision only if the Commission determines that--
            ``(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in 
        order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or 
        regulations for or in connection with that service are just and 
        reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;
            ``(ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for 
        the protection of consumers; and
            ``(iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the 
        public interest.
        ``(B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial 
    mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to 
    establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the 
    provisions of section 201 of this Act. Except to the extent that the 
    Commission is required to respond to such a request, this 
    subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of 
    the Commission's authority to order interconnection pursuant to this 
    Act.
        ``(C) The Commission shall review competitive market conditions 
    with respect to commercial mobile services and shall include in its 
    annual report an analysis of those conditions. Such analysis shall 
    include an identification of the number of competitors in various 
    commercial mobile services, an analysis of whether or not there is 
    effective competition, an analysis of whether any of such 
    competitors have a dominant share of the market for such services, 
    and a statement of whether additional providers or classes of 
    providers in those services would be likely to enhance competition. 
    As a part of making a determination with respect to the public 
    interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider 
    whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote 
    competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such 
    regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers 
    of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that 
    such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among 
    providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be 
    the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or 
    amendment) is in the public interest.
        ``(D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after the 
    date of enactment of this subparagraph, complete a rulemaking 
    required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing 
    of personal communications services, including making any 
    determinations required by subparagraph (C).
        ``(2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services.--
    A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private 
    mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be 
    treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this Act. A common 
    carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a 
    private land mobile service prior to the enactment of the Omnibus 
    Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993) shall not provide any dispatch 
    service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, 
    except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations 
    licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before 
    January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in 
    whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding 
    sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will 
    serve the public interest.
        ``(3) State preemption.--(A) Notwithstanding sections 2(b) and 
    221(b), no State or local government shall have any authority to 
    regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile 
    service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph 
    shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and 
    conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this 
    subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services 
    (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone 
    exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications 
    within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission 
    on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure 
    the universal availability of telecommunications service at 
    affordable rates. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this 
    subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to 
    regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the 
    Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates 
    that--
            ``(i) market conditions with respect to such services fail 
        to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable 
        rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;

        replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a 
        substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service 
        within such State.
    The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public 
    comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months 
    after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If 
    the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize 
    the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for 
    such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure 
    that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or 
    unreasonably discriminatory.
        ``(B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation 
    concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in 
    such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after 
    the date of enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
    1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be 
    authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a 
    State files such a petition, the State's existing regulation shall, 
    notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the 
    Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on 
    such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in 
    accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, 
    shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 
    months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition 
    if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph 
    (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the 
    Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law 
    such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the 
    Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and 
    reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a 
    reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has 
    elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this 
    subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for 
    an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such 
    subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for 
    commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly 
    or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide 
    reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such 
    petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its 
    submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.
        ``(4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite 
    corporation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter 
    or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the 
    Communications Satellite Act of 1962 of the corporation authorized 
    by title III of such Act.
        ``(5) Space segment capacity.--Nothing in this section shall 
    prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the 
    provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to 
    providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common 
    carriage.
        ``(6) Foreign ownership.--The Commission, upon a petition for 
    waiver filed within 6 months after the date of enactment of the 
    Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, may waive the application 
    of section 310(b) to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed 
    before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile 
    service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the 
    enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only 
    upon the following conditions:
            ``(A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be 
        increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.
            ``(B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer 
        of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b).
    ``(d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
        ``(1) the term `commercial mobile service' means any mobile 
    service (as defined in section 3(n)) that is provided for profit and 
    makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to 
    such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a 
    substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the 
    Commission;
        ``(2) the term `interconnected service' means service that is 
    interconnected with the public switched network (as such terms are 
    defined by regulation by the Commission) or service for which a 
    request for interconnection is pending pursuant to subsection 
    (c)(1)(B); and
        ``(3) the term `private mobile service' means any mobile service 
    (as defined in section 3(n)) that is not a commercial mobile service

    specified by regulation by the Commission.''.
            (B) Additional conforming amendments.--(i) Section 2(b) of

        consequence of such amendments), shall make such other 
        modifications or terminations as may be necessary and practical 
        to assure that licensees in such service are subjected to

SEC. 6003. ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FEES.

    (a) Regulatory Fees.--
        (1) Amendment.--Title I of the Communications Act of 1934 is 
    amended by inserting after section 8 the following new section:

``SEC. 9. REGULATORY FEES.

    ``(a) General Authority.--The Commission, in accordance with this 
section, shall assess and collect regulatory fees to recover the costs 
of the following regulatory activities of the Commission: enforcement 
activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, 
and international activities.
    ``(b) Establishment and Adjustment of Regulatory Fees.--
        ``(1) In general.--The fees assessed under subsection (a) 
    shall--
            ``(A) be derived by determining the full-time equivalent 
        number of employees performing the activities described in 
        subsection (a) within the Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media 
        Bureau, Common Carrier Bureau, and other offices of the 
        Commission, adjusted to take into account factors that are 
        reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the 
        fee by the Commission's activities, including such factors as 
        service area coverage, shared use versus exclusive use, and 
        other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in 
        the public interest;
            ``(B) be established at amounts that will result in 
        collection, during each fiscal year, of an amount that can 
        reasonably be expected to equal the amount appropriated for such 
        fiscal year for the performance of the activities described in 
        subsection (a); and
            ``(C) until adjusted or amended by the Commission pursuant 
        to paragraph (2) or (3), be the fees established by the Schedule 
        of Regulatory Fees in subsection (g).
        ``(2) Mandatory adjustment of schedule.--For any fiscal year 
    after fiscal year 1994, the Commission shall, by rule, revise the 
    Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate increases or decreases 
    to reflect, in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), changes in the 
    amount appropriated for the performance of the activities described 
    in subsection (a) for such fiscal year. Such proportionate increases 
    or decreases shall--
            ``(A) be adjusted to reflect, within the overall amounts 
        described in appropriations Acts under the authority of 
        paragraph (1)(A), unexpected increases or decreases in the 
        number of licensees or units subject to payment of such fees; 
        and
            ``(B) be established at amounts that will result in 
        collection of an aggregate amount of fees pursuant to this 
        section that can reasonably be expected to equal the aggregate 
        amount of fees that are required to be collected by 
        appropriations Acts pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).
    Increases or decreases in fees made by adjustments pursuant to this 
    paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review. In making 
    adjustments pursuant to this paragraph the Commission may round such 
    fees to the nearest $5 in the case of fees under $1,000, or to the 
    nearest $25 in the case of fees of $1,000 or more.
        ``(3) Permitted amendments.--In addition to the adjustments 
    required by paragraph (2), the Commission shall, by regulation, 
    amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines 
    that the Schedule requires amendment to comply with the requirements 
    of paragraph (1)(A). In making such amendments, the Commission shall 
    add, delete, or reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect 
    additions, deletions, or changes in the nature of its services as a 
    consequence of Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in law. 
    Increases or decreases in fees made by amendments pursuant to this 
    paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review.
        ``(4) Notice to congress.--The Commission shall--
            ``(A) transmit to the Congress notification of any 
        adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (2) immediately upon the 
        adoption of such adjustment; and
            ``(B) transmit to the Congress notification of any amendment 
        made pursuant to paragraph (3) not later than 90 days before the 
        effective date of such amendment.
    ``(c) Enforcement.--
        ``(1) Penalties for late payment.--The Commission shall 
    prescribe by regulation an additional charge which shall be assessed 
    as a penalty for late payment of fees required by subsection (a) of 
    this section. Such penalty shall be 25 percent of the amount of the 
    fee which was not paid in a timely manner.
        ``(2) Dismissal of applications for filings.--The Commission may 
    dismiss any application or other filing for failure to pay in a 
    timely manner any fee or penalty under this section.
        ``(3) Revocations.--In addition to or in lieu of the penalties 
    and dismissals authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2), the Commission 
    may revoke any instrument of authorization held by any entity that 
    has failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to 
    this section. Such revocation action may be taken by the Commission 
    after notice of the Commission's intent to take such action is sent 
    to the licensee by registered mail, return receipt requested, at the 
    licensee's last known address. The notice will provide the licensee 
    at least 30 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee 
    does not apply to the licensee or should otherwise be waived or 
    payment deferred. A hearing is not required under this subsection 
    unless the licensee's response presents a substantial and material 
    question of fact. In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant 
    to this section, the hearing shall be based on written evidence 
    only, and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence 
    and the burden of proof shall be on the licensee. Unless the 
    licensee substantially prevails in the hearing, the Commission may 
    assess the licensee for the costs of such hearing. Any Commission 
    order adopted pursuant to this subsection shall determine the amount 
    due, if any, and provide the licensee with at least 30 days to pay 
    that amount or have its authorization revoked. No order of 
    revocation under this subsection shall become final until the 
    licensee has exhausted its right to judicial review of such order 
    under section 402(b)(5) of this title.
    ``(d) Waiver, Reduction, and Deferment.--The Commission may waive, 
reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance for good 
cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.
    ``(e) Deposit of Collections.--Moneys received from fees established 
under this section shall be deposited as an offsetting collection in, 
and credited to, the account providing appropriations to carry out the 
functions of the Commission.
    ``(f) Regulations.--
        ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall prescribe appropriate 
    rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section. 
    Such rules and regulations shall permit payment by installments in 
    the case of fees in large amounts, and in the case of fees in small 
    amounts, shall require the payment of the fee in advance for a 
    number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the 
    payor.
    ``(g) Schedule.--Until amended by the Commission pursuant to 
subsection (b), the Schedule of Regulatory Fees which the Federal 
Communications Commission shall, subject to subsection (a)(2), assess 
and collect shall be as follows:

        outlier payments under subsection (d)(5)(A) of such section) 
        during the period of applicability described in subparagraph (B) 
        and the aggregate payment that would have been made to the 
        hospital under such section if, during the period of 
        applicability, section 1886(d)(5)(G) of such Act had been 
        applied as if the amendments made by paragraph (1) had been in 
        effect.

        adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under such 
        paragraph, but only if the average standardized amount

support, which a State is required to have in effect under section 
1902(a)(60), are as follows:
        ``(1) A law that prohibits an insurer from denying enrollment of 
    a child under the health coverage of the child's parent on the 
    ground that--
            ``(A) the child was born out of wedlock,
            ``(B) the child is not claimed as a dependent on the 
        parent's Federal income tax return, or
            ``(C) the child does not reside with the parent or in the 
        insurer's service area.
        ``(2) In any case in which a parent is required by a court or 
    administrative order to provide health coverage for a child and the 
    parent is eligible for family health coverage through an insurer, a 
    law that requires such insurer--
            ``(A) to permit such parent to enroll under such family 
        coverage any such child who is otherwise eligible for such 
        coverage (without regard to any enrollment season restrictions);
            ``(B) if such a parent is enrolled but fails to make 
        application to obtain coverage of such child, to enroll such 
        child under such family coverage upon application by the child's 
        other parent or by the State agency administering the program 
        under this title or part D of title IV; and
            ``(C) not to disenroll (or eliminate coverage of) such a 
        child unless the insurer is provided satisfactory written 
        evidence that--
                ``(i) such court or administrative order is no longer in 
            effect, or
                ``(ii) the child is or will be enrolled in comparable 
            health coverage through another insurer which will take 
            effect not later than the effective date of such 
            disenrollment.
        ``(3) In any case in which a parent is required by a court or 
    administrative order to provide health coverage for a child and the 
    parent is eligible for family health coverage through an employer 
    doing business in the State, a law that requires such employer--
            ``(A) to permit such parent to enroll under such family 
        coverage any such child who is otherwise eligible for such 
        coverage (without regard to any enrollment season restrictions);
            ``(B) if such a parent is enrolled but fails to make 
        application to obtain coverage of such child, to enroll such 
        child under such family coverage upon application by the child's 
        other parent or by the State agency administering the program 
        under this title or part D of title IV; and
            ``(C) not to disenroll (or eliminate coverage of) any such 
        child unless--
                ``(i) the employer is provided satisfactory written 
            evidence that--

                    ``(I) such court or administrative order is no 
                longer in effect, or

                    ``(II) the child is or will be enrolled in 
                comparable health coverage which will take effect not 
                later than the effective date of such disenrollment, or

                ``(ii) the employer has eliminated family health 
            coverage for all of its employees; and
            ``(D) to withhold from such employee's compensation the 
        employee's share (if any) of premiums for health coverage 
        (except that the amount so withheld may not exceed the maximum 
        amount permitted to be withheld under section 303(b) of the 
        Consumer Credit Protection Act), and to pay such share of 
        premiums to the insurer, except that the Secretary may provide 
        by regulation for appropriate circumstances under which an 
        employer may withhold less than such employee's share of such 
        premiums.
        ``(4) A law that prohibits an insurer from imposing requirements 
    on a State agency, which has been assigned the rights of an 
    individual eligible for medical assistance under this title and 
    covered for health benefits from the insurer, that are different 
    from requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other 
    individual so covered.
        ``(5) A law that requires an insurer, in any case in which a 
    child has health coverage through the insurer of a noncustodial 
    parent--
            ``(A) to provide such information to the custodial parent as 
        may be necessary for the child to obtain benefits through such 
        coverage;
            ``(B) to permit the custodial parent (or provider, with the 
        custodial parent's approval) to submit claims for covered 
        services without the approval of the noncustodial parent; and
            ``(C) to make payment on claims submitted in accordance with 
        subparagraph (B) directly to such custodial parent, the 
        provider, or the State agency.
        ``(6) A law that permits the State agency under this title to 
    garnish the wages, salary, or other employment income of, and 
    requires withholding amounts from State tax refunds to, any person 
    who--
            ``(A) is required by court or administrative order to 
        provide coverage of the costs of health services to a child who 
        is eligible for medical assistance under this title,
            ``(B) has received payment from a third party for the costs 
        of such services to such child, but
            ``(C) has not used such payments to reimburse, as 
        appropriate, either the other parent or guardian of such child 
        or the provider of such services,
    to the extent necessary to reimburse the State agency for 
    expenditures for such costs under its plan under this title, but any 
    claims for current or past-due child support shall take priority 
    over any such claims for the costs of such services.
    ``(b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term `insurer' 
includes a group health plan, as defined in section 607(1) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a health maintenance 
organization, and an entity offering a service benefit plan.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
amendments made by this section apply to calendar quarters beginning on 
or after April 1, 1994, without regard to whether or not final 
regulations to carry out such amendments have been promulgated by such 
date.
    (2) In the case of a State plan under title XIX of the Social 
Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines 
requires State legislation in order for the plan to meet the additional 
requirements imposed by the amendments made by this section, the State 
plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the requirements of 
such title solely on the basis of its failure to meet these additional 
requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter 
beginning after the close of the first regular session of the State 
legislature that begins after the date of enactment of this Act. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-
year legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed to 
be a separate regular session of the State legislature.

payment shall be made to a State under this section for expenditures for 
medical assistance under the State plan consisting of a designated 
health service (as defined in subsection (h)(6) of section 1877) 
furnished to an individual on the basis of a referral that would result 
in the denial of payment for the service under title XVIII if such title 
provided for coverage of such service to the same extent and under the 
same terms and conditions as under the State plan, and subsections (f) 
and (g)(5) of such section shall apply to a provider of such a 
designated health service for which payment may be made under this title 
in the same manner as such subsections apply to a provider of such a 
service for which payment may be made under such title.''.

    a medicaid fraud and abuse control unit described in section 1903(q) 
    that effectively carries out the functions and requirements 
    described in such section, as determined in accordance with 
    standards established by the Secretary, unless the State 
    demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the effective 
    operation of such a unit in the State would not be cost-effective 
    because minimal fraud exists in connection with the provision of 
    covered services to eligible individuals under the State plan, and 
    that beneficiaries under the plan will be protected from abuse and 
    neglect in connection with the provision of medical assistance under 
    the plan without the existence of such a unit.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--Section 1902(a)(61) of the Social Security Act 
(as added by subsection (a)) shall take effect January 1, 1995, and the

             ``program for distribution of pediatric vaccines

    ``Sec. 1928. (a) Establishment of Program.--
        ``(1) In general.--In order to meet the requirement of section 
    1902(a)(62), each State shall establish a pediatric vaccine 
    distribution program (which may be administered by the State 
    department of health), consistent with the requirements of this 
    section, under which--
            ``(A) each vaccine-eligible child (as defined in subsection 
        (b)), in receiving an immunization with a qualified pediatric 
        vaccine (as defined in subsection (h)(8)) from a program-
        registered provider (as defined in subsection (c)) on or after 
        October 1, 1994, is entitled to receive the immunization without 
        charge for the cost of such vaccine; and
            ``(B)(i) each program-registered provider who administers 
        such a pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child on or after 
        such date is entitled to receive such vaccine under the program 
        without charge either for the vaccine or its delivery to the 
        provider, and (ii) no vaccine is distributed under the program 
        to a provider unless the provider is a program-registered 
        provider.
        ``(2) Delivery of sufficient quantities of pediatric vaccines to 
    immunize federally vaccine-eligible children.--
            ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall provide under 
        subsection (d) for the purchase and delivery on behalf of each 
        State meeting the requirement of section 1902(a)(62) (or, with 
        respect to vaccines administered by an Indian tribe or tribal 
        organization to Indian children, directly to the tribe or 
        organization), without charge to the State, of such quantities 
        of qualified pediatric vaccines as may be necessary for the 
        administration of such vaccines to all federally vaccine-
        eligible children in the State on or after October 1, 1994. This 
        paragraph constitutes budget authority in advance of 
        appropriations Acts, and represents the obligation of the 
        Federal Government to provide for the purchase and delivery to 
        States of the vaccines (or payment under subparagraph (C)) in 
        accordance with this paragraph.
            ``(B) Special rules where vaccine is unavailable.--To the 
        extent that a sufficient quantity of a vaccine is not available 
        for purchase or delivery under subsection (d), the Secretary 
        shall provide for the purchase and delivery of the available 
        vaccine in accordance with priorities established by the 
        Secretary, with priority given to federally vaccine-eligible 
        children unless the Secretary finds there are other public 
        health considerations.
            ``(C) Special rules where state is a manufacturer.--
                ``(i) Payments in lieu of vaccines.--In the case of a 
            State that manufactures a pediatric vaccine the Secretary, 
            instead of providing the vaccine on behalf of a State under 
            subparagraph (A), shall provide to the State an amount equal 
            to the value of the quantity of such vaccine that otherwise 
            would have been delivered on behalf of the State under such 
            subparagraph, but only if the State agrees that such 
            payments will only be used for purposes relating to 
            pediatric immunizations.
                ``(ii) Determination of value.--In determining the 
            amount to pay a State under clause (i) with respect to a 
            pediatric vaccine, the value of the quantity of vaccine 
            shall be determined on the basis of the price in effect for 
            the qualified pediatric vaccine under contracts under 
            subsection (d). If more than 1 such contract is in effect, 
            the Secretary shall determine such value on the basis of the 
            average of the prices under the contracts, after weighting 
            each such price in relation to the quantity of vaccine under 
            the contract involved.
    ``(b) Vaccine-Eligible Children.--For purposes of this section:
        ``(1) In general.--The term `vaccine-eligible child' means a 
    child who is a federally vaccine-eligible child (as defined in 
    paragraph (2)) or a State vaccine-eligible child (as defined in 
    paragraph (3)).
        ``(2) Federally vaccine-eligible child.--
            ``(A) In general.--The term `federally vaccine-eligible 
        child' means any of the following children:

            pediatric vaccine by a federally-qualified health center (as 
            defined in section 1905(l)(2)(B)) or a rural health clinic 
            (as defined in section 1905(l)(1)), and (II) is not insured 
            with respect to the vaccine.
                ``(iv) A child who is an Indian (as defined in 
            subsection (h)(3)).
            ``(B) Definitions.--In subparagraph (A):
                ``(i) The term `medicaid-eligible' means, with respect 
            to a child, a child who is entitled to medical assistance 
            under a state plan approved under this title.
                ``(ii) The term `insured' means, with respect to a 
            child--

                    ``(I) for purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), that the 
                child is enrolled under, and entitled to benefits under, 
                a health insurance policy or plan, including a group 
                health plan, a prepaid health plan, or an employee 
                welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement 
                Income Security Act of 1974; and
                    ``(II) for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii)(II) 
                with respect to a pediatric vaccine, that the child is 
                entitled to benefits under such a health insurance 
                policy or plan, but such benefits are not available with 
                respect to the cost of the pediatric vaccine.

        ``(3) State vaccine-eligible child.--The term `State vaccine-
    eligible child' means, with respect to a State and a qualified 
    pediatric vaccine, a child who is within a class of children for 
    which the State is purchasing the vaccine pursuant to subsection 
    (d)(4)(B).
    ``(c) Program-Registered Providers.--
        ``(1) Defined.--In this section, except as otherwise provided, 
    the term `program-registered provider' means, with respect to a 
    State, any health care provider that--
            ``(A) is licensed or otherwise authorized for administration 
        of pediatric vaccines under the law of the State in which the 
        administration occurs (subject to section 333(e) of the Public 
        Health Service Act), without regard to whether or not the 
        provider participates in the plan under this title;
            ``(B) submits to the State an executed provider agreement 
        described in paragraph (2); and
            ``(C) has not been found, by the Secretary or the State, to 
        have violated such agreement or other applicable requirements 
        established by the Secretary or the State consistent with this 
        section.
        ``(2) Provider agreement.--A provider agreement for a provider 
    under this paragraph is an agreement (in such form and manner as the 
    Secretary may require) that the provider agrees as follows:
            ``(A)(i) Before administering a qualified pediatric vaccine 
        to a child, the provider will ask a parent of the child such 
        questions as are necessary to determine whether the child is a 
        vaccine-eligible child, but the provider need not independently 
        verify the answers to such questions.
            ``(ii) The provider will, for a period of time specified by 
        the Secretary, maintain records of responses made to the 
        questions.
            ``(iii) The provider will, upon request, make such records 
        available to the State and to the Secretary, subject to section 
        1902(a)(7).
            ``(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the provider will comply 
        with the schedule, regarding the appropriate periodicity, 
        dosage, and contraindications applicable to pediatric vaccines, 
        that is established and periodically reviewed and, as 
        appropriate, revised by the advisory committee referred to in 
        subsection (e), except in such cases as, in the provider's 
        medical judgment subject to accepted medical practice, such 
        compliance is medically inappropriate.
            ``(ii) The provider will provide pediatric vaccines in 
        compliance with applicable State law, including any such law 
        relating to any religious or other exemption.
            ``(C)(i) In administering a qualified pediatric vaccine to a 
        vaccine-eligible child, the provider will not impose a charge 
        for the cost of the vaccine. A program-registered provider is 
        not required under this section to administer such a vaccine to 
        each child for whom an immunization with the vaccine is sought 
        from the provider.
            ``(ii) The provider may impose a fee for the administration 
        of a qualified pediatric vaccine so long as the fee in the case 
        of a federally vaccine-eligible child does not exceed the costs 
        of such administration (as determined by the Secretary based on 
        actual regional costs for such administration).
            ``(iii) The provider will not deny administration of a 
        qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child due to 
        the inability of the child's parent to pay an administration 
        fee.
        ``(3) Encouraging involvement of providers.--Each program under 
    this section shall provide, in accordance with criteria established 
    by the Secretary--
            ``(A) for encouraging the following to become program-
        registered providers: private health care providers, the Indian 
        Health Service, health care providers that receive funds under 
        title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and health 
        programs or facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal 
        organizations; and
            ``(B) for identifying, with respect to any population of 
        vaccine-eligible children a substantial portion of whose parents 
        have a limited ability to speak the English language, those 
        program-registered providers who are able to communicate with 
        the population involved in the language and cultural context 
        that is most appropriate.
        ``(4) State requirements.--Except as the Secretary may permit in 
    order to prevent fraud and abuse and for related purposes, a State 
    may not impose additional qualifications or conditions, in addition 
    to the requirements of paragraph (1), in order that a provider 
    qualify as a program-registered provider under this section. This 
    subsection does not limit the exercise of State authority under 
    section 1915(b).
    ``(d) Negotiation of Contracts with Manufacturers.--
        ``(1) In general.--For the purpose of meeting obligations under 
    this section, the Secretary shall negotiate and enter into contracts 
    with manufacturers of pediatric vaccines consistent with the 
    requirements of this subsection and, to the maximum extent 
    practicable, consolidate such contracting with any other contracting 
    activities conducted by the Secretary to purchase vaccines. The 
    Secretary may enter into such contracts under which the Federal 
    Government is obligated to make outlays, the budget authority for 
    which is not provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, for the 
    purchase and delivery of pediatric vaccines under subsection 
    (a)(2)(A).
        ``(2) Authority to decline contracts.--The Secretary may decline 
    to enter into such contracts and may modify or extend such 
    contracts.
        ``(3) Contract price.--
            ``(A) In general.--The Secretary, in negotiating the prices 
        at which pediatric vaccines will be purchased and delivered from 
        a manufacturer under this subsection, shall take into account 
        quantities of vaccines to be purchased by States under the 
        option under paragraph (4)(B).
            ``(B) Negotiation of discounted price for current 
        vaccines.--With respect to contracts entered into under this 
        subsection for a pediatric vaccine for which the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention has a contract in effect under 
        section 317(j)(1) of the Public Health Service Act as of May 1, 
        1993, no price for the purchase of such vaccine for vaccine-
        eligible children shall be agreed to by the Secretary under this 
        subsection if the price per dose of such vaccine (including 
        delivery costs and any applicable excise tax established under 
        section 4131 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) exceeds the 
        price per dose for the vaccine in effect under such a contract

        tribes and tribal organizations) of quantities of pediatric 
        vaccines for federally vaccine-eligible children; and
            ``(B) each State, at the option of the State, shall be 
        permitted to obtain additional quantities of pediatric vaccines 
        (subject to amounts specified to the Secretary by the State in 
        advance of negotiations) through purchasing the vaccines from 
        the manufacturers at the applicable price negotiated by the 
        Secretary consistent with paragraph (3), if (i) the State agrees 
        that the vaccines will be used to provide immunizations only for 
        children who are not federally vaccine-eligible children and 
        (ii) the State provides to the Secretary such information (at a 
        time and manner specified by the Secretary, including in advance

        to be necessary, to provide for quantities of pediatric vaccines 
        for the State to purchase pursuant to this subsection and to 
        determine annually the percentage of the vaccine market that is 
        purchased pursuant to this section and this subparagraph.

    enter into a contract referred to in paragraph (1) only if the 
    manufacturer involved agrees to submit to the Secretary such reports 
    as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to assure compliance 
    with the contract and if, with respect to a State program under this 
    section that does not provide for the direct delivery of qualified 
    pediatric vaccines, the manufacturer involved agrees that the 
    manufacturer will provide for the delivery of the vaccines on behalf 
    of the State in accordance with such program and will not impose any 
    charges for the costs of such delivery (except to the extent such 
    costs are provided for in the price established under paragraph

    will be maintained to meet unanticipated needs for the vaccines. For 
    purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall negotiate 
    for a 6-month supply of vaccines in addition to the quantity that 
    the Secretary otherwise would provide for in such negotiations. In 
    carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider the 
    potential for outbreaks of the diseases with respect to which the 
    vaccines have been developed.
        ``(7) Multiple suppliers.--In the case of the pediatric vaccine 
    involved, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, enter into a contract 
    referred to in paragraph (1) with each manufacturer of the vaccine 
    that meets the terms and conditions of the Secretary for an award of 
    such a contract (including terms and conditions regarding safety and 
    quality). With respect to multiple contracts entered into pursuant 
    to this paragraph, the Secretary may have in effect different prices 
    under each of such contracts and, with respect to a purchase by 
    States pursuant to paragraph (4)(B), the Secretary shall determine 
    which of such contracts will be applicable to the purchase.
    ``(e) Use of Pediatric Vaccines List.--The Secretary shall use, for 
the purpose of the purchase, delivery, and administration of pediatric 
vaccines under this section, the list established (and periodically 
reviewed and as appropriate revised) by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (an advisory committee established by the 
Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention).

case of a State that had in effect as of May 1, 1993, a law that 
requires some or all health insurance policies or plans to provide some 
coverage with respect to a pediatric vaccine, a State program under this 
section does not comply with the requirements of this section unless the

repealed such law in a manner that reduces the amount of coverage so 
required.
    ``(g) Termination.--This section, and the requirement of section
