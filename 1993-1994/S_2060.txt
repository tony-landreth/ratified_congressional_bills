            balance due on the debenture as of the date of the 
            prepayment (plus accrued interest at the coupon rate on the 
            debenture) and the amount of the repurchase premium 
            described in subparagraph (B); and
                ``(ii) the Administration shall pay to the Federal 
            Financing Bank the difference between the repurchase 
            premium paid by the borrower under this subsection and the
