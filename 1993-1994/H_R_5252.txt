            discharged or transferred to a hospital within 72 hours of 
            admission to the facility; or

            surgical procedures specified by the Secretary under 
            section 1833(i)(1)(A)), unless the attending physician 
            certifies that the risk associated with transferring the 
            patient to a hospital for such services outweighs the 
            benefits of transferring the patient to a hospital for such 
            services.''.

        ``(4) Limitation on average length of inpatient stays.--The 
    Secretary may terminate a designation of a rural primary care 
    hospital under paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds that the 
    average length of stay for inpatients at the facility during the 
    previous year in which the designation was in effect exceeded 72 
    hours. In determining the compliance of a facility with the 
    requirement of the previous sentence, there shall not be taken into 
    account periods of stay of inpatients in excess of 72 hours to the 
    extent such periods exceed 72 hours because transfer to a hospital 
    is precluded because of inclement weather or other emergency 
    conditions.''.
        (3) Conforming amendment.--Section 1814(a)(8) (42 U.S.C. 
    1395f(a)(8)) is amended by striking ``such services'' and all that

    to Congress on--
            (A) the application of the requirements under section 
        1820(f) of the Social Security Act (as amended by this 
        subsection) that rural primary care hospitals provide inpatient 
        care only to those individuals whose attending physicians 
        certify may reasonably be expected to be discharged within 72 
        hours after admission and maintain an average length of 
        inpatient stay during a year that does not exceed 72 hours; and
            (B) the extent to which such requirements have resulted in 
        such hospitals providing inpatient care beyond their 
        capabilities or have limited the ability of such hospitals to 
        provide needed services.

            be reduced to the extent the individual has an outstanding 
            balance owed by the individual to the physician.
            ``(B) Sanctions.--If a physician, supplier, or other 
        person--

    economically self-sufficient and that the life prospects of 
    children are improved, and to underscore the responsibility of 
    parents to support their children;
        (3) the Federal Government should help welfare recipients as 
    well as individuals at risk of welfare receipt to improve their 
    education and job skills, to obtain child care and other necessary 
    support services, and to take such other steps as may be necessary 
    to assist them to become financially independent; and
        (4) it is the purpose of this section to provide the public 
    with generally accepted measures of welfare receipt so that it can 
    track such receipt over time and determine whether progress is
