confirming a plan of reorganization under chapter 11 may issue, in 
connection with such order, an injunction in accordance with this 
subsection to supplement the injunctive effect of a discharge under 
this section.
    ``(B) An injunction may be issued under subparagraph (A) to enjoin 
entities from taking legal action for the purpose of directly or 
indirectly collecting, recovering, or receiving payment or recovery 
with respect to any claim or demand that, under a plan of 
reorganization, is to be paid in whole or in part by a trust described 
in paragraph (2)(B)(i), except such legal actions as are expressly 
allowed by the injunction, the confirmation order, or the plan of 
reorganization.
    ``(2)(A) Subject to subsection (h), if the requirements of 
subparagraph (B) are met at the time an injunction described in 
paragraph (1) is entered, then after entry of such injunction, any 
proceeding that involves the validity, application, construction, or 
modification of such injunction, or of this subsection with respect to 
such injunction, may be commenced only in the district court in which 
such injunction was entered, and such court shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction over any such proceeding without regard to the amount in 
controversy.
    ``(B) The requirements of this subparagraph are that--
        ``(i) the injunction is to be implemented in connection with a 
    trust that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization--
            ``(I) is to assume the liabilities of a debtor which at the 
        time of entry of the order for relief has been named as a 
        defendant in personal injury, wrongful death, or property-

        payments, including dividends;

        future demands for payment arising out of the same or similar 
        conduct or events that gave rise to the claims that are 
        addressed by the injunction;

        future demands cannot be determined;

        prescribed by such plan is likely to threaten the plan's 
        purpose to deal equitably with claims and future demands;

        such plan--

            issued under paragraph (1)(A), including any provisions

identifiable from the terms of such injunction (by name or as part of 
an identifiable group) and is alleged to be directly or indirectly 
liable for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on the debtor to 
the extent such alleged liability of such third party arises by reason
