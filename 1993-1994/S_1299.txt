            TITLE I_MULTIFAMILY PROPERTY DISPOSITION REFORM

SEC. 101. MULTIFAMILY PROPERTY DISPOSITION.

    (a) Findings._The Congress finds that_
        (1) the portfolio of multifamily housing project mortgages 
    insured by the FHA is severely troubled and at risk of default, 
    requiring the Secretary to increase loss reserves from 
    $5,500,000,000 in 1991 to $11,900,000,000 in 1992 to cover 
    estimated future losses;
        (2) the inventory of multifamily housing projects owned by the 
    Secretary has more than quadrupled since 1989, and, by the end of 
    1994, may exceed 69,000 units;
        (3) the cost to the Federal Government of owning and 
    maintaining multifamily housing projects escalated to $288,000,000 
    in fiscal year 1993;
        (4) the inventory of multifamily housing projects subject to 
    mortgages held by the Secretary has increased dramatically, to more 
    than 2,400 mortgages, and approximately half of these mortgages, 
    with approximately 219,000 units, are delinquent;
        (5) the inventory of insured and formerly insured multifamily 
    housing projects is deteriorating, potentially endangering tenants 
    and neighborhoods; and
        (6) the current statutory framework governing the disposition 
    of multifamily housing projects effectively impedes the 
    Government's ability to dispose of properties, protect tenants, and 
    ensure that projects are maintained over time.
    (b) Management and Disposition of Multifamily Housing Projects._
Section 203 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978 
(12 U.S.C. 1701z-11) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 203. MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSITION OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING PROJECTS.

    ``(a) Goals._The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall 
manage or dispose of multifamily housing projects that are owned by the 
Secretary or that are subject to a mortgage held by the Secretary in a 
manner that_
        ``(1) is consistent with the National Housing Act and this 
    section;
        ``(2) will protect the financial interests of the Federal 
    Government; and
        ``(3) will, in the least costly fashion among reasonable 
    available alternatives, address the goals of_
            ``(A) preserving certain housing so that it can remain 
        available to and affordable by low-income persons;
            ``(B) preserving and revitalizing residential 
        neighborhoods;
            ``(C) maintaining existing housing stock in a decent, safe, 
        and sanitary condition;
            ``(D) minimizing the involuntary displacement of tenants;
            ``(E) maintaining housing for the purpose of providing 
        rental housing, cooperative housing, and homeownership 
        opportunities for low-income persons;
            ``(F) minimizing the need to demolish multifamily housing 
        projects;
            ``(G) supporting fair housing strategies; and
            ``(H) disposing of such projects in a manner consistent 
        with local housing market conditions.
In determining the manner in which a project is to be managed or 
disposed of, the Secretary may balance competing goals relating to 
individual projects in a manner that will further the purposes of this 
section.

    provided under the National Housing Act, the Secretary may reduce 
    the selling price of the project. Such reduced sales price shall be

    units in the project that can be supported by the market, the 
    amount of rental assistance available for the project under section 
    8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, the occupancy profile

        of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
        ``(4) Up-front grants._If the Secretary determines that action 
    under this paragraph is more cost-effective than establishing rents

    authority provided for contracts issued under this section for 
    project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States 
    Housing Act of 1937 to (in addition to providing project-based

            multifamily housing projects that are disposed of by the

            or area-wide governing body determine that such use will 
            further fair housing, community development, or 
            neighborhood revitalization goals.

    (or for which the Secretary is mortgagee in possession), the 
    Secretary shall identify tenants who will be displaced, and shall 
    notify all such tenants of their pending displacement and of any 
    relocation assistance that may be available. In the case of a 
    multifamily housing project that is subject to a mortgage held by 
    the Secretary, the Secretary shall require the owner of the project 
    to carry out the requirements of this paragraph, if the Secretary 
    has authorized the demolition of, repairs to, or conversion in the

    loan or mortgage held by the Secretary (including any loan or 
    mortgage owned by the Government National Mortgage Association) on 
    any subsidized project or formerly subsidized project, unless such 
    sale is made as part of a transaction that will ensure that such 
    project will continue to operate at least until the maturity date 
    of such loan or mortgage, in a manner that will provide rental 
    housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future 
    tenants as the terms required by the program under which the loan 
    or mortgage was made or insured prior to the assignment of the loan 
    or mortgage on such project to the Secretary.
        ``(2) Sale of certain projects._The Secretary may not approve 
    the sale of any subsidized project_
            ``(A) that is subject to a mortgage held by the Secretary,

        additional subsidy funds by the Secretary or a recasting of the 
        mortgage,

    that the project will continue to operate, at least until the 
    maturity date of the loan or mortgage, in a manner that will 
    provide rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to 
    existing and future tenants as the terms required by the program

    proposed sale of the project.

    Notwithstanding any provision of law that requires competitive 
    sales or bidding, the Secretary may carry out negotiated sales of 
    mortgages held by the Secretary, without the competitive selection 
    of purchasers or intermediaries, to units of general local 
    government or State agencies, or groups of investors that include 
    at least one such unit of general local government or State agency, 
    if the negotiations are conducted with such agencies, except that_
            ``(A) the terms of any such sale shall include the 
        agreement of the purchasing agency or unit of local government 
        or State agency to act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial 
        interest in such mortgages, in a manner consistent with 
        maintaining the projects that are subject to such mortgages for 
        occupancy by the general tenant group intended to be served by 
        the applicable mortgage insurance program, including, to the 
        extent the Secretary determines appropriate, authorizing such 
        unit of local government or State agency to enforce the 
        provisions of any regulatory agreement or other program 
        requirements applicable to the related projects; and

        intention that the projects financed will be retained for use 
        under the applicable mortgage insurance program for the life of 
        the initial mortgage insurance contract.
        ``(4) Sale of mortgages covering unsubsidized projects._
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may sell
