        S.J.Res. 179

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
 To designate the week of June 12 through 19, 1994, as ``National Men's

                             Health Week''.

Whereas despite the advances in medical technology and research, men 
  continue to live an average of 7 years less than women;
Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate cancer is 1 in 
  11;
Whereas the number of men contracting prostate cancer will reach over 
  120,000 in 1993, with an expected one-third of the cases to die from 
  the disease;
Whereas testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in men aged 
  15-34, and when detected early, has an 87 percent survival rate;
Whereas the number of men contracting lung disease will reach over 
  100,000 in 1993, with an expected 85 percent of the cases to die from 
  the disease;
Whereas the number of cases of colon cancer among men will reach over 
  80,000 in 1993; with nearly one-third of the cases to die from the 
  disease;
Whereas the death rate for prostate cancer has grown at almost twice 
  the death rate of breast cancer in the last five years;
Whereas African-American men in the United States have the highest 
  incidence in the world of cancer of the prostate;
Whereas men are seven times as likely as women to be arrested for drunk 
  driving and three times as likely to be alcoholics;
Whereas women visit the doctor 150 percent as often as men, enabling 
  them to detect health problems in their early stages;
Whereas significant numbers of male related health problems such as 
  prostate cancer, testicular cancer, infertility, and colon cancer, 
  could be detected and treated if men's awareness of these problems 
  was more pervasive;
Whereas educating both the public and health care providers about the 
  importance of early detection of male health problems will result in 
  reducing rates of mortality for these diseases;
Whereas appropriate use of tests such as Prostate Specific Antigen 
  (PSA) exams, blood pressure screens, cholesterol screens, etc., in 
  conjunction with clinical examination and self-testing for problems 
  such as testicular cancer can result in the detection of many of 
  these problems in their early stages and increases in the survival 
  rates to nearly 100 percent;
Whereas many men are reluctant to visit their health center or 
  physician for regular screening examinations of male related problems 
  for a variety of reasons including fear, lack of information, and 
  cost factors; and
Whereas men who are educated about the value that preventive health can 
  play in prolonging their lifespan and their role as a productive 
  family member will be more likely to participate in health 
  screenings: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That June 12 through 19, 1994, 
is designated as National Men's Health Week, and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the 
people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
programs and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.
