        S.J.Res. 122
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
    Designating December 1993 as ``National Drunk and Drugged Driving

                           Prevention Month''.

Whereas impaired driving is the most frequently committed violent crime 
  in the United States;
Whereas last year 45 percent of those who died on our Nation's highways 
  were the result of alcohol involved crashes;
Whereas last year nearly eighteen thousand people were killed and one 
  million two hundred thousand were injured in crashes involving 
  alcohol;
Whereas impaired driving continues to cost society some $46,000,000,000 
  each year in direct costs;
Whereas medical costs associated with impaired driving run approximately 
  $5,500,000,000 a year;
Whereas injury and property damage resulting from impaired driving cause 
  physical, emotional, and economic hardship for hundreds of thousands 
  of adults and young people;
Whereas the ongoing work of citizen activists groups such as Mothers 
  Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Students Against Driving Drunk (SADD), 
  Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), and the National Commission Against 
  Drunk Driving continue to promote good prevention efforts which have 
  contributed to a 30 percent reduction in alcohol-related traffic 
  deaths over the past decade;
Whereas a decade of intense public education effort has proved that 
  alcohol-related highway crashes are not accidents and can be 
  prevented;
Whereas comprehensive community-based strategies to further reduce and 
  prevent impaired driving tragedies are known to be effective;
Whereas an increased public awareness of the gravity of the problem of 
  drunk and drugged driving may help to sustain efforts to develop 
  comprehensive solutions at the State and local levels;
Whereas more than seventy public and private sector organizations have 
  joined together to carry out a nationwide public information, 
  education, and enforcement campaign during the December holiday 
  season;
Whereas the Secretary of Transportation has set a goal by the year 1997 
  to reduce alcohol-related fatalities to 43 percent and MADD has set a 
  goal by the year 2000 to reduce alcohol-related traffic fatalities to 
  40 percent;
Whereas the Secretary of Health and Human Services has set a goal by the 
  year 2000 for all fifty States to prohibit any allowable blood-alcohol 
  concentration tolerance level for drivers younger than age twenty-one; 
  and
Whereas December is a month of many holidays and celebrations, with more 
  drivers on the roads and an increased number of social functions, is a 
  particularly appropriate time to focus national attention on this 
  critical problem; Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the month of December, 
1993 is designated as ``National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention 
Month'', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe 
that month with appropriate activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
