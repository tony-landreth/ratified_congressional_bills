  movement, is revered worldwide for the contributions he has made to 
  education and sharing;
Whereas the 2,000 educational, social, and rehabilitative institutions 
  administered by Lubavitch advance these ideals for the millions of 
  people whom they serve each year;
Whereas Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson has interpreted, in the 
  miraculous events of our times, the increasing vitality of these 
  ideals for the furtherance of human understanding and betterment;
Whereas the extraordinary life and work of Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
  Schneerson have long been acknowledged by the Congress through the 
  enactment of Joint Resolutions designating his birthday in each of the 
  last 15 years as ``Education Day, U.S.A.'';
Whereas the Lubavicher Rebbe's 91st birthday falls on April 2, 1993;
Whereas in tribute to this esteemed spiritual leader, the Lubavicher 
  Rebbe's birthday will be designated as ``Education and Sharing Day, 
  U.S.A.''; and
Whereas such designation will signal a renewal of our Nation's 
  commitment to greater acts of charity, to an enriched emphasis on 
  education, and to the furtherance of ethical teachings and values in 
  the affairs of government and in the lives of our citizens: Now, 
  therefore, be it
