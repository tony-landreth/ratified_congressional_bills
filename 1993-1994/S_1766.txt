                                 An Act

  
 
  To amend the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 
1990 to cover seedless and not seeded limes, to increase the exemption 
level, to delay the initial referendum date, and to alter the 
composition of the Lime Board, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lime Research, Promotion, and 
Consumer Information Improvement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) The Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act 
    of 1990 was enacted on November 28, 1990, for the purpose of 
    establishing an orderly procedure for the development and financing 
    of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and 
    consumer information to strengthen the domestic and foreign markets 
    for limes.
        (2) The lime research, promotion, and consumer information order 
    required by such Act became effective on January 27, 1992.
        (3) Although the intent of such Act was to cover seedless limes, 
    the definition of the term ``lime'' in section 1953(6) of such Act 
    applies to seeded limes. Therefore, the Act and the order need to be 
    revised before a research, promotion, and consumer information 
    program on seedless limes can go into effect.
        (4) Since the enactment of the Lime Research, Promotion, and 
    Consumer Information Act of 1990, the United States production of 
    fresh market limes has plummeted and the volume of imports has risen 
    dramatically. The drop in United States production is primarily due 
    to damage to lime orchards in the State of Florida by Hurricane 
    Andrew in August 1992. United States production is not expected to 
    reach pre-Hurricane Andrew levels for possibly two to three years 
    because a majority of the United States production of limes is in 
    Florida.
    (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is--
        (1) to revise the definition of the term ``lime'' in order to 
    cover seedless and not seeded limes;
        (2) to increase the exemption level;
        (3) to delay the initial referendum date; and
        (4) to alter the composition of the Lime Board.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF LIME.

    Section 1953(6) of the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer 
Information Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6202(6)) is amended by striking 
``citrus aurantifolia'' and inserting ``citrus latifolia''.

SEC. 4. REQUIRED TERMS IN ORDERS.

    Information Improvement Act.''; and

    paragraph:

        producer members and 1 importer member from the district east of 
        the Mississippi River and 1 producer member and 2 importer 
        members from the district west of the Mississippi River.''.
    (b) Terms of Members.--Subsection (b)(4) of such section is 
amended--
        (1) by striking ``Members'' and all that follows through 
    ``appointed--'' and inserting ``The initial members of the Board 
    appointed under the amended order shall serve a term of 30 months. 
    Subsequent appointments to the Board shall be for a term of 3 years, 
    except that--'';
        (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``3'' and inserting ``2'';
        (3) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``4'' and inserting ``2''; 
    and
