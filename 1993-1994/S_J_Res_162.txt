        S.J.Res. 162

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating March 25, 1994, as ``Greek Independence Day: A National 
Day of


             Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''.

Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which 
  the supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew heavily upon the 
  political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the 
  representative democracy of the United States;
Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond both between the 
  United States and Greece and between their peoples;
Whereas March 25, 1994, marks the 173rd anniversary of the beginning of 
  the revolution that freed Greek people from the Ottoman Empire and 
  enabled the reestablishment of democracy in Greece; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate that anniversary with 
  the Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which 
  the United States and Greece were born: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1994, is 
designated as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of 
Greek and American Democracy'', and the President is authorized and 
requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United 
States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                                                President of the Senate.
