  To authorize the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration

  Fond du Lac, Wisconsin;
Whereas in 1992 the International Aerobatic Club had 5,342 members 
  throughout the world, representatives of which gathered in Fond du Lac 
  to compete in the 23d Annual Aerobatic Championships during the period 
  of August 9-14, 1992;
Whereas in 1992 the Experimental Aircraft Association and the Board of 
  Directors of the International Aerobatic Club named Fond du Lac as the 
  ``World Capital of Aerobatics'';
Whereas participants and spectators drawn to the aerobatic championships 
  in Fond du Lac stimulate the economic well-being of the community and 
  provide a spectator event of international significance; and
Whereas Congress declares that the county of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, is 
  the ``World Capital of Aerobatics'': Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration may conduct appropriate programs and 
activities at the Fond du Lac County Airport to acknowledge the status 
of the county of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, as the ``World Capital of 
Aerobatics'', and that the airport may display signs notifying the 
public of such status.
