                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating August 2, 1994, as ``National Neighborhood Crime Watch 
Day''.

Whereas neighborhood crime is of continuing concern to the American 
  people;
Whereas the fight against neighborhood crime requires people to work 
  together in cooperation with law enforcement officials;
Whereas neighborhood crime watch organizations are effective at 
  promoting awareness about, and the participation of volunteers in, 
  crime prevention activities at the local level;
Whereas neighborhood crime watch groups can contribute to the Nation's 
  war on drugs by helping to prevent their communities from becoming 
  markets for drug dealers; and
Whereas citizens across America will soon take part in a ``National 
  Night Out'', a unique crime prevention event which will demonstrate 
  the importance and effectiveness of community participation in crime 
  prevention efforts by having people spend the period from 9 to 10 
  o'clock postmeridian on August 2, 1994, with their neighbors in front 
  of their homes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That August 2, 1994, is 
designated as ``National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day'', and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe such day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.
