        S.J.Res. 55
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate the periods commencing on November 28, 1993, and ending 
on December 4, 1993, and commencing on November 27, 1994, and ending on 
December 3, 1994, as ``National Home Care Week''.

Whereas organized home care services for the elderly and disabled have 
  existed in the United States since the last quarter of the 18th 
  century;
Whereas home care is an effective and economical alternative to 
  unnecessary institutionalization;
Whereas caring for the ill and disabled in their homes places an 
  emphasis on the dignity and independence of the individual receiving 
  these services;
Whereas since the enactment of the medicare home care program, which 
  provides coverage for skilled nursing services, physical therapy, 
  speech therapy, social services, occupational therapy, and home health 
  aide services, the number of home care agencies in the United States 
  providing these services has increased from fewer than 1,275 to more 
  than 12,000; and
Whereas many private and charitable organizations provide these and 
  similar services to millions of individuals each year, preventing, 
  postponing, and limiting the need for them to become institutionalized 
  to receive these services: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the periods commencing on 
November 28, 1993, and ending on December 4, 1993, and commencing on 
November 27, 1994, and ending on December 3, 1994, are each designated 
as ``National Home Care Week'', and the President is authorized and 
requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United 
States to observe such weeks with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
