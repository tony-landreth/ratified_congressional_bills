  To designate March 20 through March 26, 1994, as ``Small Family Farm 
Week''.

Whereas the small family farmer contributes enormously to the 
  agricultural productivity of the United States;
Whereas the plight of the small family farmer has been in jeopardy in 
  recent times;
Whereas many small family farms continue to operate in the face of 
  financial and credit difficulties;
Whereas the size and crop makeup of family farms varies from region to 
  region in the United States; and
Whereas the small family farm represents the historical foundation of 
  American agriculture: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week of March 20 
through March 26, 1994, is designated as ``Small Family Farm Week'', 
and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation 
calling on the people of the United States to observe the week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                                               President of the Senate.
