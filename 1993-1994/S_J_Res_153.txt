        S.J.Res. 153

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate the week beginning on November 20, 1994 and ending on 
November 26, 1994, as ``National Family Caregivers Week''.

Whereas the number of Americans who are age 65 or older is growing 
  dramatically, with an unprecedented increase in the number of frail 
  elderly age 85 or older;
Whereas approximately 5,200,000 older persons have disabilities that 
  leave them in need of help with their daily tasks, including food 
  preparation, dressing, and bathing;
Whereas families provide help to older persons with such tasks, in 
  addition to providing between 80 and 90 percent of the medical care, 
  household maintenance, transportation, and shopping needed by older 
  persons;
Whereas 80 percent of disabled elderly persons receive care from their 
  family members, most of whom are their wives, daughters, and 
  daughters-in-law, who often must sacrifice employment opportunities 
  to provide such care;
Whereas family caregivers are often physically and emotionally 
  exhausted from the amount of time and stress involved in caregiving 
  activities, and therefore need information about available community 
  resources for respite care and other support services;
Whereas the contributions of family caregivers help maintain strong 
  family ties and assure support among generations; and
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of and support for 
  the care that family caregivers are providing older persons: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning on 
November 20, 1994 and ending on November 26, 1994, is designated 
``National Family Caregivers Week'', and the President is authorized 
and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the 
United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
