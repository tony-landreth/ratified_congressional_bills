Whereas emergency medical services is a vital public service;
Whereas access to quality emergency care dramatically improves the

  began 25 years ago with the founding of the American College of 
  Emergency Physicians in 1968;
Whereas the members of emergency medical services teams are ready to 
  provide lifesaving care to those in need 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
  week;
Whereas emergency medical services teams consist of emergency 
  physicians, emergency nurses, emergency medical technicians, 
  paramedics, firefighters, educators, administrators, and others;
Whereas approximately \2/3\ of all emergency medical services providers 
  are volunteers;
Whereas the members of emergency medical services teams, whether career 
  or volunteer, engage in thousands of hours of specialized training and 
  continuing education to enhance their lifesaving skills;
Whereas Americans benefit daily from the knowledge and skills of these 
  highly trained individuals;
Whereas it is appropriate to recognize the value and the accomplishments 
  of emergency medical services providers by designating Emergency 
  Medical Services Week; and
Whereas the designation of Emergency Medical Services Week will serve to 
  educate all Americans about injury prevention and how to respond to a 
  medical emergency: Now, therefore, be it

States of America in Congress assembled, That the weeks beginning May
