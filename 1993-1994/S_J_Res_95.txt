        S.J.Res. 95
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
To designate October 1993 as ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''.

Whereas breast cancer will strike an estimated 182,000 women and 1,000 
  men in the United States in 1993;
Whereas the risk of developing breast cancer increases as a woman grows 
  older;
Whereas breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in 
  women, and will kill an estimated 46,000 women and 300 men in 1993;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has risen 
  from 78 percent in the 1940's to over 90 percent today;
Whereas most breast cancers are detected by the woman herself;
Whereas educating both the public and health care providers about the 
  importance of early detection will result in reducing breast cancer 
  mortality;
Whereas appropriate use of screening mammography, in conjunction with 
  clinical examination and breast self-examination, can result in the 
  detection of many breast cancers early in their development and 
  increase the survival rate to nearly 100 percent;
Whereas data from controlled trials clearly demonstrate that deaths from 
  breast cancer are significantly reduced in women who have been 
  screened by mammography;
Whereas many women are reluctant to have screening mammograms for a 
  variety of reasons, such as the cost of testing, lack of information, 
  or fear;
Whereas access to screening mammography is directly related to 
  socioeconomic status;
Whereas increased awareness about the importance of screening 
  mammography will result in the procedure being regularly requested by 
  the patient and recommended by the health care provider; and
Whereas it is projected that more women will use this lifesaving test as 
  it becomes increasingly available and affordable: Now, therefore, be 
  it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That October
1993 is designated as ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month'' and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe the month with 
appropriate programs and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.
