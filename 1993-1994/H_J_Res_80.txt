  Designating May 30, 1993, through June 7, 1993, as a ``Time for the 
National

        Observance of the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the United States of America made 
  tremendous sacrifices during World War II to save the world from 
  tyranny and aggression;
Whereas the winds of freedom and democracy sweeping the globe today 
  spring from the principles for which over four hundred thousand 
  Americans gave their lives in World War II;
Whereas World War II and the events that led up to that war must be 
  understood in order that we may better understand our own times, and 
  more fully appreciate the reasons why eternal vigilance against any 
  form of tyranny is so important;
Whereas the World War II era, as reflected in its family life, industry, 
  and entertainment, was a unique period in American history, and 
  epitomized our Nation's philosophy of hard work, courage, and tenacity 
  in the face of adversity;
Whereas, between 1991 and 1995, over nine million American veterans of 
  World War II will be holding reunions and conferences and otherwise 
  commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of various events relating to 
  World War II; and
Whereas June 4, 1993, marks the Battle of Midway, and June 6, 1993, 
  marks the anniversary of D-Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That May 30,P
1993, through June 7, 1993, is designated as a ``Time for the National 
Observance of the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II'', and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on 
the people of the United States to observe that period with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
