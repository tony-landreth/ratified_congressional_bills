Whereas advancements in education, research, and public awareness are 
  continuing to improve the quality of life for people with Down 
  syndrome;
Whereas approximately 5,000 children are born with Down syndrome 
  annually in the United States;
Whereas as ignorance, prejudices, myths, and stereotypes regarding Down 
  syndrome can be overcome only through increased awareness and 
  education;
Whereas through the efforts of concerned physicians, teachers, parent 
  groups, and the National Down Syndrome Society, programs are being 
  established to educate the parents of individuals with Down syndrome, 
  to include people with Down syndrome in all school programs, to 
  provide vocational training for individuals with Down syndrome in 
  preparation for entering the work force, and to prepare young adults 
  with Down syndrome for independent living in the community;
Whereas the television medium has greatly augmented such efforts by 
  casting actors with Down syndrome and by offering programming that 
  demonstrates to hundreds of thousands of viewers in a positive and 
  educational manner the everyday, personal, and family effects of 
  living with Down syndrome;
Whereas advancements in research are improving health care and offering 
  a brighter outlook for individuals born with Down syndrome; and
Whereas the many people with Down syndrome who attend regular schools, 
  play on Little League teams, work in corporations and businesses both 
  large and small, and volunteer in the community demonstrate daily the 
  success that people with Down syndrome are able to achieve: Now, 
  therefore, be it
