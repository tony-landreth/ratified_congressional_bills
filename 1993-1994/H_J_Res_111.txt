                                 of the

                            Joint Resolution


 
 Designating October 21, 1993, as ``National Biomedical Research Day''.

Whereas the biomedical research community in the United States is 
  recognized as the world leader in discovering knowledge that promotes 
  the health and well-being of people throughout the world;
Whereas biomedical research offers the best hope for breakthroughs in 
  the detection and treatment of diseases in the future;
Whereas since 1900 biomedical research has helped increase the lifespan 
  of people in the United States by 25 years through the development of 
  vaccines, antibiotics, and anti-infective drugs;
Whereas biomedical research has contributed to the virtual elimination 
  of epidemic diseases such as cholera, smallpox, yellow fever, and 
  bubonic plague, and in the United States biomedical research has 
  helped to prevent such childhood killers as polio, diphtheria, 
  tetanus, pertussis, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome;
Whereas biomedical researchers are working diligently toward cures for 
  diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), 
  Alzheimer's disease, cancer, arthritis, diabetes, epilepsy, multiple 
  sclerosis, heart and lung diseases, mental illness, and countless 
  other diseases that afflict millions of people in the United States;
Whereas the Congress has consistently demonstrated a financial 
  commitment to maintaining the preeminence of the United States in 
  biomedical research through support of such agencies as the National 
  Institutes of Health, the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
  Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Veterans 
  Administration;
Whereas the products and byproducts of biomedical research contribute to 
  the health of the United States economy by reducing medical costs 
  through prevention of various diseases and by furthering the success 
  of the United States in international commerce and trade;
Whereas biomedical research has led to drugs and vaccines that safeguard 
  the animals we raise and the food we consume, protecting the health of 
  such animals as cattle, hogs, sheep, and chickens; and
Whereas biomedical research also has contributed to the health and well-
  being of animals through vaccines for parvovirus, infectious canine 
  hepatitis, rabies, distemper, anthrax, tetanus, and feline leukemia, 
  and has helped the prospects of endangered species by reducing disease 
  and promoting reproduction: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That October 21, 1993, is 
designated as ``National Biomedical Research Day'', and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people 
of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.
