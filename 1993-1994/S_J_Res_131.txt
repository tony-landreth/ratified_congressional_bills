        S.J.Res. 131
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
Designating the week beginning November 14, 1993, and the week beginning

        November 13, 1994, each as ``Geography Awareness Week''.

Whereas geography is the study of people and their planet, offering a 
  framework for understanding ourselves, our interdependence with other 
  peoples, our relationship to the Earth, and world events;
Whereas the United States has both worldwide involvements and influence 
  that demand an understanding of geography, different cultures, and 
  foreign languages;
Whereas a thorough knowledge of geography, different cultures, and 
  foreign languages is essential to maintain the Nation's stature in the 
  international community in matters of business, politics, the 
  environment, and global events;
Whereas a geographic perspective is needed to understand the 
  relationship between human activity and the condition of our planet in 
  this time of increasing environmental problems;
Whereas our Nation's Governors, in their National Education Goals, 
  explicitly identified geography along with English, mathematics, 
  science, and history as the 5 core subjects in which American students 
  should demonstrate competency;
Whereas world standards are being developed as benchmarks for student 
  performance in each of the core subjects identified in the National 
  Education Goals; and
Whereas a knowledge of world geography is essential for citizens of the 
  United States to assume a responsible role in the future of an 
  increasingly interconnected and interdependent world: Now, therefore, 
  be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning 
November 14, 1993, and the week beginning November 13, 1994, each be 
designated as ``Geography Awareness Week'',
and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe such weeks with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
