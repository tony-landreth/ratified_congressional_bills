                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating the month of November in each of calendar years 1993 and 
1994 as ``National American Indian Heritage Month''.

Whereas American Indians were the original inhabitants of the lands 
  that now constitute the United States of America;
Whereas American Indian Governments developed the fundamental 
  principles of freedom of speech and separation of powers in 
  government, and these principles form the foundation of the United 
  States Government today;
Whereas American Indian societies have exhibited a respect for the 
  finiteness of natural resources through deep respect for the earth, 
  and these values continue to be widely held today;
Whereas American Indian people have served with valor in all wars from 
  the Revolutionary War to the conflict in the Persian Gulf, often in a 
  percentage well above their percentage in the population of the 
  Nation as a whole;
Whereas American Indians have made distinct and important contributions 
  to America and the rest of the world in many fields, including 
  agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art;
Whereas American Indians deserve to be recognized for their individual 
  contributions to American society as artists, sculptors, musicians, 
  authors, poets, artisans, scientists, and scholars;
Whereas designating the month of November in each of calendar years 
  1993 and 1994 to recognize the heritage and the contributions to 
  American society of American Indians will encourage self-esteem, 
  pride, and self-awareness in American Indians of all ages; and
Whereas November is traditionally the month when American Indians have 
  harvested their crops and is generally a time of celebration and 
  giving thanks: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That--
        (1) the month of November in each of calendar years 1993 and 
    1994 is designated as ``National American Indian Heritage Month''; 
    and
        (2) the President is authorized and requested to issue a 
    proclamation in each of those years calling on the people of the 
    United States to observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and 
    activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
