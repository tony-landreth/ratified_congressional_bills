        S.J.Res. 150

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
 To designate the week of May 2 through May 8, 1994, as ``Public Service

                           Recognition Week''.

Whereas public employees at every level of government faithfully serve 
  their fellow Americans;
Whereas there are 9,000,000 employees in local government, 4,000,000 
  employees in State government, and over 3,000,000 civilian workers 
  and 2,000,000 military employees in the Federal Government;
Whereas Americans are aware of the many contributions public employees 
  have made to the quality of their lives, in occupations that run the 
  gamut from astronauts to zoologists, including scientists, police 
  officers, teachers, doctors, forest rangers, engineers, food 
  inspectors, researchers, and foreign service agents, among others;
Whereas the Nation should value a professional civil service whose 
  highest principle is one of patriotism, whose foremost commitment is 
  to excellence, and whose experience and expertise are a national 
  resource to be used and respected;
Whereas the millions of workers who serve our country are men and women 
  of knowledge, ability, and integrity who deserve to be recognized for 
  their dedicated service; and
Whereas designating a week to honor these employees will provide a dual 
  opportunity to pay tribute to our public employees and to inform the 
  American people about the scope and importance of public service, 
  including the range of employment opportunities available to our 
  young people: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week of May 2 through 
May 8, 1994, is designated as ``Public Service
Recognition Week''. The President is authorized and requested to issue 
a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe 
the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
