Whereas accurate, timely, and complete medical records and related 
  health information are vital in planning and providing for quality 
  health care for the people of the United States;
Whereas such records and information are vital to providing health care 
  to an individual beginning at the birth of the individual and 
  continuing throughout the life of the individual;
Whereas public concern about the quality, appropriateness, and 
  effectiveness of health care is escalating;
Whereas specific skills in evaluating and reporting the results of 
  health care are required to provide public accountability;
Whereas equitable third-party reimbursement for health care is dependent 
  on health information that is collected, analyzed, classified, 
  verified, and disseminated;
Whereas public awareness of patient rights, including the right of a 
  patient to access the patient's own medical information, is 
  increasing;
Whereas the needs and requirements for health information of the health 
  care industry and the use of the information by the industry are 
  changing rapidly;
Whereas the rate of such changes will continue to increase as new health 
  care technology is used and new health care reform policies are 
  promulgated;
Whereas the 35,000 members of the American Health Information Management 
  Association are the health information leaders of the United States; 
  and
Whereas such members have demonstrated commitment to, and expertise in, 
  health information management: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning October 
31, 1993, is designated as ``National Health Information Management 
Week'', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe the 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
