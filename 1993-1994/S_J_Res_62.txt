                                 of the

                            Joint Resolution


 
   To designate the week beginning April 25, 1993, as ``National Crime

                         Victims' Rights Week''.

Whereas there were over thirty-five million crimes committed last year 
  in America, with one violent crime occurring every seventeen seconds;
Whereas victims of crime across America deserve respect and assistance 
  not only from the criminal justice system, but from society as well;
Whereas there is a crucial need to provide crime victims with quality 
  programs and services to help them recover from the devastating 
  psychological, physical, emotional, and financial hardships resulting 
  from their victimization;
Whereas there are ten thousand public and private agencies and 
  organizations in the United States that are dedicated to improving the 
  plight of crime victims;
Whereas the Nation's victims' rights movement and allied professions 
  deserve recognition for their tireless efforts on behalf of victims of 
  crime and to reduce senseless violence in America; and
Whereas it is essential for all Americans to join together and commit 
  their individual and collective resources to victim assistance and 
  violence reduction: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning April 
25, 1993, is hereby designated as ``National Crime Victims' Rights 
Week''. The President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                                                President of the Senate.
