    border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas.
        (2) Fees collected under the authority of subsection (a) shall 
    be deposited as an offsetting collection to any Department of State 
    appropriation, to recover the costs of providing consular services. 
    Such fees shall remain available for obligation until expended.
        (3) For fiscal years 1994 and 1995, fees deposited under the 
    authority of paragraph (2) may not exceed a total of $107,500,000. 
    For subsequent fiscal years, fees may be collected under the 
    authority of paragraph (1) only in such amounts as shall be 
    prescribed in subsequent authorization Acts.
        (4) The provisions of the Act of August 18, 1856 (Revised 
    Statutes 1726-28; 22 U.S.C. 4212-14), concerning accounting for 
    consular fees shall not apply to fees collected under this 
    subsection.
        (5) No fee or surcharge authorized under paragraph (1) may be 
    charged to a citizen of a country that is a signatory as of the 
    date of enactment of this Act to the North American Free Trade 
    Agreement, except that the Secretary of State may charge such fee 
    or surcharge to a citizen of such a country if the Secretary 
    determines that such country charges a visa application or issuance 
    fee to citizens of the United States.
    (b) Automated Visa Lookout System._Not later than 18 months after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall 
implement an upgrade of all overseas visa lookout operations to 
computerized systems with automated multiple-name search capabilities.
    (c) Processing of Visas for Admission to the United States._
        (1)(A) Beginning 24 months after the date of the enactment of 
    this Act, whenever a United States consular officer issues a visa 
    for admission to the United States, that official shall certify, in 
    writing, that a check of the Automated Visa Lookout System, or any 
    other system or list which maintains information about the 
    excludability of aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
    has been made and that there is no basis under such system for the 
    exclusion of such alien.
        (B) If, at the time an alien applies for an immigrant or 
    nonimmigrant visa, the alien's name is included in the Department 
    of State's visa lookout system and the consular officer to whom the 
    application is made fails to follow the procedures in processing 
    the application required by the inclusion of the alien's name in 
    such system, the consular officer's failure shall be made a matter 
    of record and shall be considered as a serious negative factor in 
    the officer's annual performance evaluation.
        (2) If an alien to whom a visa was issued as a result of a 
    failure described in paragraph (1)(B) is admitted to the United 
    States and there is thereafter probable cause to believe that the

    life or property in the United States, the Secretary of State shall

    III of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of

    Identification Index of the National Crime Information Center 
    solely for the purpose of determining whether a visa applicant has 
    a criminal history record indexed in such Index. Such access does 
    not entitle the Department of State to obtain the full content of 
    automated records through the Interstate Identification Index. To 
    obtain the full content of a criminal history record, the 
    Department shall submit a separate request to the Identification 
    Records Section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and shall 
    pay the appropriate fee as provided for in the Departments of 
    Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies

    establishing and maintaining the access authorized in paragraph

SEC. 142. WOMEN'S HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION.

    (a) Sense of Congress._The Congress makes the following 
declarations:
        (1) The State Department should designate a senior advisor to 
    the appropriate Undersecretary to promote international women's 
    human rights within the overall human rights policy of the United 
    States Government.
        (2) The purpose of assigning a special assistant on women's 
    human rights issues is not, to segregate such issues, but rather to 
    assure that they are considered along with other human rights 
    issues in the development of United States foreign policy.
        (3) A specifically designated special assistant is necessary 
    because within the human rights field and the foreign policy 
    establishment, the issues of gender-based discrimination and 
    violence against women have long been ignored or made invisible.
        (4) The Congress believes that abuses against women would have 
    greater visibility and protection of women's human rights would 
    improve if the advocate were responsible for integrating women's 
    human rights issues into United States foreign policy, bilateral 
    assistance, multilateral diplomacy, trade policy, and democracy 
    promotion.
    (b) Congressional Notification._Not later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall notify the 
Congress of the steps taken to fulfill the objectives detailed in 
subsection (a).

accommodate the broadcasting activities of Radio Free Asia. The 
Chairman of the Board shall consult with such committees on the impact 
of any such reduction in Voice of America broadcasting activities.
    (i) Not a Federal Agency or Instrumentality._Nothing in this title

    transferred for that operation during a fiscal year does not exceed 
    the total United States assessed contribution payable for that 
    operation from that account during that fiscal year.

    Defense (or the Coast Guard);

    the President may direct the crating, packing, handling, and

defense articles under this section and to any costs of crating,

to be appropriated for ``Assessed Contributions to International 
Organizations'' by this Act, the President may withhold 20 percent of

are the major financial contributors to such assessed budgets.

consultation between the President (or the President's representative) 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.
    (c) Contributions for Prior Years._Subject to the availability of 
appropriations, payment of assessed contributions for prior years may 
be made to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies 
notwithstanding subsection (a) if such payment would further United 
States interests in that organization.
    (d) Report to Congress._Not later than February 1 of each year, the 
President shall submit to the Congress a report concerning the amount 
of United States assessed contributions paid to the United Nations and 
each of its specialized agencies during the preceding calendar year.

    grants full membership as a state to any organization or group that

    statehood, or
        (2) to the United Nations, if the United Nations grants full

        (1) The effectiveness of the United Nations Security Council in 
    maintaining international peace and security depends on its being

        (2) The requirement of equitable geographic distribution in 
    Article 23 of the United Nations Charter requires that the members 
    of the Security Council of the United Nations be chosen by 
    nondiscriminatory means.
        (3) The use of informal regional groups of the General Assembly 
    as the sole means for election of the nonpermanent members of the 
    Security Council is inherently discriminatory in the absence of 
    guarantees that all member states will have the opportunity to join 
    a regional group, and has resulted in discrimination against 
    Israel.
    (b) Sense of Congress._It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should direct the Secretary of State to request the Secretary 
General of the United Nations to seek immediate resolution of the 
problem described in this section. The President shall inform the

    following reforms in the Food and Agriculture Organization:

        member states, and a more meaningful and direct role for member 
        states in the decisionmaking process.
            (B) Reform of the FAO Council, including formation of an 
        executive management committee to provide oversight of 
        management.
            (C) Limitation of the term of the Director General and the 
        number of terms which an individual may serve.
            (D) Restructuring of the Technical Cooperation Program 
        (TCP), including reducing the number of nonemergency projects 
        funded through the TCP and establishing procedures to deploy 
        TCP consultants, supplies, and equipment in a timely manner.
        (2) In an effort to increase the presence of United States 
    personnel at the international food agencies and to enhance the 
    professionalism of these institutions, it should be the policy of 
    the United States, to the maximum extent practicable, to utilize 
    existing personnel programs such as the United States Department of 
    Agriculture Associate Professional Officer program to place United 
    States personnel with unique skills in the Food and Agriculture 
    Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, 
    and the World Food Program.

    (a) Findings._The Senate makes the following findings:
        (1) In an Executive Order of May 28, 1993, the President 
    established conditions for renewal of most-favored-nation (MFN) 
    status for the People's Republic of China in 1994.
        (2) The Executive Order requires that in making a 
    recommendation about the further extension of MFN status to China, 
    the Secretary of State shall not recommend extension unless the 
    Secretary determines that_
            (A) extension will substantially promote the freedom of 
        emigration objectives of section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974; 
        and
            (B) China is complying with the 1992 bilateral agreement 
        between the United States and China concerning prison labor.
        (3) The Executive Order further requires that in making a 
    recommendation, the Secretary of State shall determine whether 
    China has made overall, significant progress with respect to_
            (A) taking steps to begin adhering to the Universal 
        Declaration of Human Rights;
            (B) releasing and providing an acceptable accounting for 
        Chinese citizens imprisoned or detained for the non-violent 
        expression of their political and religious beliefs, including 
        such expression of religious beliefs in connection with the 
        Democracy Wall and Tiananmen Square movements;
            (C) ensuring humane treatment of prisoners, such as by 
        allowing access to prisons by international humanitarian and 
        human rights organizations;
            (D) protecting Tibet's distinctive religious and cultural 
        heritage; and
            (E) permitting international radio and television 
        broadcasts into China.
        (4) The Executive Order further requires the Executive Branch 
    to resolutely pursue all legislative and executive actions to 
    ensure that China abides by its commitments to follow fair, 
    nondiscriminatory trade practices in dealing with United States 
    businesses, and adheres to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the 
    Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines and parameters, and 
    other nonproliferation commitments.
        (5) The Chinese government should cooperate with international 
    efforts to obtain North Korea's full, unconditional compliance with 
    the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
        (6) The President has initiated an intensive high-level 
    dialogue with the Chinese government which began last year with a 
    meeting between the Secretary of State and the Chinese Foreign 
    Minister, including a meeting in Seattle between the President and 
    the President of China, meetings in Beijing with the Secretary of 
    the Treasury, the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and others, 
    a recent meeting in Paris between the Secretary of State and the 
    Chinese Foreign Minister, and recent meetings in Washington with 
    several Under Secretaries and their Chinese counterparts.
        (7) The President's efforts have led to some recent progress on 
    some issues of concern to the United States.
        (8) Notwithstanding this, substantially more progress is needed 
    to meet the standards in the President's Executive Order.
        (9) The Chinese government's overall human rights record in 
    1993 fell far short of internationally accepted norms as it 
    continued to repress critics and failed to control abuses by its 
    own security forces.
    (b) Sense of Senate._It is the sense of the Senate that the 
President of the United States should use all appropriate 
opportunities, in particular more high-level exchanges with the Chinese 
government, to press for further concrete progress toward meeting the 
standards for continuation of MFN status as contained in the Executive 
Order.

SEC. 514. IMPLEMENTATION OF PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE.

    (a) Report to Congress._The President shall submit annually, 
beginning 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, a detailed 
report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on the 
implementation of the ``Partnership for Peace'' initiative, including 
an assessment of the progress made by former members of the Warsaw 
Treaty Organization in meeting the criteria for full membership 
articulated in Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, wherein any 
other European state may, by unanimous agreement, be invited to accede 
to the North Atlantic Treaty if it is in a position to further the 
principles of the Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North 
Atlantic area.
    (b) Authority of the President._The President is authorized to 
confer, pursuant to agreement with any country eligible to participate

related civilian personnel (including dependents of any such personnel) 
and activities of that country in the United States comparable to the 
rights conferred by that country in respect of the military and related 
civilian personnel (including dependents of any such personnel) and 
activities of the United States in that country.

SEC. 515. POLICY TOWARD THAILAND, CAMBODIA, LAOS, AND BURMA.

    It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) the creation of a new Cambodian government through United 
    Nations sponsored elections offers a unique opportunity for the 
    revival of the Cambodian nation, an opportunity which the United 
    States should help realize;
        (2) the President should enunciate a clear policy toward Burma 
    and, in so doing, be guided by the approach in Senate Resolution 
    112;
        (3) the government and people of Thailand are to be commended 
    for Thailand's return to civilian, democratic rule, and for its 
    contribution to the implementation of the Paris Peace Accords on 
    Cambodia;
        (4) the President of the United States should convey to 
    Thailand United States concern over the continued support for the 
    Khmer Rouge by elements of the Thai military and to urge the Thai 
    Government to intensify its efforts to terminate that support, in 
    accordance with the Paris Peace Accords;
        (5) the Government of Thailand should continue to allow the 
    democratic leaders of Burma to operate freely within Thailand and 
    to grant them free passage to allow them to present their case at 
    the United Nations and other international gatherings;
        (6) the President of the United States should urge the 
    Government of Thailand to prosecute, with the full force of law, 
    those responsible for the trafficking, forced labor, and physical 
    and sexual abuse of women and children in Thailand, and to protect 
    the civil and human rights of Burmese women in Thailand and prevent 
    their further victimization; and
        (7) the United States should work with the United Nations High 
    Commissioner for Refugees, the Government of Thailand, and other 
    relevant parties to ensure that the rights of asylum seekers in 
    Thailand, and in particular the Hmong people from Laos, are fully 
    respected and that force is not used in any repatriations.

SEC. 516. PEACE PROCESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should_
        (1) strongly encourage all parties to the conflict in the North 
    of Ireland to renounce violence and to participate in the current 
    search for peace in the region; and
        (2) assist in furthering the peace process where appropriate.
    SEC. 517. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN 
      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.
    (a) Senate Findings._The Senate makes the following findings:
        (1) The freedom and security of the international community 
    rests on the sanctity of the rule of law.
        (2) The international community is increasingly threatened by 
    unlawful acts such as war crimes, genocide, aggression, crimes 
    against humanity, terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, 
    and other crimes of an international character.
        (3) The prosecution of individuals suspected of carrying out 
    such acts is often impeded by political and legal obstacles such as 
    amnesties, disputes over extradition, differences in the structure 
    and capabilities of national courts, and the lack of uniform 
    guidelines under which to try such individuals.
        (4) The war crimes trials held in the aftermath of World War II 
    at Nuremberg, Germany, and Tokyo, Japan, demonstrated that fair and 
    effective prosecution of war criminals could be carried out in an 
    international forum.
        (5) Since its inception in 1945 the United Nations has sought 
    to build on the precedent established at the Nuremberg and Tokyo 
    trials by establishing a permanent international criminal court 
    with jurisdiction over crimes of an international character.
        (6) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 44/39, adopted 
    on December 4, 1989, called on the International Law Commission to 
    study the feasibility of an international criminal court.
        (7) In the years after passage of that resolution the 
    International Law Commission has taken a number of steps to advance 
    the debate over such a court, including_
            (A) the provisional adoption of a draft Code of Crimes 
        Against the Peace and Security of Mankind;
            (B) the creation of a Working Group on an International 
        Criminal Jurisdiction and the formulation by that Working Group 
        of several concrete proposals for the establishment and 
        operation of an international criminal court; and
            (C) the determination that an international criminal court 
        along the lines of that suggested by the Working Group is 
        feasible and that the logical next step would be to proceed 
        with the formal drafting of a statute for such a court.
        (8) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 47/33, adopted 
    on November 25, 1992, called on the International Law Commission to 
    begin the process of drafting a statute for an international 
    criminal court at its next session.
        (9) Given the developments of recent years, the time is 
    propitious for the United States to lend its support to this 
    effort.
    (b) Sense of the Senate._It is the sense of the Senate that_
        (1) the establishment of an international criminal court with 
    jurisdiction over crimes of an international character would 
    greatly strengthen the international rule of law;
        (2) such a court would thereby serve the interests of the 
    United States and the world community; and
        (3) the United States delegation should make every effort to 
    advance this proposal at the United Nations.
    (c) Required Report._Not later than 14 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act the President shall submit to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate a detailed report on developments 
relating to, and United States efforts in support of, the establishment 
of an international criminal court with jurisdiction over crimes of an 
international character.

SEC. 518. INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT PARTICIPATION.

    The United States Senate will not consent to the ratification of a 
treaty providing for United States participation in an international 
criminal court with jurisdiction over crimes of an international nature 
which permits representatives of any terrorist organization, including 
but not limited to the Palestine Liberation Organization, or citizens, 
nationals or residents of any country listed by the Secretary of State 
under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 as having 
repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, to sit 
in judgement on American citizens.
    SEC. 519. PROTECTION OF FIRST AND FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
    The United States Senate will not consent to the ratification of 
any Treaty providing for United States participation in an 
international criminal court with jurisdiction over crimes of an 
international character unless American citizens are guaranteed, in the 
terms establishing such a court, and in the court's operation, that the 
court will take no action infringing upon or diminishing their rights 
under the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution of the United 
States, as interpreted by the United States.
    SEC. 520. POLICY ON TERMINATION OF UNITED STATES ARMS EMBARGO.
    (a) Findings._The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On July 10, 1991, the United States adopted a policy 
    suspending all licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise 
    transfer defense articles and defense services to Yugoslavia.
        (2) On September 25, 1991, the United Nations Security Council 
    adopted Resolution 713, which imposed a mandatory international 
    embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to 
    Yugoslavia.
        (3) The United States considered the policy adopted July 10, 
    1991, to comply fully with Resolution 713 and therefore took no 
    additional action in response to that resolution.
        (4) On January 8, 1992, the United Nations Security Council 
    adopted Resolution 727, which decided that the mandatory arms 
    embargo imposed by Resolution 713 should apply to any independent 
    states that might thereafter emerge on the territory of Yugoslavia.
        (5) On February 29 and March 1, 1992, the people of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina voted in a referendum to declare independence from 
    Yugoslavia.
        (6) On April 7, 1992, the United States recognized the 
    Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        (7) On May 22, 1992, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
    was admitted to full membership in the United Nations.
        (8) Consistent with Resolution 727, the United States has 
    continued to apply the policy adopted July 10, 1991, to independent 
    states that have emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, 
    including Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        (9) Subsequent to the adoption of Resolution 727 and Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina's independence referendum, the siege of Sarajevo began 
    and fighting spread to other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        (10) The Government of Serbia intervened directly in the 
    fighting by providing significant military, financial, and 
    political support and direction to Serbian-allied irregular forces 
    in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        (11) In statements dated May 1 and May 12, 1992, the Conference 
    on Security and Cooperation in Europe declared that the Government 
    of Serbia and the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav National Army were 
    committing aggression against the Government of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina and assigned to them prime responsibility for the 
    escalation of bloodshed and destruction.
        (12) On May 30, 1992, the United Nations Security Council 
    adopted Resolution 757, which condemned the Government of Serbia 
    for its continued failure to respect the territorial integrity of 
    Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        (13) Serbian-allied irregular forces have occupied 
    approximately 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina, committed gross violations of human rights in the 
    areas they have occupied, and established a secessionist government 
    committed to eventual unification with Serbia.
        (14) The military and other support and direction provided to 
    Serbian-allied irregular forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
    constitutes an armed attack on the Government of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina by the Government of Serbia within the meaning of 
    Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
        (15) Under Article 51, the Government of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina, as a member of the United Nations, has an inherent 
    right of individual or collective self-defense against the armed 
    attack from the Government of Serbia until the United Nations 
    Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain 
    international peace and security.
        (16) The measures taken by the United Nations Security Council 
    in response to the armed attack on Bosnia and Herzegovina have not 
    been adequate to maintain international peace and security.
        (17) Bosnia and Herzegovina have been unable successfully to 
    resist the armed attack from Serbia because it lacks the means to 
    counter heavy weaponry that Serbia obtained from the Yugoslav 
    National Army upon the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and because the 
    mandatory international arms embargo has prevented Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina from obtaining from other countries the means to 
    counter such heavy weaponry.
        (18) On December 18, 1992, with the affirmative vote of the 
    United States, the United Nations General Assembly adopted 
    Resolution 47/121, which urged the United Nations Security Council 
    to exempt Bosnia and Herzegovina from the mandatory arms embargo 
    imposed by Resolution 713.
        (19) In the absence of adequate measures to maintain 
    international peace and security, continued application to the 
    Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the mandatory international 
    arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council prior 
    to the armed attack on Bosnia and Herzegovina undermines that 
    government's right of individual or collective self-defense and 
    therefore contravenes Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
        (20) Bosnia and Herzegovina's right of self-defense under 
    Article 51 of the United Nations Charter includes the right to ask 
    for military assistance from other countries and to receive such 
    assistance if offered.
    (b) Policy on Termination of Arms Embargo._(1) It is the sense of 
the Congress that the President should terminate the United States arms 
embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina upon receipt from 
that government of a request for assistance in exercising its right of 
self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
    (2) As used in this subsection, the term ``United States arms 
embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina'' means the 
application to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina of_
        (A) the policy adopted July 10, 1991, and published in the 
    Federal Register of July 19, 1991 (58 Fed. Reg. 33322) under the 
    heading ``Suspension of Munitions Export Licenses to Yugoslavia''; 
    and
        (B) any similar policy being applied by the United States 
    Government as of the date of receipt of the request described in 
    subsection (a) pursuant to which approval is routinely denied for 
    transfers of defense articles and defense services to the former 
    Yugoslavia.
    (c) Policy on Military Assistance._The President should provide 
appropriate military assistance to the Government of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina upon receipt from that government of a request for 
assistance in exercising its right of self-defense under Article 51 of 
the United Nations Charter.

SEC. 521. SENSE OF SENATE ON RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM.

    It is the sense of the Senate that_
        (1) the Government of the United States is committed to seeking 
    the fullest possible accounting of American servicemen unaccounted 
    for during the war in Vietnam;
        (2) cooperation by the Government of Vietnam on resolving the 
    fate of those American servicemen unaccounted for has increased 
    significantly over the last three years and is essential to the 
    resolution of outstanding POW/MIA cases;
        (3) substantial and tangible progress has been made in the POW/
    MIA accounting process;
        (4) cooperative efforts between the United States and Vietnam 
    should continue in order to resolve all outstanding questions 
    concerning the fate of Americans missing-in-action;
        (5) United States senior military commanders and United States 
    personnel working in the field to account for United States POW/
    MIAs in Vietnam believe that lifting the United States trade 
    embargo against Vietnam will facilitate and accelerate the 
    accounting efforts;
        (6) therefore, in order to maintain and expand further United 
    States and Vietnamese efforts to obtain the fullest possible 
    accounting, the President should lift the United States trade 
    embargo against Vietnam expeditiously; and
        (7) moveover, as the United States and Vietnam move toward 
    normalization of relations, the Government of Vietnam should 
    demonstrate further improvements in meeting internationally 
    recognized standards of human rights.

    from Vietnam;

    (2) The authorities conferred upon the President by section 5(b) of

SEC. 529. UNITED STATES POLICY ON NORTH KOREA.

    It is the sense of the Congress that:
        (1) It is in the United States national security interest to 
    curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
    particularly nuclear weapons.
        (2) The North Korea nuclear weapons program is one of the most 
    pressing national security challenges the United States currently 
    faces.
        (3) North Korea's development of other weapons of mass 
    destruction and of ballistic missiles further threatens United 
    States national security interests and regional security.
        (4) United States policy should ensure that North Korea does 
    not possess a nuclear bomb or the capability to build one.
        (5) United States forces in Korea must remain vigilant and 
    maintain a robust defense posture.
        (6) While diplomacy is the preferable method of dealing with 
    the North Korean nuclear challenge, all options, including the 
    appropriate use of force, remain available.
        (7) In fashioning an appropriate policy for dealing with the 
    challenge presented by North Korea's nuclear program, the 
    Administration should consult closely with United States treaty 
    allies, particularly Japan and the Republic of Korea, as well as 
    with China, Russia, and other members of the United Nations 
    Security Council.
        (8) United States policy should support the efforts of the 
    International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as the international 
    community's designated body for verifying compliance with the 
    Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to perform inspections of North 
    Korea's nuclear program.
        (9) The United States should encourage strong and expeditious 
    action by the United Nations Security Council inasmuch as North 
    Korea has proved unwilling to comply fully with the following:
            (A) North Korea's December 1991 denuclearization agreement 
        with South Korea pledging not to possess, manufacture, or use 
        nuclear weapons, not to possess plutonium reprocessing 
        facilities, and to negotiate the establishment of a nuclear 
        inspection system.
            (B) The nuclear safeguards agreement North Korea signed 
        with the IAEA on January 30, 1992.
            (C) The agreement on IAEA inspections North Korea accepted 
        on February 15, 1994.
        (10) Unless North Korea unequivocally adheres to the Nuclear 
    Nonproliferation Treaty and abides by all provisions of that 
    treaty, the President should seek international consensus to 
    isolate North Korea, including the imposition of sanctions, in an 
    effort to persuade Pyongyang to halt its nuclear weapons program 
    and permit IAEA inspections of all its nuclear facilities.
        (11) Recognizing that within the international community China 
    has significant influence over Pyongyang, the nature and extent of 
    Chinese cooperation with the rest of the international community on 
    the North Korean nuclear issue, including Chinese support for 
    international sanctions should such sanctions be proposed and/or 
    adopted, will inevitably be a significant factor in United States-
    China relations.
        (12) If unable to achieve an international consensus to isolate 
    North Korea, the President should employ all unilateral means of 
    leverage over North Korea, including, but not limited to, the 
    prohibition of any transaction involving the commercial sale of any 
    good or technology to North Korea.
        (13) The President should consult with United States allies in 
    the region regarding the military posture of North Korea and the 
    ability of the United States and its allies to deter a North Korean 
    attack, or to defeat such an attack should it occur.
        (14) Toward these ends, the United States and South Korea 
    should take all steps necessary to ensure that United States and 
    South Korean forces stationed on the Korean peninsula can defend 
    themselves, including the holding of Team Spirit or other joint 
    military exercises, the deployment of Patriot missiles to South 
    Korea, and other appropriate measures.
        (15) The problem posed by North Korea's nuclear program is not 
    a bilateral problem between the United States and North Korea, but 
    a problem in which virtually the entire global community is united 
    against North Korea.
        (16) The international community must insist upon full 
    compliance by North Korea with all its nonproliferation commitments 
    including acceptance of regular and ad hoc inspections of its 
    declared nuclear facilities on a continuing basis, as well as 
    special inspections of all suspected nuclear sites as the IAEA 
    deems appropriate.
        (17) International concerns about North Korea's nuclear 
    intentions and capabilities will not be adequately addressed until 
    North Korea cooperates fully with the IAEA, all North Korea nuclear 
    facilities and materials are placed under fullscope safeguards, and 
    North Korea adheres unequivocally to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
    Treaty as well as to its 1991 denuclearization agreement with South 
    Korea.
        (18) The Administration should work to encourage a productive 
    dialogue between North and South Korea that adequately addresses 
    all security concerns on the Korean peninsula.

SEC. 530. ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROLIFERATION TREATIES.

    (a) Policy._It is the sense of the Congress that the President 
should instruct the United States Permanent Representative to the 
United Nations to enhance the role of that institution in the 
enforcement of nonproliferation treaties through the passage of a 
United Nations Security Council resolution which would state that, any 
non-nuclear weapon state that is found by the United Nations Security 
Council, in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), to have terminated, abrogated, or materially violated an IAEA 
full-scope safeguards agreement would be subjected to international 
economic sanctions, the scope of which to be determined by the United 
Nations Security Council.
    (b) Prohibition._Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
United States assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall

President to have terminated, abrogated, or materially violated an IAEA 
full-scope safeguard agreement or materially violated a bilateral 
United States nuclear cooperation agreement entered into after the date 
of enactment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.
    (c) Waiver._The President may waive the application of subsection 
(b) if_
        (1) the President determines that the termination of such 
    assistance would be seriously prejudicial to the achievement of 
    United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize 
    the common defense and security; and
        (2) the President reports such determination to the Congress at 
    least 15 days in advance of any resumption of assistance to that 
    state.

    reaffirmed.
        (2) Section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act take primacy over 
    statements of United States policy, including communiques, 
    regulations, directives, and policies based thereon.
        (3) In assessing the extent to which the People's Republic of 
    China is pursuing its ``fundamental policy'' to strive peacefully 
    to resolve the Taiwan issue, the United States should take into 
    account both the capabilities and intentions of the People's 
    Republic of China.
        (4) The President should on a regular basis assess changes in 
    the capabilities and intentions of the People's Republic of China 
    and consider whether it is appropriate to adjust arms sales to 
    Taiwan accordingly.
    SEC. 532. WAIVER OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
      OF YUGOSLAVIA TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY ABROAD.

against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia those United States-
supported programs, projects, or activities involving reform of the 
electoral process, or the development of democratic institutions or 
democratic political parties.
    (b) Policy._The President, acting through the United States 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should propose that any 
action, past or future, by the Security Council pursuant to Article 41 
of the United Nations Charter, with respect to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, should take account of the exemption described in 
subsection (a).
    SEC. 533. FREEDOM OF INFORMATION EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN OPEN SKIES

        (1) it is the sense of the Congress that the United States 
    should seek to establish a dialogue with those recognized by

        (1) In general._Except as provided in subsection (b)(2), the 
    President shall impose the sanction described in subsection (c) if 
    the President determines in writing that, on or after the effective 
    date of this part, a foreign person or a United States person has 
    materially and with requisite knowledge contributed, through the 
    export from the United States or any other country of any goods or 
    technology (as defined in section 830(2)), to the efforts by any 
    individual, group, or non-nuclear-weapon state to acquire 
    unsafeguarded special nuclear material or to use, develop, produce,

        (2) Persons against which the sanction is to be imposed._The 
    sanction shall be imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) on_
            (A) the foreign person or United States person with respect 
        to which the President makes the determination described in 
        that paragraph;
            (B) any successor entity to that foreign person or United 
        States person;
            (C) any foreign person or United States person that is a 
        parent or subsidiary of that person if that parent or 
        subsidiary materially and with requisite knowledge assisted in 
        the activities which were the basis of that determination; and
            (D) any foreign person or United States person that is an 
        affiliate of that person if that affiliate materially and with 
        requisite knowledge assisted in the activities which were the 
        basis of that determination and if that affiliate is controlled 
        in fact by that person.
        (3) Other sanctions available._The sanction which is required 
    to be imposed for activities described in this subsection is in 
    addition to any other sanction which may be imposed for the same 
    activities under any other provision of law.
        (4) Definition._For purposes of this subsection, the term 
    ``requisite knowledge'' means situations in which a person

    (b) Consultation With and Actions by Foreign Government of 
Jurisdiction._
        (1) Consultations._If the President makes a determination 
    described in subsection (a)(1) with respect to a foreign person, 
    the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations 
    immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction over that 
    foreign person with respect to the imposition of the sanction 
    pursuant to this section.
        (2) Actions by government of jurisdiction._In order to pursue 
    such consultations with that government, the President may delay 
    imposition of the sanction pursuant to this section for up to 90 
    days. Following these consultations, the President shall impose the 
    sanction unless the President determines and certifies in writing 
    to the Congress that that government has taken specific and 
    effective actions, including appropriate penalties, to terminate 
    the involvement of the foreign person in the activities described 
    in subsection (a)(1). The President may delay the imposition of the 
    sanction for up to an additional 90 days if the President 
    determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that that 
    government is in the process of taking the actions described in the 
    preceding sentence.
        (3) Report to congress._Not later than 90 days after making a 
    determination under subsection (a)(1), the President shall submit 
    to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on 
    Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign

    (2) of this subsection, that the United States Government shall not 
    procure, or enter into any contract for the procurement of, any

        (2) Exceptions._The President shall not be required to apply or 
    maintain the sanction under this section_
            (A) in the case of procurement of defense articles or 
        defense services_
                (i) under existing contracts or subcontracts, including 
            the exercise of options for production quantities to 
            satisfy requirements essential to the national security of 
            the United States;
                (ii) if the President determines in writing that the 
            person or other entity to which the sanction would 
            otherwise be applied is a sole source supplier of the 
            defense articles or services, that the defense articles or 
            services are essential, and that alternative sources are 
            not readily or reasonably available; or
                (iii) if the President determines in writing that such 
            articles or services are essential to the national security 
            under defense coproduction agreements;
            (B) to products or services provided under contracts 
        entered into before the date on which the President publishes 
        his intention to impose the sanction;
            (C) to_
                (i) spare parts which are essential to United States 
            products or production;
                (ii) component parts, but not finished products, 
            essential to United States products or production; or
                (iii) routine servicing and maintenance of products, to 
            the extent that alternative sources are not readily or 
            reasonably available;

        States products or production; or

    (d) Advisory Opinions._Upon the request of any person, the 
Secretary of State may, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, 
issue in writing an advisory opinion to that person as to whether a 
proposed activity by that person would subject that person to the 
sanction under this section. Any person who relies in good faith on 
such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity would 
not subject a person to such sanction, and any person who thereafter 
engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such sanction on 
account of such activity.
    (e) Termination of the Sanction._The sanction imposed pursuant to 
this section shall apply for a period of at least 12 months following 
the imposition of the sanction and shall cease to apply thereafter only 
if the President determines and certifies in writing to the Congress 
that_
        (1) reliable information indicates that the foreign person or 
    United States person with respect to which the determination was 
    made under subsection (a)(1) has ceased to aid or abet any 
    individual, group, or non-nuclear-weapon state in its efforts to 
    acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material or any nuclear 
    explosive device, as described in that subsection; and
        (2) the President has received reliable assurances from the 
    foreign person or United States person, as the case may be, that 
    such person will not, in the future, aid or abet any individual, 
    group, or non-nuclear-weapon state in its efforts to acquire 
    unsafeguarded special nuclear material or any nuclear explosive 
    device, as described in subsection (a)(1).
    (f) Waiver._
        (1) Criterion for waiver._The President may waive the 
    application of the sanction imposed on any person pursuant to this 
    section, after the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date 
    on which that sanction was imposed on that person, if the President 
    determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that the 
    continued imposition of the sanction would have a serious adverse 
    effect on vital United States interests.
        (2) Notification of and report to congress._If the President 
    decides to exercise the waiver authority provided in paragraph (1), 
    the President shall so notify the Congress not less than 20 days 
    before the waiver takes effect. Such notification shall include a 
    report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led 
    the President to exercise the waiver authority.

               PART C_INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY

SEC. 841. BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL INITIATIVES.

    It is the sense of the Congress that in order to maintain and 
enhance international confidence in the effectiveness of IAEA 
safeguards and in other multilateral undertakings to halt the global 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the United States should seek to 
negotiate with other nations and groups of nations, including the IAEA 
Board of Governors and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, to_
        (1) build international support for the principle that nuclear 
    supply relationships must require purchasing nations to agree to 
    full-scope international safeguards;
        (2) encourage each nuclear-weapon state within the meaning of 
    the Treaty to undertake a comprehensive review of its own 
    procedures for declassifying information relating to the design or 
    production of nuclear explosive devices and to investigate any 
    measures that would reduce the risk of such information 
    contributing to nuclear weapons proliferation;
        (3) encourage the deferral of efforts to produce weapons-grade 
    nuclear material for large-scale commercial uses until such time as 
    safeguards are developed that can detect, on a timely and reliable 
    basis, the diversion of significant quantities of such material for 
    nuclear explosive purposes;
        (4) pursue greater financial support for the implementation and 
    improvement of safeguards from all IAEA member nations with

    enriched uranium for use in research reactors while encouraging 
    multilateral cooperation to develop and to use low-enriched 
    alternative nuclear fuels;
        (7) oppose efforts by non-nuclear-weapon states to develop or 
    use unsafeguarded nuclear fuels for purposes of naval propulsion;
        (8) pursue an international open skies arrangement that would 
    authorize the IAEA to operate surveillance aircraft and would 
    facilitate IAEA access to satellite information for safeguards 
    verification purposes;
        (9) develop an institutional means for IAEA member nations to 
    share intelligence material with the IAEA on possible safeguards 
    violations without compromising national security or intelligence 
    sources or methods;
        (10) require any exporter of a sensitive nuclear facility or 
    sensitive nuclear technology to a non-nuclear-weapon state to 
    notify the IAEA prior to export and to require safeguards over that 
    facility or technology, regardless of its destination; and
        (11) seek agreement among the parties to the Treaty to apply 
    IAEA safeguards in perpetuity and to establish new limits on the 
    right to withdraw from the Treaty.

SEC. 842. IAEA INTERNAL REFORMS.

    In order to promote the early adoption of reforms in the 
implementation of the safeguards responsibilities of the IAEA, the 
Congress urges the President to negotiate with other nations and groups 
of nations, including the IAEA Board of Governors and the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group, to_
        (1) improve the access of the IAEA within nuclear facilities 
    that are capable of producing, processing, or fabricating special 
    nuclear material suitable for use in a nuclear explosive device;
        (2)(A) facilitate the IAEA's efforts to meet and to maintain 
    its own goals for detecting the diversion of nuclear materials and 
    equipment, giving particular attention to facilities in which there 
    are bulk quantities of plutonium; and
        (B) if it is not technically feasible for the IAEA to meet 
    those detection goals in a particular facility, require the IAEA to 
    declare publicly that it is unable to do so;
        (3) enable the IAEA to issue fines for violations of safeguards 
    procedures, to pay rewards for information on possible safeguards 
    violations, and to establish a ``hot line'' for the reporting of 
    such violations and other illicit uses of weapons-grade nuclear 
    material;
        (4) establish safeguards at facilities engaged in the 
    manufacture of equipment or material that is especially designated 
    or prepared for the processing, use, or production of special 
    fissionable material or, in the case of non-nuclear-weapon states, 
    of any nuclear explosive device;
        (5) establish safeguards over nuclear research and development 
    activities and facilities;
        (6) implement special inspections of undeclared nuclear 
    facilities, as provided for under existing safeguards procedures, 
    and seek authority for the IAEA to conduct challenge inspections on 
    demand at suspected nuclear sites;
        (7) expand the scope of safeguards to include tritium, uranium 
    concentrates, and nuclear waste containing special fissionable 
    material, and increase the scope of such safeguards on heavy water;
        (8) revise downward the IAEA's official minimum amounts of 
    nuclear material (``significant quantity'') needed to make a 
    nuclear explosive device and establish these amounts as national 
    rather than facility standards;
        (9) expand the use of full-time resident IAEA inspectors at 
    sensitive fuel cycle facilities;
        (10) promote the use of near real time material accountancy in 
    the conduct of safeguards at facilities that use, produce, or store 
    significant quantities of special fissionable material;
        (11) develop with other IAEA member nations an agreement on 
    procedures to expedite approvals of visa applications by IAEA 
    inspectors;
        (12) provide the IAEA the additional funds, technical 
    assistance, and political support necessary to carry out the goals 
    set forth in this subsection; and
        (13) make public the annual safeguards implementation report of 
    the IAEA, establishing a public registry of commodities in 
    international nuclear commerce, including dual-use goods, and 
    creating a public repository of current nuclear trade control laws, 
    agreements, regulations, and enforcement and judicial actions by 
    IAEA member nations.

   TITLE IX_COMMISSION ON PROTECTING AND REDUCING GOVERNMENT SECRECY

SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Protection and Reduction of 
Government Secrecy Act''.

SEC. 902. FINDINGS.

     The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed 
    which limited public access to information and reduced the ability 
    of the public to participate with full knowledge in the process of 
    governmental decisionmaking.
        (2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and 
    approximately three million persons held some form of security 
    clearance.
        (3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly classified 
    documents every year has led to tremendous administrative expense, 
    reduced communication within the government and within the 
    scientific community, reduced communication between the government 
    and the people of the United States, and the selective and 
    unauthorized public disclosure of classified information.
        (4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more 
    than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated 
    regulations for protecting classified information.
        (5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were 
    classified the information could be held more securely.
        (6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board 
    and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that ``more might be 
    gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt_unilaterally, if 
    necessary_a policy of complete openness in all areas of 
    information''.
        (7) The procedures for granting security clearances have 
    themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the secrecy 
    system and should be closely examined.
        (8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the 
    purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be 
    able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.

SEC. 903. PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year period 
a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy_
        (1) to examine the implications of the extensive classification 
    of information and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of 
    information classified and thereby to strengthen the protection of 
    legitimately classified information; and
        (2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current 
    procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.
