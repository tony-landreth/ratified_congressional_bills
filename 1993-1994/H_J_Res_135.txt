        H.J.Res.135
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
  To designate the months of May 1993 and May 1994 as ``National Trauma

                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas more than 9,000,000 individuals in the United States suffer 
  traumatic injury each year;
Whereas traumatic injury is the leading cause of death for individuals 
  under 44 years of age in the United States;
Whereas every individual is a potential victim of traumatic injury;
Whereas traumatic injury often occurs without warning;
Whereas traumatic injury frequently renders its victims incapable of 
  caring for themselves;
Whereas past inattention to the causes and effects of trauma has led to 
  the inclusion of trauma among the most neglected medical conditions in 
  the United States;
Whereas it is estimated that the people of the United States will spend 
  more than $175,000,000,000 this year on the problem of trauma;
Whereas trauma is preventable and increased efforts to prevent trauma 
  would reduce or eliminate deaths and disability due to trauma;
Whereas the problem of trauma can be remedied only by prevention and 
  treatment through emergency medical services and trauma systems; and
Whereas the people of the United States must be educated in the 
  prevention and treatment of trauma and in the proper and effective use 
  of emergency medical systems: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That May 1993 and May 1994 are 
each designated as ``National Trauma Awareness Month'' and the President 
is authorized and directed to issue a proclamation calling upon the 
people of the United States to observe these months with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
