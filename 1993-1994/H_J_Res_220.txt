        H.J.Res.220
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate the month of August as ``National Scleroderma Awareness 
Month'',

                         and for other purposes.

Whereas scleroderma is a disease caused by the excess production of 
  collagen, the main fibrous component of connective tissue, causing 
  hardening of the skin or internal organs, or both, such as the 
  esophagus, lungs, kidney, and heart;
Whereas approximately 300,000 people in the United States suffer from 
  scleroderma, with women of childbearing age outnumbering men 4 to 1;
Whereas scleroderma, a painful, crippling, and disfiguring disease, is 
  most often progressive and can result in premature death;
Whereas the symptoms of scleroderma are variable which can complicate 
  and confuse diagnosis;
Whereas the cause and cure of scleroderma are unknown; and
Whereas scleroderma is an orphan disease that requires intensive 
  research to improve treatment as well as find the cause and cure: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the months of August 1993 
and August 1994 are designated as ``National Scleroderma Awareness 
Month''. The President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each 
such month with appropriate activities that will enhance awareness of 
the disease and the need for a cure.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
