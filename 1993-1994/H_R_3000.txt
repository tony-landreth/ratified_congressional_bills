SEC. 3. DEFINITION.

    As used in this Act (including the amendments made by this Act), the 
terms ``independent states of the former Soviet Union'' and 
``independent states'' have the meaning given those terms by section 3 
of the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open 
Markets Support Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5801).
              TITLE I--POLICY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION

SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to amend or repeal numerous statutory 
provisions that restrict or otherwise impede normal relations between 
the United States and the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the other 
independent states of the former Soviet Union. All of the statutory 
provisions amended or repealed by this Act were relevant and appropriate 
at the time of enactment, but with the end of the Cold War, they have 
become obsolete. It is not the purpose of this Act to rewrite or erase 
history, or to forget those who suffered in the past from the injustices 
or repression of communist regimes in the Soviet Union, but rather to 
update United States law to reflect changed international circumstances 
and to demonstrate for reformers and democrats in the independent states 
of the former Soviet Union the resolve of the people of the United 
States to support the process of democratic and economic reform and to 
conduct business with those states in a new spirit of friendship and 
cooperation.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds and declares as follows:
        (1) The Vancouver Declaration issued by President Clinton and 
    President Yeltsin in April 1993 marked a new milestone in the 
    development of the spirit of cooperation and partnership between the 
    United States and Russia. The Congress affirms its support for the 
    principles contained in the Vancouver Declaration.
        (2) The Vancouver Declaration underscored that--
            (A) a dynamic and effective partnership between the United 
        States and Russia is vital to the success of Russia's historic 
        transformation;
            (B) the rapid integration of Russia into the community of 
        democratic nations and the world economy is important to the 
        national interest of the United States; and
            (C) cooperation between the United States and Russia is 
        essential to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts 
        and the promotion of democratic values, the protection of human 
        rights, and the solution of global problems such as 
        environmental pollution, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking.
        (3) The Congress enacted the FREEDOM Support Act (Public Law 
    102-511), as well as other legislation such as the Soviet Nuclear 
    Threat Reduction Act of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102-228) and 
    the Former Soviet Union Demilitarization Act of 1992 (title XIV of 
    Public Law 102-484), to help meet the historic opportunities and 
    challenges presented by the transformation that has taken place, and 
    is continuing to take place, in what once was the Soviet Union.
        (4) The process of reform in Russia, Ukraine, and the other 
    independent states of the former Soviet Union is ongoing. The 
    holding of a referendum in Russia on April 25, 1993, that was free 
    and fair, and that reflected the support of the Russian people for 
    the process of continued and strengthened democratic and economic 
    reform, represents an important and encouraging hallmark in this 
    ongoing process.
        (5) There remain in force many United States laws that are 
    relics of the Cold War, and repeals or revisions of these provisions 
    can play an important role in efforts to foster and strengthen the 
    bonds of trust and friendship, as well as mutually beneficial trade 
    and economic relations, between the United States and Russia, the 
    United States and Ukraine, and the United States and the other 
    independent states of the former Soviet Union.
    SEC. 103. STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLICABLE TO THE 
      SOVIET UNION.
    (a) In General.--There are numerous statutory provisions that were 
enacted in the context of United States relations with a country, the 
Soviet Union, that are fundamentally different from the relations that 
now exist between the United States and Russia, between the United 
States and Ukraine, and between the United States and the other 
independent states of the former Soviet Union.
    (b) Extent of Such Provisions.--Many of the provisions referred to 
in subsection (a) imposed limitations specifically with respect to the 
Soviet Union, and its constituent republics, or utilized language that 
reflected the tension that existed between the United States and the 
Soviet Union at the time of their enactment. Other such provisions did 
not refer specifically to the Soviet Union, but nonetheless were 
directed (or may be construed as having been directed) against the 
Soviet Union on the basis of the relations that formerly existed between 
the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in its role as the 
leading communist country.
    (c) Findings and Affirmation.--The Congress finds and affirms that 
provisions such as those described in this section, including--
        (1) section 216 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 
    1956 (22 U.S.C. 4316),
        (2) sections 136 and 804 of the Foreign Relations Authorization 
    Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public Law 99-93),
        (3) section 1222 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
    Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Public Law 100-204; 101 Stat. 1411),
        (4) the Multilateral Export Control Enhancement Amendments Act 
    (50 U.S.C. 2410 note, et seq.),
        (5) the joint resolution providing for the designation of 
    ``Captive Nations Week'' (Public Law 86-90),
        (6) the Communist Control Act of 1954 (Public Law 83-637),
        (7) provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
    1101 et seq.), including sections 101(a)(40), 101(e)(3), and 
    313(a)(3),
        (8) section 2 of the joint resolution entitled ``A joint 
    resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle East'', 
    approved March 9, 1957 (Public Law 85-7), and
        (9) section 43 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 
    286aa),
should not be construed as being directed against Russia, Ukraine, or 
the other independent states of the former Soviet Union, connoting an 
adversarial relationship between the United States and the independent 
states, or signifying or implying in any manner unfriendliness toward 
the independent states.
                 TITLE II--TRADE AND BUSINESS RELATIONS

SEC. 201. POLICY UNDER EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT.

    (a) Conforming Amendments.--Section 2 of the Export Administration 
Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401) is amended--
        (1) by striking paragraph (11); and
        (2) by redesignating paragraphs (12) and (13) as paragraphs (11) 
    and (12), respectively.
    (b) Policy Regarding KAL.--
        (1) The Congress finds that--
            (A) President Yeltsin should be commended for meeting 
        personally with representatives of the families of the victims 
        of the shootdown of Korean Airlines (KAL) Flight 7;
            (B) President Yeltsin's Government has met on two separate 
        occasions with United States Government and family members to 
        answer questions associated with the shootdown and has arranged 
        for the families to interview Russians involved in the incident 
        or the search and rescue operations that followed;
            (C) President Yeltsin's Government has also cooperated fully 
        with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to 
        allow it to complete its investigation of the incident and has 
        provided numerous materials requested by the ICAO, including 
        radar data and so-called ``black boxes'', the digital flight 
        data and cockpit voice recorders from the flight;
            (D) the Export Administration Act of 1979 continues to state 
        that the United States should continue to object to exceptions 
        to the International Control List for the Union of Soviet 
        Socialist Republics in light of the KAL tragedy, even though the 
        ``no exceptions'' policy was rescinded by President Bush in 
        1990;
            (E) the Government of the United States is seeking 
        compensation from the Russian Government on behalf of the 
        families of the KAL victims, and the Congress expects the 
        Administration to continue to pursue issues related to the 
        shootdown, including that of compensation, with officials at the 
        highest level of the Russian Government; and
            (F) in view of the cooperation provided by President Yeltsin 
        and his government regarding the KAL incident and these other 
        developments, it is appropriate to remove such language from the 
        Export Administration Act of 1979.
        (2) Section 3(15) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 
    U.S.C. App. 2402(15)) is repealed.

              INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.

made available for the Ballistic Missile Defense Program may not be 
transferred (or made available for transfer) to Russia or any other 
independent state of the former Soviet Union by the United States (or 
with the consent of the United States) unless the President determines, 
and certifies to the Congress at least 15 days prior to any such 
transfer, that such transfer is in the national interest of the United 
States and is to be made for the purpose of maintaining peace.''.
    (2) Section 6 of that Act is amended by amending the item in the 
table of contents relating to section 223 to read as follows:
``Sec. 223. Limitation on transfer of certain military technology to 
          independent states of the former Soviet Union.''.
