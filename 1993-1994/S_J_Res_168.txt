                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
       Designating May 11, 1994, as ``Vietnam Human Rights Day''.

Whereas May 11, 1994, is the fourth anniversary of the issuance of the 
  Manifesto of the Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam;
Whereas the Manifesto, which calls upon Hanoi to respect basic human 
  rights, accept a multiparty system, and restore the right of the 
  Vietnamese people to choose their own form of government through free 
  and fair elections, reflects the will and aspirations of the people 
  of Vietnam;
Whereas the author of the Manifesto and thousands of innocent 
  Vietnamese, including religious leaders, are imprisoned by the 
  Socialist Republic of Vietnam because of their nonviolent struggle 
  for freedom and human rights;
Whereas the leaders of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are seeking to 
  expand diplomatic and trade relations with the rest of the world;
Whereas the United States, as the leader of the free world, has a 
  special responsibility to safeguard freedom and promote the 
  protection of human rights throughout the world; and
Whereas the Congress urges Hanoi to release immediately and 
  unconditionally all political prisoners, with full restoration of 
  their civil and human rights; guarantee equal protection under the 
  law to all Vietnamese, regardless of religious belief, political 
  philosophy, or previous associations; restore all basic human rights, 
  such as freedom of speech, religion, movement, and association; 
  abolish the single party system and permit the functioning of all 
  political organizations without intimidation or harassment and 
  announce a framework and timetable for free and fair election under 
  the sponsorship of the United Nations that will allow the Vietnamese 
  people to choose their own form of government: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That May 11, 1994, is 
designated as ``Vietnam Human Rights Day'' in support
of efforts by the Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam to 
achieve freedom and human rights for the people of Vietnam, and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to commemorate such day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.
