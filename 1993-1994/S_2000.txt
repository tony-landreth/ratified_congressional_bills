SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING APPROPRIATIONS FOR LIHEAP.

    (a) Findings._Congress finds the following:
        (1) Seventy-seven percent of the over 25 million households 
    that were eligible for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance 
    Program (hereinafter referred to as ``LIHEAP'') in fiscal year 1992 
    did not receive assistance due to a lack of funds.
        (2) Recent economic distress has caused significant 
    unemployment, which has resulted in a greater need for energy 
    assistance than ever before.
        (3) More than 66 percent of LIHEAP household recipients have an 
    annual income that is below the poverty level.
        (4) Forty-three percent of all LIHEAP eligible households 
    include children.
        (5) LIHEAP eligible households with children spend 
    approximately 16 percent of their annual incomes on home energy 
    costs, which is more than 4 times greater than that paid by the 
    average household in the United States, and far beyond their means.
        (6) Approximately 40 percent of LIHEAP household recipients are 
    comprised of elderly or disabled persons.
        (7) Congress appropriated $1,475,000,000 for LIHEAP for fiscal 
    year 1995.
        (8) The Department of Energy predicts that the costs of 
    residential fuels will increase at a pace greater than inflation.
    (b) Sense of the Congress._It is the sense of the Congress that_
        (1) the maintenance of LIHEAP should be a high priority in 
    order to enable low-income households, especially the working poor, 
    the disabled, and the low-income elderly, who all depend on LIHEAP, 
    to meet their energy costs and needs;
        (2) all appropriations made for LIHEAP for fiscal year 1995 
    should be expended; and
        (3) expenditures for LIHEAP for fiscal year 1996 should ensure 
    the provision of services at the level provided in fiscal year 
    1995.

SEC. 314. EFFECTIVE DATE.
