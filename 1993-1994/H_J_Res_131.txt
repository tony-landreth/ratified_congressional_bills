                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating December 7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day''.

Whereas, on December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Air Force 
  attacked units of the armed forces of the United States stationed at 
  Pearl Harbor, Hawaii;
Whereas more than 2,000 citizens of the United States were killed and 
  more than 1,000 citizens of the United States were wounded in the 
  attack on Pearl Harbor;
Whereas the attack on Pearl Harbor marked the entry of the United 
  States into World War II;
Whereas the veterans of World War II and all other people of the United 
  States commemorate December 7 in remembrance of the attack on Pearl 
  Harbor; and
Whereas commemoration of the attack on Pearl Harbor will instill in all 
  people of the United States a greater understanding and appreciation 
  of the selfless sacrifice of the individuals who served in the armed 
  forces of the United States during World War II: Now, therefore, be 
  it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That December 7 of each year 
is designated as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day'' and the 
President is authorized and requested--
        (1) to issue annually a proclamation calling on the people of 
    the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies 
    and activities; and
        (2) to urge all Federal agencies, and interested organizations, 
    groups, and individuals, to fly the flag of the United States at 
    halfstaff each December 7 in honor of the individuals who died as a 
    result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
