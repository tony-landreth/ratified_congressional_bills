                                 An Act

  
 
  To provide for the establishment of strategic planning and performance 
measurement

           in the Federal Government, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Government Performance and Results 
Act of 1993''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
        (1) waste and inefficiency in Federal programs undermine the 
    confidence of the American people in the Government and reduces the 
    Federal Government's ability to address adequately vital public 
    needs;
        (2) Federal managers are seriously disadvantaged in their 
    efforts to improve program efficiency and effectiveness, because of 
    insufficient articulation of program goals and inadequate 
    information on program performance; and
        (3) congressional policymaking, spending decisions and program 
    oversight are seriously handicapped by insufficient attention to 
    program performance and results.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
        (1) improve the confidence of the American people in the 
    capability of the Federal Government, by systematically holding 
    Federal agencies accountable for achieving program results;
        (2) initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot 
    projects in setting program goals, measuring program performance 
    against those goals, and reporting publicly on their progress;
        (3) improve Federal program effectiveness and public 
    accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service quality, 
    and customer satisfaction;
        (4) help Federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring 
    that they plan for meeting program objectives and by providing them 
    with information about program results and service quality;
        (5) improve congressional decisionmaking by providing more 
    objective information on achieving statutory objectives, and on the 
    relative effectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs and 
    spending; and
        (6) improve internal management of the Federal Government.

anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater managerial or 
organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority, and shall

endorsement included in the proposing agency's performance plan.

prepared under section 1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a 
waiver of limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made 
permanent.
