        H.J.Res. 415

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating the week beginning October 16, 1994, as ``National Penny 
Charity Week''.

Whereas 170 billion pennies--$1.7 billion--are circulating in the 
  economy;
Whereas financial institutions, merchants, and retail establishments 
  are reporting a shortage of pennies;
Whereas this shortage is a result of American people hoarding their 
  pennies;
Whereas, during fiscal year 1994, the United States Mint will spend 
  $1.64 million to produce 13.3 billion pennies in order to counter the 
  effect of hoarding;
Whereas donating hoarded pennies to charities provides the charities 
  with funds, diminishes the shortage of pennies, lowers the demand on 
  the United States Mint to produce additional pennies, and ultimately 
  saves the United States Treasury money;
Whereas Penny Lover's of America is a not-for-profit charitable 
  organization that seeks to promote character, scholarship, and 
  patriotism among America's youth by collecting penny donations to 
  finance their educational pursuits;
Whereas Penny Lover's of America is celebrating its 10th anniversary 
  this year by conducting a penny recycling campaign; and
Whereas ``National Penny Charity Week'' coincides with Penny Lover's of 
  America's ``National Penny Campaign Recycling Project'' both of which 
  will assist in alleviating the penny shortage and raise funds for 
  charitable and community causes: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating the week 
of October 16, 1994, as ``National Penny Charity Week'' and to call on 
the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities, including the donation of pennies to 
charities, particularly to those which provide direct services to the 
Nation's underprivileged and disadvantaged population, and to worthy 
community causes.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
