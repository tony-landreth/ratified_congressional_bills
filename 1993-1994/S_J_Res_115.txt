        S.J.Res. 115
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating November 22, 1993, as ``National Military Families 
Recognition Day''.

Whereas the Congress recognizes and supports the Department of Defense 
  policies to recruit, train, equip, retain, and field a military force 
  that is capable of preserving peace and protecting the vital interests 
  of the United States and its allies;
Whereas military families shoulder the responsibility of providing 
  emotional support for their service members;
Whereas, in times of war and military action, military families have 
  demonstrated their patriotism through their steadfast support and 
  commitment to the Nation;
Whereas the emotional and mental readiness of the United States military 
  personnel around the world is tied to the well-being and satisfaction 
  of their families;
Whereas the quality of life that the Armed Forces provide to military 
  families is a key factor in the retention of military personnel;
Whereas the people of the United States are truly indebted to military 
  families for facing adversities, including extended separations from 
  their service members, frequent household moves due to reassignments, 
  and restrictions on their employment and educational opportunities;
Whereas 74 percent of officers and 55 percent of enlisted personnel in 
  the Armed Forces are married;
Whereas families of active duty military personnel (including 
  individuals other than spouses and children) comprise more than one-
  half of the active duty community of the Armed Forces, and spouses and 
  children of members of the reserve component of the Armed Forces in 
  paid status comprise more than one-half of the individuals 
  constituting the reserve component of the Armed Forces community;
Whereas hundreds of thousands of spouses, children, and other dependents 
  living abroad with members of the Armed Forces face financial hardship 
  and feelings of cultural isolation;
Whereas the significantly reduced global military tensions following the 
  end of the Cold War have resulted in a down-sizing of the national 
  defense and a refocusing of national priorities on strengthening the 
  American economy and increasing competitiveness in the global 
  marketplace;
Whereas the Congress is grateful for the sacrifices of military families 
  and is committed to assisting the service members and their families 
  who undergo the transition from active duty to civilian life; and
Whereas military families are devoted to the overall mission of the 
  Department of Defense and have supported the role of the United States 
  as the military leader and protector of the Free World: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That November 22, 1993 is 
designated as ``National Military Families Recognition Day'' in 
appreciation of the commitment and devotion of present and former 
military families and the sacrifices that such families have made on 
behalf of the Nation and the President is authorized and requested to 
issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to 
observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
