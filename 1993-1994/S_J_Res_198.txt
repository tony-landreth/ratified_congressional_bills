  Designating 1995 the ``Year of the Grandparent''.

Whereas grandparents bring a tremendous amount of love and power for 
  good into the lives of their grandchildren;
Whereas grandparents, in partnership with parents, help deepen every 
  child's roots and strengthen every child's wings so that every child 
  may soar into adulthood with a glad heart and a confident spirit;
Whereas grandparents are a strong and important voice in support of the 
  happiness and well-being of children;
Whereas grandparents often serve as the primary caregivers for their 
  grandchildren, providing a stable and supportive home environment;
Whereas grandparents should be acknowledged for the important role they 
  play within families, and for the many and varied contributions they 
  make to enhance and further the value of the family and family 
  traditions;
Whereas public awareness of and appreciation for the contributions of 
  grandparents should be strengthened;
Whereas grandparents should be encouraged to continue as a vital force 
  in the shaping of American families today and into the future;
Whereas the Nation acknowledges the contributions of grandparents by 
  celebrating National Grandparents Day each September; and
Whereas there should be a year-long national celebration of 
  grandparents and grandparenting: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That 1995 is designated the 
``Year of the Grandparent'', and the President is

of the United States to observe that year with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
