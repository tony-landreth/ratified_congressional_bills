                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating October 16, 1993, and October 16, 1994, each as World Food 
Day.

Whereas hunger and malnutrition remain daily facts of life for hundreds 
  of millions of people in the world;
Whereas the children of the world suffer the most serious effects of 
  hunger and malnutrition, with millions of children dying each year 
  from hunger-related illness and disease, and many others suffering 
  permanent physical or mental impairment because of vitamin or protein 
  deficiencies;
Whereas the United States has a long tradition of demonstrating 
  humanitarian concern for the hungry and malnourished people of the 
  world;
Whereas there is growing concern in the United States and in other 
  countries for environmental protection and the dangers posed to future 
  food supply from misuse and overuse of land and water, loss of 
  biological diversity and erosion of genetic resources on a global 
  scale;
Whereas the world community increasingly calls upon the United States to 
  resolve food problems stemming from local conflicts and civil unrest--
  such as in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia--calling for the use of 
  peacekeeping forces as well as the provision of emergency food 
  supplies;
Whereas the United States plays a major role in the development and 
  implementation of interregional food and agricultural trade standards 
  and practices, and recognizes the positive role that food trade can 
  play in enhancing human nutrition and in the alleviation of hunger;
Whereas although progress has been made in reducing the incidence of 
  hunger and malnutrition in the United States, certain groups, notably 
  Native Americans, migrant workers, the elderly, the homeless, and 
  children, remain vulnerable to malnutrition and related diseases;
Whereas our Government is now preparing a National Plan of Action for 
  nutrition wellbeing in accordance with the commitment made at the 
  recent International Conference on Nutrition;
Whereas the conservation of natural resources, the preservation of 
  biological diversity and strong public and private programs of 
  agricultural research are required for the United States to remain the 
  largest surplus food producer in the world and to continue to aid the 
  hungry and malnourished people of the world;
Whereas the United States is and must remain the world leader in the 
  development of biotechnology aimed at enhancing the improved 
  production, safety and quality of the world food supply;
Whereas the Congress of the United States is aware of and strongly 
  supports plans and preparations for the International Conference on 
  Plant Genetic Resources planned for 1995;
Whereas participation by private voluntary organizations and businesses, 
  working with national governments and the international community, is 
  essential in the search for ways to increase food production in 
  developing countries and improve food distribution to hungry and 
  malnourished people;
Whereas the member nations of the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
  the United Nations unanimously designated October 16 of each year as 
  World Food Day because of the need to increase public awareness of 
  world hunger problems;
Whereas past observances of World Food Day have been supported by 
  proclamations by the Congress, the President, the 50 States, the 
  District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
  territories and possessions of the United States, and by programs of 
  the Department of Agriculture, other Federal departments and agencies, 
  and the governments and peoples of more than 150 other nations;
Whereas 450 private voluntary organizations and thousands of community 
  leaders are participating in the planning of World Food Day 
  observances in 1993, and a growing number of these organizations and 
  leaders are using this day as a focal point for year-round programs; 
  and
Whereas the people of the United States can express their concern for 
  the plight of the hungry and malnourished people throughout the world 
  by study and action and by fasting and donating food and money: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That October 16, 1993, and 
October 16, 1994, are each designated as ``World Food Day'', and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe World Food Day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities, including worship services, 
fasting, education endeavors, and the establishment of year-around food 
and health programs and policies.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
