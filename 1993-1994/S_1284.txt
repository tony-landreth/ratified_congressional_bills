    ``(a) Findings._The Congress finds that_
        ``(1) in 1993 there are more than 3,000,000 individuals with 
    developmental disabilities in the United States;
        ``(2) disability is a natural part of the human experience that 
    does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental 
    disabilities to enjoy the opportunity to live independently, enjoy 
    self-determination, make choices, contribute to society, and 
    experience full integration and inclusion in the economic, 
    political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American 
    society;
        ``(3) individuals with developmental disabilities continually 
    encounter various forms of discrimination in critical areas;
        ``(4) there is a lack of public awareness of the capabilities 
    and competencies of individuals with developmental disabilities;
        ``(5) individuals whose disabilities occur during their 
    developmental period frequently have severe disabilities that are 
    likely to continue indefinitely;
        ``(6) individuals with developmental disabilities often require 
    lifelong specialized services and assistance, provided in a 
    coordinated and culturally competent manner by many agencies, 
    professionals, advocates, community representatives, and others to 
    eliminate barriers and to meet the needs of such individuals and 
    their families;
        ``(7) a substantial portion of individuals with developmental 
    disabilities and their families do not have access to appropriate 
    support and services from generic and specialized service systems 
    and remain unserved or underserved;
        ``(8) family members, friends, and members of the community can 
    play an important role in enhancing the lives of individuals with 
    developmental disabilities, especially when the family and 
    community are provided with the necessary services and supports;
        ``(9) there is a need to ensure that services, supports, and 
    other assistance are provided in a culturally competent manner, 
    that individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds are 
    fully included in all activities under this Act, and that greater 
    efforts are made to recruit individuals from minority backgrounds 
    into the field of developmental disabilities; and
        ``(10) the goals of the Nation properly include the goal of 
    providing individuals with developmental disabilities with the 
    opportunities and support to_
            ``(A) make informed choices and decisions;
            ``(B) live in homes and communities in which such 
        individuals can exercise their full rights and responsibilities 
        as citizens;
            ``(C) pursue meaningful and productive lives;
            ``(D) contribute to their family, community, State, and 
        Nation;
            ``(E) have interdependent friendships and relationships 
        with others; and
            ``(F) achieve full integration and inclusion in society, in 
        an individualized manner, consistent with unique strengths, 
        resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of 
        each individual.
    ``(b) Purpose._The purpose of this Act is to assure that 
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families 
participate in the design of and have access to culturally competent 
services, supports, and other assistance and opportunities that promote 
independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion into the 
community, through_
        ``(1) support to State Developmental Disabilities Councils in 
    each State to promote, through systemic change, capacity building, 
    and advocacy activities that are consistent with the policy under 
    subsection (c)(2), a consumer and family-centered, comprehensive 
    system, and a coordinated array of services, supports, and other 
    assistance for individuals with developmental disabilities and 
    their families;
        ``(2) support to protection and advocacy systems in each State 
    to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with 
    developmental disabilities;
        ``(3) support to university affiliated programs to provide 
    interdisciplinary preservice preparation of students and fellows, 
    community service activities, and the dissemination of information 
    and research findings; and
        ``(4) support to national initiatives to collect necessary 
    data, provide technical assistance to State Developmental 
    Disabilities Councils, protection and advocacy systems and 
    university affiliated programs, and support other nationally 
    significant activities.
    ``(c) Policy._It is the policy of the United States that all 
programs, projects, and activities receiving assistance under this Act 
shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the principles that_
        ``(1) individuals with developmental disabilities, including 
    those with the most severe developmental disabilities, are capable 
    of achieving independence, productivity, and integration and 
    inclusion into the community, and often require the provision of 
    services, supports and other assistance to achieve independence, 
    productivity, and integration and inclusion;
        ``(2) individuals with developmental disabilities and their 
    families have competencies, capabilities and personal goals that 
    should be recognized, supported, and encouraged, and any assistance 
    to such individuals should be provided in an individualized manner, 
    consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, 
    concerns, abilities, and capabilities of such individuals;
        ``(3) individuals with developmental disabilities and their 
    families are the primary decisionmakers regarding the services and 
    supports such individuals and their families receive and play 
    decisionmaking roles in policies and programs that affect the lives 
    of such individuals and their families;
        ``(4) services, supports, and other assistance are provided in 
    a manner that demonstrates respect for individual dignity, personal 
    preferences, and cultural differences;
        ``(5) specific efforts must be made to ensure that individuals 
    from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds enjoy effective and 
    meaningful opportunities for full participation in the 
    developmental disabilities service system;
        ``(6) recruitment efforts within developmental disabilities at 
    the level of preservice training, community training, practice, 
    administration and policymaking must focus on bringing larger 
    numbers of racial and ethnic minorities into the field in order to 
    provide appropriate skills, knowledge, role models, and sufficient 
    manpower to address the growing needs of an increasingly diverse 
    population;
        ``(7) with education and support, communities can be responsive 
    to the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and 
    their families and are enriched by the full and active 
    participation and the contributions by individuals with 
    developmental disabilities and their families; and
        ``(8) individuals with developmental disabilities should have 
    access to opportunities and the necessary support to be included in 
    community life, have interdependent relationships, live in homes 
    and communities, and make contributions to their families, 
    community, State, and Nation.''.
