        S.J.Res. 178

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To proclaim the week of October 16 through October 22, 1994, as 
``National Character Counts Week''.

Whereas young people will be the stewards of our communities, Nation, 
  and world in critical times, and the present and future well-being of 
  our society requires an involved, caring citizenry with good 
  character;
Whereas concerns about the character training of children have taken on 
  a new sense of urgency as violence by and against youth threatens the 
  physical and psychological well-being of the Nation;
Whereas more than ever, children need strong and constructive guidance 
  from their families and their communities, including schools, youth 
  organizations, religious institutions and civic groups;
Whereas the character of a Nation is only as strong as the character of 
  its individual citizens;
Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are taught the 
  importance of good character, and that character counts in personal 
  relationships, in school, and in the workplace;
Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not automatically 
  develop good character and, therefore, conscientious efforts must be 
  made by youth-influencing institutions and individuals to help young 
  people develop the essential traits and characteristics that comprise 
  good character;
Whereas character development is, first and foremost, an obligation of 
  families, efforts by faith communities, schools, and youth, civic and 
  human service organizations also play a very important role in 
  supporting family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;
Whereas the Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, youth and 
  community leaders to recognize the valuable role our youth play in 
  the present and future of our Nation, and to recognize that character 
  is an important part of that future;
Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by an eminent 
  group of educators, youth leaders and ethics scholars for the purpose 
  of articulating a coherent framework for character education 
  appropriate to a diverse and pluralistic society;
Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``Effective character 
  education is based on core ethical values which form the foundation 
  of democratic society'';
Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen Declaration 
  constitute the Six Core Elements of Character;
Whereas these Six Core Elements of Character are--
        (1) trustworthiness;
        (2) respect;
        (3) responsibility;
        (4) justice and fairness;
        (5) caring; and
        (6) civic virtue and citizenship.
Whereas these Six Core Elements of Character transcend cultural, 
  religious, and socioeconomic differences;
Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``The character and conduct 
  of our youth reflect the character and conduct of society; therefore, 
  every adult has the responsibility to teach and model the core 
  ethical values and every social institution has the responsibility to 
  promote the development of good character.'';
Whereas the Congress encourages individuals and organizations, 
  especially those who have an interest in the education and training 
  of our youth, to adopt these Six Core Elements of Character as 
  intrinsic to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society 
  as a whole; and
Whereas the Congress encourages communities, especially schools and 
  youth organizations, to integrate these Six Core Elements of 
  Character into programs serving students and children: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 16 
through October 22, 1994, is designated as ``National Character Counts 
Week'', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the United States and 
interested groups to embrace these Six Core Elements of Character and 
to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
