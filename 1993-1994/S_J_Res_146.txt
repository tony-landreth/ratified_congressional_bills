        S.J.Res. 146

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
  Designating May 1, 1994, through May 7, 1994, as ``National Walking 
                                 Week''.

Whereas medical authorities have established that walking_
        (1) powerfully protects against high blood pressure, 
    cholesterol problems, and other factors that can contribute to 
    heart disease;
        (2) protects against adult onset (Type II) diabetes;
        (3) builds strong bones and protects against osteoporosis, the 
    weak-bone disease that afflicts millions of older women;
        (4) probably offers protection against several forms of cancer 
    that are believed to be preventable through regular and moderate 
    exercise; and
        (5) is a safe and dependable way for millions of overweight 
    people to lose weight without stringent dieting;
Whereas the failure to exercise regularly, such as walking, has been 
  identified as the single greatest risk factor for heart disease;
Whereas the designation of ``National Walking Week'' will help promote 
  the issue of pedestrian access and safety;
Whereas areas of America are becoming inaccessible or unsafe for 
  walkers, so the benefits of this activity are being blocked;
Whereas people should be able to walk anywhere in their community, 
  within reason; and
Whereas walking encourages community spirit and safety: Now, therefore, 
  be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That May 1, 1994, through May 
7, 1994, is designated as ``National Walking Week''. The President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the 
people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
