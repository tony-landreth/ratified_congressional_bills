        S.J.Res. 22
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  Designating March 25, 1993, as ``Greek Independence Day: A National 
Day of

             Celebration of Greek and American Democracy''.

Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which 
  the supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew 
  heavily upon the political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece 
  in forming our representative democracy;
Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond between our two 
  nations and their peoples;
Whereas March 25, 1993, marks the one hundred and seventy-second 
  anniversary of the beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek 
  people from the Ottoman Empire; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people, 
  and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which our two great 
  nations were born: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1993, is 
designated as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of 
Greek and American Democracy''. The President is authorized and 
requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United 
States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
