            consult with an appropriate group of representatives of the 
            States concerned, as determined by those States.
                (iii) The Trade Representative shall make every effort 
            to ensure that the State concerned is involved in the 
            development of the position of the United States at each 
            stage of the consultations and each subsequent stage of 
            dispute settlement proceedings regarding the matter. In 
            particular, the Trade Representative shall--

                    (I) notify the State concerned not later than 7 
                days after a WTO member requests the establishment of a 
                dispute settlement panel or gives notice of the WTO 
                member's decision to appeal a report by a dispute 
                settlement panel regarding the matter; and
                    (II) provide the State concerned with the 
                opportunity to advise and assist the Trade 
                Representative in the preparation of factual 
                information and argumentation for any written or oral 
                presentations by the United States in consultations or 
                in proceedings of a panel or the Appellate Body 
                regarding the matter.

                (iv) If a dispute settlement panel or the Appellate 
            Body finds that the law of a State is inconsistent with any 
            of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the Trade Representative 
            shall consult with the State concerned in an effort to 
            develop a mutually agreeable response to the report of the 
            panel or the Appellate Body and shall make every effort to 
            ensure that the State concerned is involved in the 
            development of the United States position regarding the 
            response.
            (D) Notice to states regarding consultations on foreign 
        subcentral government laws.--
                (i) Subject to clause (ii), the Trade Representative 
            shall, at least 30 days before making a request for 
            consultations under Article 4 of the Dispute Settlement 
            Understanding regarding a subcentral government measure of 
            another WTO member, notify, and solicit the views of, 
            appropriate representatives of each State regarding the 
            matter.
                (ii) In exigent circumstances clause (i) shall not 
            apply, in which case the Trade Representative shall notify 
            the appropriate representatives of each State not later 
            than 3 days after making the request for consultations 
            referred to in clause (i).
        (2) Legal challenge.--
            (A) In general.--No State law, or the application of such a 
        State law, may be declared invalid as to any person or 
        circumstance on the ground that the provision or application is 
        inconsistent with any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, except 
        in an action brought by the United States for the purpose of 
        declaring such law or application invalid.
            (B) Procedures governing action.--In any action described 
        in subparagraph (A) that is brought by the United States

            Appellate Body convened under the Dispute Settlement 
            Understanding regarding the State law, or the law of any 
            political subdivision thereof, shall not be considered as 
            binding or otherwise accorded deference;
                (ii) the United States shall have the burden of proving 
            that the law that is the subject of the action, or the 
            application of that law, is inconsistent with the agreement 
            in question;
                (iii) any State whose interests may be impaired or 
            impeded in the action shall have the unconditional right to 
            intervene in the action as a party, and the United States 
            shall be entitled to amend its complaint to include a claim 
            or cross-claim concerning the law of a State that so 
            intervenes; and
                (iv) any State law that is declared invalid shall not 
            be deemed to have been invalid in its application during 
            any period before the court's judgment becomes final and 
            all timely appeals, including discretionary review, of such 
            judgment are exhausted.
            (C) Reports to congressional committees.--At least 30 days 
        before the United States brings an action described in

        report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate--
                (i) describing the proposed action;
                (ii) describing efforts by the Trade Representative to 
            resolve the matter with the State concerned by other means; 
            and
                (iii) if the State law was the subject of consultations 
            under the Dispute Settlement Understanding, certifying that 
            the Trade Representative has substantially complied with 
            the requirements of paragraph (1)(C) in connection with the 
            matter.
    Following the submission of the report, and before the action is 
    brought, the Trade Representative shall consult with the committees 
    referred to in the preceding sentence concerning the matter.

        (1) In general.--Whenever the HTS column 1 general rates of 
    duty for 2 or more 8-digit subheadings are at the same level and 
    such subheadings are subordinate to a provision required by the 
    International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description

    consultation and layover requirements of section 115, that the 
    goods described in such subheadings be provided for in a single 8-
    digit subheading of the HTS, and that--
            (A) the HTS column 1 general rate of duty for such single 
        subheading be the column 1 general rate of duty common to all 
        such subheadings, and
            (B) the HTS column 2 rate of duty for such single 
        subheading be the highest column 2 rate of duty for such 
        subheadings that is in effect on the day before the effective 
        date of such proclamation.
        (2) Same level of duty.--The provisions of this subsection 
    apply to subheadings described in paragraph (1) that have the same 
    column 1 general rate of duty--
            (A) on the date of the enactment of this Act, or
            (B) after such date of enactment as a result of a staged 
        reduction in such column 1 rates of duty.

    appropriate commodity classifications of the Harmonized Tariff 
    Schedule of the United States upon first entry into the United 
    States of each such spare part purchased in, or imported from, a

SEC. 129. ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION FOLLOWING WTO PANEL REPORTS.

    (a) Action by United States International Trade Commission.--
        (1) Advisory report.--If a dispute settlement panel finds in an 
    interim report under Article 15 of the Dispute Settlement 
    Understanding, or the Appellate Body finds in a report under 
    Article 17 of that Understanding, that an action by the 
    International Trade Commission in connection with a particular 
    proceeding is not in conformity with the obligations of the United 
    States under the Antidumping Agreement, the Safeguards Agreement, 
    or the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the 
    Trade Representative may request the Commission to issue an 
    advisory report on whether title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 or 
    title II of the Trade Act of 1974, as the case may be, permits the 
    Commission to take steps in connection with the particular 
    proceeding that would render its action not inconsistent with the 
    findings of the panel or the Appellate Body concerning those 
    obligations. The Trade Representative shall notify the 
    congressional committees of such request.
        (2) Time limits for report.--The Commission shall transmit its 
    report under paragraph (1) to the Trade Repre-sentative--
            (A) in the case of an interim report described in paragraph

        requests the report; and
            (B) in the case of a report of the Appellate Body, within 
        21 calendar days after the Trade Representative requests the 
        report.
        (3) Consultations on request for commission determination.--If 
    a majority of the Commissioners issues an affirmative report under 
    paragraph (1), the Trade Representative shall consult with the 
    congressional committees concerning the matter.
        (4) Commission determination.--Notwithstanding any provision of 
    the Tariff Act of 1930 or title II of the Trade Act of 1974, if a 
    majority of the Commissioners issues an affirmative report under 
    paragraph (1), the Commission, upon the written request of the 
    Trade Representative, shall issue a determination in connection 
    with the particular proceeding that would render the Commission's 
    action described in paragraph (1) not inconsistent with the 
    findings of the panel or Appellate Body. The Commission shall issue 
    its determination not later than 120 days after the request from 
    the Trade Representative is made.
        (5) Consultations on implementation of commission 
    determination.--The Trade Representative shall consult with the 
    congressional committees before the Commission's determination 
    under paragraph (4) is implemented.

            under this subparagraph within 180 days after the date on 
            which the review is initiated, and a final determination 
            within 90 days after the date the preliminary determination 
            is issued, except that if the administering authority 
            concludes that the case is extraordinarily complicated, it 
            may extend the 180-day period to 300 days and may extend 
            the 90-day period to 150 days.

        administering authority shall make a preliminary determination 
        under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) within 245 
        days after the last day of the month in which occurs the 
        anniversary of the date of publication of the order, finding, 
        or suspension agreement for which the review under paragraph 
        (1) is requested, and a final determination under paragraph (1) 
        within 120 days after the date on which the preliminary

        complete the review within the foregoing time, the 
        administering authority may extend that 245-day period to 365 
        days and may extend that 120-day period to 180 days. The 
        administering authority may extend the time for making a final 
        determination without extending the time for making a 
        preliminary determination, if such final determination is made 
        not later than 300 days after the date on which the preliminary 
        determination is published.

        review under paragraph (1), such liquidation shall be made 
        promptly and, to the greatest extent practicable, within 90 
        days after the instructions to Customs are issued. In any case 
        in which liquidation has not occurred within that 90-day 
        period, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the request 
        of the affected party, provide an explanation thereof.

        case in which a final determination under paragraph (1) is 
        under review under section 516A and a liquidation of entries 
        covered by the determination is enjoined under section 
        516A(c)(2) or suspended under section 516A(g)(5)(C), the 
        administering authority shall, within 10 days after the final 
        disposition of the review under section 516A, transmit to the 
        Federal Register for publication the final disposition and 
        issue instructions to the Customs Service with respect to the 
        liquidation of entries pursuant to the review. In such a case, 
        the 90-day period referred to in subparagraph (B) shall begin 
        on the day on which the administering authority issues such 
        instructions.

    under this subsection initiated 2 years or 4 years after the 
    publication of an antidumping duty order under section 736(a), the 
    administering authority, if requested, shall determine whether 
    antidumping duties have been absorbed by a foreign producer or 
    exporter subject to the order if the subject merchandise is sold in 
    the United States through an importer who is affiliated with such 
    foreign producer or exporter. The administering authority shall 
    notify the Commission of its findings regarding such duty 
    absorption for the Commission to consider in conducting a review 
    under subsection (c).
    ``(b) Reviews Based on Changed Circumstances.--
        ``(1) In general.--Whenever the administering authority or the

        antidumping duty order under this title or a finding under the 
        Antidumping Act, 1921, or in a countervailing duty order under 
        this title or section 303,

        investigation continued pursuant to section 704(g) or 734(g),
    which shows changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review of 
    such determination or agreement, the administering authority or the 
    Commission (as the case may be) shall conduct a review of the 
    determination or agreement after publishing notice of the review in 
    the Federal Register.

    subsection, the Commission shall--

        injurious effects of imports of the subject merchandise, and
            ``(C) in the case of an affirmative determination resulting 
        from an investigation continued under section 704(g) or 734(g),

        injury.

    Commission under this subsection--

        investigation or a suspension agreement shall have the burden

    cause shown--

        under section 705(b) or 735(b), or an investigation suspended

        countervailing duty order to which subparagraph (B) applies or 
        which was issued without an affirmative determination of injury 
        by the Commission under section 303), an antidumping duty 
        order, or a notice of suspension of an investigation, described 
        in subsection (a)(1),

        with respect to a countervailing duty order, or
            ``(C) a determination under this section to continue an 
        order or suspension agreement,
    the administering authority and the Commission shall conduct a 
    review to determine, in accordance with section 752, whether 
    revocation of the countervailing or antidumping duty order or 
    termination of the investigation suspended under section 704 or 734 
    would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or 
    a countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) and of material 
    injury.
        ``(2) Notice of initiation of review.--Not later than 30 days 
    before the fifth anniversary of the date described in paragraph 
    (1), the administering authority shall publish in the Federal 
    Register a notice of initiation of a review under this subsection 
    and request that interested parties submit--
            ``(A) a statement expressing their willingness to 
        participate in the review by providing information requested by 
        the administering authority and the Commission,

        revocation of the order or termination of the suspended 
        investigation, and

        administering authority or the Commission may specify.

            ``(A) No response.--If no interested party responds to the 
        notice of initiation under this subsection, the administering 
        authority shall issue a final determination, within 90 days 
        after the initiation of a review, revoking the order or 
        terminating the suspended investigation to which such notice 
        relates. For purposes of this paragraph, an interested party 
        means a party described in section 771(9) (C), (D), (E), (F), 
        or (G).

        of the review, or the Commission, within 150 days after such 
        initiation, may issue, without further investigation, a final 
        determination based on the facts available, in accordance with 
        section 776.

        771(9) (A) or (B) may elect not to participate in a review 
        conducted by the administering authority under this subsection 
        and to participate only in the review conducted by the 
        Commission under this subsection.
            ``(B) Effect of waiver.--In a review in which an interested 
        party waives its participation pursuant to this paragraph, the 
        administering authority shall conclude that revocation of the 
        order or termination of the investigation would be likely to 
        lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a 
        countervailable subsidy (as the case may be) with respect to 
        that interested party.
        ``(5) Conduct of review.--
            ``(A) Time limits for completion of review.--Unless the 
        review has been completed pursuant to paragraph (3) or 
        paragraph (4) applies, the administering authority shall make 
        its final determination pursuant to section 752 (b) or (c) 
        within 240 days after the date on which a review is initiated 
        under this subsection. If the administering authority makes a 
        final affirmative determination, the Commission shall make its 
        final determination pursuant to section 752(a) within 360 days 
        after the date on which a review is initiated under this 
        subsection.

        time for making their respective determinations under this 
        subsection by not more than 90 days, if the administering 
        authority or the Commission (as the case may be) determines 
        that the review is extraordinarily complicated. In a review in 
        which the administering authority extends the time for making a 
        final determination, but the Commission does not extend the 
        time for making a determination, the Commission's determination 
        shall be made not later than 120 days after the date on which 
        the final determination of the administering authority is 
        published.

        the case may be) may treat a review as extraordinarily 
        complicated if--
                ``(i) there is a large number of issues,

        with the administering authority, may group orders or suspended 
        investigations for review if it considers that such grouping is 
        appropriate and will promote administrative efficiency. Where 
        orders or suspended investigations have been grouped, the 
        Commission shall, subject to subparagraph (B), make its final 
        determination under this subsection not later than 120 days 
        after the date that the administering authority publishes 
        notice of its final determination with respect to the last

            such review is initiated. Reviews of all transition orders 
            shall be completed not later than 18 months after the 5th 
            anniversary of the date such orders are issued.

            in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be applied to all subsequent 
            5-year reviews of transition orders by substituting `date 
            of the determination to continue such orders' for `date 
            such orders are issued'.

        authority, in consultation with the Commission, shall determine 
        such sequence of review of transition orders as it deems 
        appropriate to promote administrative efficiency. To the extent 
        practicable, older orders shall be reviewed first.

        section, the term `transition order' means--

            finding under the Antidumping Act, 1921, or

            704 or 734,
        which is in effect on the date the WTO Agreement enters into 
        force with respect to the United States.
            ``(D) Issue date for transition orders.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, a transition order shall be treated as issued 
        on the date the WTO Agreement enters into force with respect to 
        the United States, if such order is based on an investigation 
        conducted by both the administering authority and the 
        Commission.
    ``(d) Revocation of Order or Finding; Termination of Suspended 
Investigation.--
        ``(1) In general.--The administering authority may revoke, in 
    whole or in part, a countervailing duty order or an antidumping 
    duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended investigation, 
    after review under subsection (a) or (b). The administering 
    authority shall not revoke, in whole or in part, a countervailing 
    duty order or terminate a suspended investigation on the basis of 
    any export taxes, duties, or other charges levied on the export of 
    the subject merchandise to the United States which are specifically 
    intended to offset the countervailable subsidy received.
        ``(2) Five-year reviews.--In the case of a review conducted 
    under subsection (c), the administering authority shall revoke a 
    countervailing duty order or an antidumping duty order or finding,

            ``(A) the administering authority makes a determination 
        that dumping or a countervailable subsidy, as the case may be, 
        would be likely to continue or recur, and

        injury would be likely to continue or recur as described in 
        section 752(a).

    determination under this section to revoke an order or finding or 
    terminate a suspended investigation shall apply with respect to 
    unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise which are entered, 
    or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date 
    determined by the administering authority.
    ``(e) Hearings.--Whenever the administering authority or the 
Commission conducts a review under this section, it shall, upon the 
request of an interested party, hold a hearing in accordance with 
section 774(b) in connection with that review.
    ``(f) Determination That Basis for Suspension No Longer Exists.--If 
the determination of the Commission under subsection (b)(2)(B) is 
negative, the suspension agreement shall be treated as not accepted, 
beginning on the date of publication of the Commission's determination, 
and the administering authority and the Commission shall proceed, under 
section 704(i) or 734(i), as if the suspension agreement had been 
violated on that date, except that no duty under any order subsequently 
issued shall be assessed on merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption before that date.
    ``(g) Correction of Ministerial Errors.--The administering 
authority shall establish procedures for the correction of ministerial 
errors in final determinations within a reasonable time after the 
determinations are issued under this section. Such procedures shall 
ensure opportunity for interested parties to present their views 
regarding any such errors. As used in this subsection, the term 
`ministerial error' includes errors in addition, subtraction, or other 
arithmetic function, clerical errors resulting from inaccurate copying, 
duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional error 
which the administering authority considers ministerial.''.

Material Injury.--
        ``(1) In general.--In a review conducted under section 751 (b) 
    or (c), the Commission shall determine whether revocation of an 
    order, or termination of a suspended investigation, would be likely 
    to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a 
    reasonably foreseeable time. The Commission shall consider the 
    likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject 
    merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked or the 
    suspended investigation is terminated. The Commission shall take 
    into account--
            ``(A) its prior injury determinations, including the 
        volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject 
        merchandise on the industry before the order was issued or the

        absorption under section 751(a)(4).
        ``(2) Volume.--In evaluating the likely volume of imports of 
    the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended 
    investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider whether 
    the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be 
    significant if the order is revoked or the suspended investigation 
    is terminated, either in absolute terms or relative to production 
    or consumption in the United States. In so doing, the Commission 
    shall consider all relevant economic factors, including--
            ``(A) any likely increase in production capacity or 
        existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,
            ``(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or 
        likely increases in inventories,
            ``(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such 
        merchandise into countries other than the United States, and
            ``(D) the potential for product-shifting if production 
        facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce 
        the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce 
        other products.
        ``(3) Price.--In evaluating the likely price effects of imports 
    of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked or the suspended 
    investigation is terminated, the Commission shall consider 
    whether--
            ``(A) there is likely to be significant price underselling 
        by imports of the subject merchandise as compared to domestic 
        like products, and
            ``(B) imports of the subject merchandise are likely to 
        enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a 
        significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of 
        domestic like products.
        ``(4) Impact on the industry.--In evaluating the likely impact 
    of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order 
    is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated, the 
    Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are 
    likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United 
    States, including, but not limited to--
            ``(A) likely declines in output, sales, market share, 
        profits, productivity, return on investments, and utilization 
        of capacity,
            ``(B) likely negative effects on cash flow, inventories, 
        employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital, and 
        investment, and
            ``(C) likely negative effects on the existing development 
        and production efforts of the industry, including efforts to 
        develop a derivative or more advanced version of the domestic 
        like product.
    The Commission shall evaluate all relevant economic factors 
    described in this paragraph within the context of the business 
    cycle and the conditions of competition that are distinctive to the 
    affected industry.
        ``(5) Basis for determination.--The presence or absence of any 
    factor which the Commission is required to consider under this 
    subsection shall not necessarily give decisive guidance with 
    respect to the Commission's determination of whether material 
    injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably 
    foreseeable time if the order is revoked or the suspended 
    investigation is terminated. In making that determination, the 
    Commission shall consider that the effects of revocation or 
    termination may not be imminent, but may manifest themselves only 
    over a longer period of time.
        ``(6) Magnitude of margin of dumping and net countervailable 
    subsidy; nature of countervailable subsidy.--In making a 
    determination under section 751 (b) or (c), the Commission may 
    consider the magnitude of the margin of dumping or the magnitude of 
    the net countervailable subsidy. If a countervailable subsidy is 
    involved the Commission shall consider information regarding the 
    nature of the countervailable subsidy and whether the subsidy is a 
    subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement.
        ``(7) Cumulation.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
    Commission may cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports 
    of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which 
    reviews under section 751 (b) or (c) were initiated on the same 
    day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and 
    with domestic like products in the United States market. The 
    Commission shall not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of 
    imports of the subject merchandise in a case in which it determines 
    that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact 
    on the domestic industry.
        ``(8) Special rule for regional industries.--In a review under 
    section 751 (b) or (c) involving a regional industry, the 
    Commission may base its determination on the regional industry 
    defined in the original investigation under this title, another 
    region that satisfies the criteria established in section 
    771(4)(C), or the United States as a whole. In determining if a 
    regional industry analysis is appropriate for the determination in 
    the review, the Commission shall consider whether the criteria 
    established in section 771(4)(C) are likely to be satisfied if the 
    order is revoked or the suspended investigation is terminated.
    ``(b) Determination of Likelihood of Continuation or Recurrence of 
a Countervailable Subsidy.--
        ``(1) In general.--In a review conducted under section 751(c), 
    the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of a 
    countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended 
    investigation under section 704 would be likely to lead to 
    continuation or recurrence of a countervailable subsidy. The 
    administering authority shall consider--
            ``(A) the net countervailable subsidy determined in the 
        investigation and subsequent reviews, and
            ``(B) whether any change in the program which gave rise to 
        the net countervailable subsidy described in subparagraph (A) 
        has occurred that is likely to affect that net countervailable 
        subsidy.
        ``(2) Consideration of other factors.--If good cause is shown, 
    the administering authority shall also consider--
            ``(A) programs determined to provide countervailable 
        subsidies in other investigations or reviews under this title, 
        but only to the extent that such programs--
                ``(i) can potentially be used by the exporters or 
            producers subject to the review under section 751(c), and
                ``(ii) did not exist at the time that the 
            countervailing duty order was issued or the suspension 
            agreement was accepted, and
            ``(B) programs newly alleged to provide countervailable 
        subsidies but only to the extent that the administering 
        authority makes an affirmative countervailing duty 
        determination with respect to such programs and with respect to 
        the exporters or producers subject to the review.
        ``(3) Net countervailable subsidy.--The administering authority 
    shall provide to the Commission the net countervailable subsidy 
    that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked or the suspended 
    investigation is terminated. The administering authority shall 
    normally choose a net countervailable subsidy that was determined 
    under section 705 or subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 751.
        ``(4) Special rule.--
            ``(A) Treatment of zero and de minimis rates.--A net 
        countervailable subsidy described in paragraph (1)(A) that is 
        zero or de minimis shall not by itself require the 
        administering authority to determine that revocation of a 
        countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended 
        investigation would not be likely to lead to continuation or 
        recurrence of a countervailable subsidy.
            ``(B) Application of de minimis standards.--For purposes of 
        this paragraph, the administering authority shall apply the de 
        minimis standards applicable to reviews conducted under 
        subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 751.
    ``(c) Determination of Likelihood of Continuation or Recurrence of 
Dumping.--
        ``(1) In general.--In a review conducted under section 751(c), 
    the administering authority shall determine whether revocation of 
    an antidumping duty order or termination of a suspended 
    investigation under section 734 would be likely to lead to 
    continuation or recurrence of sales of the subject merchandise at 
    less than fair value. The administering authority shall consider--
            ``(A) the weighted average dumping margins determined in 
        the investigation and subsequent reviews, and
            ``(B) the volume of imports of the subject merchandise for

        ``(3) Magnitude of the margin of dumping.--The administering 
    authority shall provide to the Commission the magnitude of the 
    margin of dumping that is likely to prevail if the order is revoked 
    or the suspended investigation is terminated. The administering 
    authority shall normally choose a margin that was determined under 
    section 735 or under subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 751.
        ``(4) Special rule.--
            ``(A) Treatment of zero or de minimis margins.--A dumping 
        margin described in paragraph (1)(A) that is zero or de minimis

    (b) Affirmative Determinations by Divided Commission.--Section 
771(11) (19 U.S.C. 1677(11)) is amended by inserting ``, including a 
determination under section 751,'' after ``determination by the 
Commission''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for title VII is 
amended by inserting after the item relating to section 751 the 
following:
``Sec. 752. Special rules for section 751(b) and 751(c) reviews.''.

SEC. 222. DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Industry.--
        (1) In general.--Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 771(4) 
    (19 U.S.C. 1677(4) (A) and (B)) are amended to read as follows:
            ``(A) In general.--The term `industry' means the producers 
        as a whole of a domestic like product, or those producers whose 
        collective output of a domestic like product constitutes a 
        major proportion of the total domestic production of the 
        product.
            ``(B) Related parties.--
                ``(i) If a producer of a domestic like product and an 
            exporter or importer of the subject merchandise are related 
            parties, or if a producer of the domestic like product is 
            also an importer of the subject merchandise, the producer 
            may, in appropriate circumstances, be excluded from the 
            industry.
                ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i), a producer and an 
            exporter or importer shall be considered to be related 
            parties, if--

                    ``(I) the producer directly or indirectly controls 
                the exporter or importer,
                    ``(II) the exporter or importer directly or 
                indirectly controls the producer,
                    ``(III) a third party directly or indirectly 
                controls the producer and the exporter or importer, or
                    ``(IV) the producer and the exporter or importer 
                directly or indirectly control a third party and there 
                is reason to believe that the relationship causes the 
                producer to act differently than a nonrelated producer.

            For purposes of this subparagraph, a party shall be 
            considered to directly or indirectly control another party 
            if the party is legally or operationally in a position to 
            exercise restraint or direction over the other party.''.
        (2) Regional industry.--Section 771(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 
    1677(4)(C)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
    sentence: ``The term `regional industry' means the domestic 
    producers within a region who are treated as a separate industry 
    under this subparagraph.''.
    (b) Impact on Affected Domestic Industry.--
        (1) In general.--Section 771(7)(C)(iii) (19 U.S.C. 
    1677(7)(C)(iii)) is amended--
            (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subclause (III), and
            (B) by striking the period at the end of subclause (IV) and 
        inserting ``, and

                    ``(V) in a proceeding under subtitle B, the 
                magnitude of the margin of dumping.''.

        (2) Captive production.--Section 771(7)(C) (19 U.S.C. 
    1677(7)(C)) is amended by striking clause (iv) and inserting the 
    following:
                ``(iv) Captive production.--If domestic producers 
            internally transfer significant production of the domestic 
            like product for the production of a downstream article and 
            sell significant production of the domestic like product in 
            the merchant market, and the Commission finds that--

                    ``(I) the domestic like product produced that is 
                internally transferred for processing into that 
                downstream article does not enter the merchant market 
                for the domestic like product,
                    ``(II) the domestic like product is the predominant 
                material input in the production of that downstream 
                article, and
                    ``(III) the production of the domestic like product 
                sold in the merchant market is not generally used in 
                the production of that downstream article,

            then the Commission, in determining market share and the 
            factors affecting financial performance set forth in clause 
            (iii), shall focus primarily on the merchant market for the 
            domestic like product.''.
        (3) Technical correction.--Section 771(7)(C)(iii) is amended by 
    striking ``subparagraph (B)(iii)'' and inserting ``subparagraph 
    (B)(i)(III)''.
    (c) Determination of Threat of Injury.--Clauses (i) and (ii) of 
section 771(7)(F) (19 U.S.C. 1677(7)(F) (i) and (ii)) are amended to 
read as follows:
                ``(i) In general.--In determining whether an industry 
            in the United States is threatened with material injury by 
            reason of imports (or sales for importation) of the subject 
            merchandise, the Commission shall consider, among other 
            relevant economic factors--

                    ``(I) if a countervailable subsidy is involved, 
                such information as may be presented to it by the

                (particularly as to whether the countervailable subsidy 
                is a subsidy described in Article 3 or 6.1 of the 
                Subsidies Agreement), and whether imports of the 
                subject merchandise are likely to increase,

                merchandise into the United States, taking into account 
                the availability of other export markets to absorb any

            conjecture or supposition.''.
    (d) Negligible Imports.--Section 771 (19 U.S.C. 1677) is amended--
        (1) in paragraph (7) by striking clause (v) of subparagraph 
    (C), and
        (2) by adding at the end the following:

SEC. 224. NORMAL VALUE.

    Section 773 (19 U.S.C. 1677b) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 773. NORMAL VALUE.

    ``(a) Determination.--In determining under this title whether 
subject merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than 
fair value, a fair comparison shall be made between the export price or 
constructed export price and normal value. In order to achieve a fair 
comparison with the export price or constructed export price, normal 
value shall be determined as follows:
        ``(1) Determination of normal value.--
            ``(A) In general.--The normal value of the subject 
        merchandise shall be the price described in subparagraph (B), 
        at a time reasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used 
        to determine the export price or constructed export price under 
        section 772(a) or (b).
            ``(B) Price.--The price referred to in subparagraph (A) 
        is--

            first sold (or, in the absence of a sale, offered for sale) 
            for consumption in the exporting country, in the usual 
            commercial quantities and in the ordinary course of trade 
            and, to the extent practicable, at the same level of trade 
            as the export price or constructed export price, or
                ``(ii) in a case to which subparagraph (C) applies, the 
            price at which the foreign like product is so sold (or 
            offered for sale) for consumption in a country other than 
            the exporting country or the United States, if--

                    ``(I) such price is representative,

                sold by the exporter or producer in such other country 
                is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or 
                value) of the subject merchandise sold in the United 
                States or for export to the United States, and

                other country prevents a proper comparison with the 
                export price or constructed export price.

            ``(C) Third country sales.--This subparagraph applies 
        when--
                ``(i) the foreign like product is not sold (or offered 
            for sale) for consumption in the exporting country as 
            described in subparagraph (B)(i),

            country is insufficient to permit a proper comparison with 
            the sales of the subject merchandise to the United States,

            exporting country does not permit a proper comparison with

        of the foreign like product sold in the exporting country shall 
        normally be considered to be insufficient if such quantity (or 
        value) is less than 5 percent of the aggregate quantity (or 
        value) of sales of the subject merchandise to the United 
        States.
        ``(2) Fictitious markets.--No pretended sale or offer for sale, 
    and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish a fictitious 
    market, shall be taken into account in determining normal value. 
    The occurrence of different movements in the prices at which 
    different forms of the foreign like product are sold (or, in the 
    absence of sales, offered for sale) in the exporting country after 
    the issuance of an antidumping duty order may be considered by the 
    administering authority as evidence of the establishment of a 
    fictitious market for the foreign like product if the movement in 
    such prices appears to reduce the amount by which the normal value 
    exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) of the 
    subject merchandise.
        ``(3) Exportation from an intermediate country.--Where the 
    subject merchandise is exported to the United States from an 
    intermediate country, normal value shall be determined in the 
    intermediate country, except that normal value may be determined in 
    the country of origin of the subject merchandise if--

            ``(D) the foreign like product is not produced in the 
        intermediate country.
        ``(4) Use of constructed value.--If the administering authority 
    determines that the normal value of the subject merchandise cannot 
    be determined under paragraph (1)(B)(i), then, notwithstanding 
    paragraph (1)(B)(ii), the normal value of the subject merchandise 
    may be the constructed value of that merchandise, as determined 
    under subsection (e).
        ``(5) Indirect sales or offers for sale.--If the foreign like 
    product is sold or, in the absence of sales, offered for sale 
    through an affiliated party, the prices at which the foreign like 
    product is sold (or offered for sale) by such affiliated party may 
    be used in determining normal value.

        otherwise provided under this section) that is established to 
        the satisfaction of the administering authority to be wholly or 
        partly due to--

            sales at different levels of trade in the country in which 
            normal value is determined.
        In a case described in the preceding sentence, the amount of 
        the adjustment shall be based on the price differences between 
        the two levels of trade in the country in which normal value is 
        determined.
            ``(B) Constructed export price offset.--When normal value 
        is established at a level of trade which constitutes a more 
        advanced stage of distribution than the level of trade of the 
        constructed export price, but the data available do not provide 
        an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a 
        level of trade adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the 
        amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in 
        which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like 
        product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which 
        a deduction is made under section 772(d)(1)(D).

    determined under subsection (e), may be adjusted, as appropriate, 
    pursuant to this subsection.

        ``(1) Determination; sales disregarded.--Whenever the 
    administering authority has reasonable grounds to believe or 
    suspect that sales of the foreign like product under consideration 
    for the determination of normal value have been made at prices 
    which represent less than the cost of production of that product, 
    the administering authority shall determine whether, in fact, such 
    sales were made at less than the cost of production. If the 
    administering authority determines that sales made at less than the 
    cost of production--
            ``(A) have been made within an extended period of time in 
        substantial quantities, and

    such sales may be disregarded in the determination of normal value. 
    Whenever such sales are disregarded, normal value shall be based on 
    the remaining sales of the foreign like product in the ordinary 
    course of trade. If no sales made in the ordinary course of trade 
    remain, the normal value shall be based on the constructed value of 
    the merchandise.

            party described in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) 
            of section 771(9) provides information, based upon observed 
            prices or constructed prices or costs, that sales of the 
            foreign like product under consideration for the 
            determination of normal value have been made at prices

            paragraph (1) in the investigation or if a review has been 
            completed, in the most recently completed review.

        of time' means a period that is normally 1 year, but not less 
        than 6 months.
            ``(C) Substantial quantities.--Sales made at prices below 
        the cost of production have been made in substantial quantities

        nature, and all other expenses incidental to placing the 
        foreign like product in condition packed ready for shipment.
    For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the normal value is based on 
    the price of the foreign like product sold for consumption in a 
    country other than the exporting country, the cost of materials 
    shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the 
    exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition 
    which are remitted or refunded upon exportation.

        information does not permit the normal value of the subject 
        merchandise to be determined under subsection (a),
    the administering authority shall determine the normal value of the 
    subject merchandise on the basis of the value of the factors of 
    production utilized in producing the merchandise and to which shall 
    be added an amount for general expenses and profit plus the cost of 
    containers, coverings, and other expenses. Except as provided in 
    paragraph (2), the valuation of the factors of production shall be 
    based on the best available information regarding the values of 
    such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to 
    be appropriate by the administering authority.
        ``(2) Exception.--If the administering authority finds that the 
    available information is inadequate for purposes of determining the 
    normal value of subject merchandise under paragraph (1), the 
    administering authority shall determine the normal value on the 
    basis of the price at which merchandise that is--

    authority, in valuing factors of production under paragraph (1), 
    shall utilize, to the extent possible, the prices or costs of 
    factors of production in one or more market economy countries that 
    are--
            ``(A) at a level of economic development comparable to that

Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this title, the 
administering authority determines that--

    being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, 
    directly or indirectly, by a person, firm, or corporation which 
    also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities for 
    the production of the foreign like product which are located in 
    another country or countries,

    one or more of the facilities outside the exporting country is 
    higher than the normal value of the foreign like product produced 
    in the facilities located in the exporting country,
it shall determine the normal value of the subject merchandise by 
reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is sold 
in substantial quantities from one or more facilities outside the 
exporting country. The administering authority, in making any 
determination under this paragraph, shall make adjustments for the 
difference between the cost of production (including taxes, labor, 
materials, and overhead) of the foreign like product produced in 
facilities outside the exporting country and costs of production of the 
foreign like product produced in facilities in the exporting country, 
if such differences are demonstrated to its satisfaction. For purposes 
of this subsection, in determining the normal value of the foreign like 
product produced in a country outside of the exporting country, the 
administering authority shall determine its price at the time of 
exportation from the exporting country and shall make any adjustments 
required by subsection (a) for the cost of all containers and coverings 
and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the 
merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the United States 
by reference to such costs in the exporting country.
    ``(e) Constructed Value.--For purposes of this title, the 
constructed value of imported merchandise shall be an amount equal to

    States.
 For purposes of paragraph (1), the cost of materials shall be 
determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country 
imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or 
refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such 
materials.

Calculation of Constructed Value.--For purposes of subsections (b) and 
(e).--
        ``(1) Costs.--
            ``(A) In general.--Costs shall normally be calculated based 
        on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, 
        if such records are kept in accordance with the generally 
        accepted accounting principles of the exporting country (or the 
        producing country, where appropriate) and reasonably reflect 
        the costs associated with the production and sale of the 
        merchandise. The administering authority shall consider all 
        available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including 
        that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a 
        timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used 
        by the exporter or producer, in particular for establishing 
        appropriate amortization and depreciation periods, and 
        allowances for capital expenditures and other development 
        costs.
            ``(B) Nonrecurring costs.--Costs shall be adjusted 
        appropriately for those nonrecurring costs that benefit current 
        or future production, or both.
            ``(C) Startup costs.--
                ``(i) In general.--Costs shall be adjusted 
            appropriately for circumstances in which costs incurred 
            during the time period covered by the investigation or 
            review are affected by startup operations.
                ``(ii) Startup operations.--Adjustments shall be made 
            for startup operations only where--

                    ``(I) a producer is using new production facilities 
                or producing a new product that requires substantial 
                additional investment, and

                factors associated with the initial phase of commercial 
                production.

            For purposes of subclause (II), the initial phase of 
            commercial production ends at the end of the startup 
            period. In determining whether commercial production levels 
            have been achieved, the administering authority shall 
            consider factors unrelated to startup operations that might 
            affect the volume of production processed, such as demand, 
            seasonality, or business cycles.
                ``(iii) Adjustment for startup operations.--The 
            adjustment for startup operations shall be made by 
            substituting the unit production costs incurred with 
            respect to the merchandise at the end of the startup period 
            for the unit production costs incurred during the startup 
            period. If the startup period extends beyond the period of 
            the investigation or review under this title, the 
            administering authority shall use the most recent cost of 
            production data that it reasonably can obtain, analyze, and 
            verify without delaying the timely completion of the 
            investigation or review. For purposes of this subparagraph, 
            the startup period ends at the point at which the level of 
            commercial production that is characteristic of the 
            merchandise, producer, or industry concerned is achieved.
        ``(2) Transactions disregarded.--A transaction directly or 
    indirectly between affiliated persons may be disregarded if, in the 
    case of any element of value required to be considered, the amount 
    representing that element does not fairly reflect the amount 
    usually reflected in sales of merchandise under consideration in 
    the market under consideration. If a transaction is disregarded 
    under the preceding sentence and no other transactions are 
    available for consideration, the determination of the amount shall 
    be based on the information available as to what the amount would 
    have been if the transaction had occurred between persons who are 
    not affiliated.
        ``(3) Major input rule.--If, in the case of a transaction 
    between affiliated persons involving the production by one of such 
    persons of a major input to the merchandise, the administering 
    authority has reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that an 
    amount represented as the value of such input is less than the cost 
    of production of such input, then the administering authority may 
    determine the value of the major input on the basis of the 
    information available regarding such cost of production, if such 
    cost is greater than the amount that would be determined for such 
    input under paragraph (2).''.

sale of the subject merchandise, except that, if it is established that 
a currency transaction on forward markets is directly linked to an 
export sale under consideration, the exchange rate specified with 
respect to such currency in the forward sale agreement shall be used to 
convert the foreign currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates shall be 
ignored.

      DUMPING MARGIN.
    (a) In General.--Section 777A (19 U.S.C. 1677f-1) is amended to 
read as follows:
``SEC. 777A. SAMPLING AND AVERAGING; DETERMINATION OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE 
DUMPING MARGIN.
    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of determining the export price (or 
constructed export price) under section 772 or the normal value under 
section 773, and in carrying out reviews under section 751, the 
administering authority may--
        ``(1) use averaging and statistically valid samples, if there 
    is a significant volume of sales of the subject merchandise or a 
    significant number or types of products, and
        ``(2) decline to take into account adjustments which are 
    insignificant in relation to the price or value of the merchandise.
    ``(b) Selection of Averages and Samples.--The authority to select 
averages and statistically valid samples shall rest exclusively with 
the administering authority. The administering authority shall, to the 
greatest extent possible, consult with the exporters and producers 
regarding the method to be used to select exporters, producers, or 
types of products under this section.
    ``(c) Determination of Dumping Margin.--
        ``(1) General rule.--In determining weighted average dumping 
    margins under section 733(d), 735(c), or 751(a), the administering 
    authority shall determine the individual weighted average dumping 
    margin for each known exporter and producer of the subject 
    merchandise.
        ``(2) Exception.--If it is not practicable to make individual 
    weighted average dumping margin determinations under paragraph (1) 
    because of the large number of exporters or producers involved in 
    the investigation or review, the administering authority may 
    determine the weighted average dumping margins for a reasonable 
    number of exporters or producers by limiting its examination to--
            ``(A) a sample of exporters, producers, or types of 
        products that is statistically valid based on the information 
        available to the administering authority at the time of 
        selection, or
            ``(B) exporters and producers accounting for the largest 
        volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country 
        that can be reasonably examined.
    ``(d) Determination of Less Than Fair Value.--
        ``(1) Investigations.--
            ``(A) In general.--In an investigation under subtitle B, 
        the administering authority shall determine whether the subject 
        merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than 
        fair value--
                ``(i) by comparing the weighted average of the normal 
            values to the weighted average of the export prices (and

            transactions to the export prices (or constructed export 
            prices) of individual transactions for comparable 
            merchandise.
            ``(B) Exception.--The administering authority may determine 
        whether the subject merchandise is being sold in the United 
        States at less than fair value by comparing the weighted 
        average of the normal values to the export prices (or 
        constructed export prices) of individual transactions for 
        comparable merchandise, if--
                ``(i) there is a pattern of export prices (or 
            constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise that 
            differ significantly among purchasers, regions, or periods 
            of time, and
                ``(ii) the administering authority explains why such 
            differences cannot be taken into account using a method 
            described in paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (ii).
        ``(2) Reviews.--In a review under section 751, when comparing 
    export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual 
    transactions to the weighted average price of sales of the foreign 
    like product, the administering authority shall limit its averaging 
    of prices to a period not exceeding the calendar month that 
    corresponds most closely to the calendar month of the individual 
    export sale.''.
    (b) Dumping Margin; Weighted Average Dumping Margin.--Section 771 
(19 U.S.C. 1677), as amended by section 222(i), is amended by adding at 
the end the following new paragraph:
        ``(35) Dumping margin; weighted average dumping margin.--
            ``(A) Dumping margin.--The term `dumping margin' means the 
        amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or 
        constructed export price of the subject merchandise.

            section 733(a) in an investigation (including any 
            investigation in which the Commission cumulatively assesses

            (7)(G)(i)), the dumping margin or margins published by the 
            administering authority in its notice of initiation of the 
            investigation;
                ``(ii) in making a final determination under section 
            735(b), the dumping margin or margins most recently 
            published by the administering authority prior to the 
            closing of the Commission's administrative record;
                ``(iii) in a review under section 751(b)(2), the most 
            recent dumping margin or margins determined by the 
            administering authority under section 752(c)(3), if any, or 
            under section 733(b) or 735(a); and

SEC. 231. EVIDENCE.

    (a) Conduct of Investigations and Administrative Reviews.--Subtitle 
D of title VII (19 U.S.C. 1671) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:
``SEC. 782. CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS.
    ``(a) Treatment of Voluntary Responses in Countervailing or 
Antidumping Duty Investigations and Reviews.--In any investigation 
under subtitle A or B or a review under section 751(a) in which the 
administering authority has, under section 777A(c)(2) or section 
777A(e)(2)(A) (whichever is applicable), limited the number of 
exporters or producers examined, or determined a single country-wide 
rate, the administering authority shall establish an individual 
countervailable subsidy rate or an individual weighted average dumping 
margin for any exporter or producer not initially selected for 
individual examination under such sections who submits to the 
administering authority the information requested from exporters or 
producers selected for examination, if--
        ``(1) such information is so submitted by the date specified--
            ``(A) for exporters and producers that were initially 
        selected for examination, or
            ``(B) for the foreign government, in a countervailing duty 
        case where the administering authority has determined a single 
        country-wide rate; and
        ``(2) the number of exporters or producers who have submitted 
    such information is not so large that individual examination of 
    such exporters or producers would be unduly burdensome and inhibit 
    the timely completion of the investigation.
    ``(b) Certification of Submissions.--Any person providing factual 
information to the administering authority or the Commission in 
connection with a proceeding under this title on behalf of the 
petitioner or any other interested party shall certify that such 
information is accurate and complete to the best of that person's 
knowledge.
    ``(c) Difficulties in Meeting Requirements.--
        ``(1) Notification by interested party.--If an interested 
    party, promptly after receiving a request from the administering 
    authority or the Commission for information, notifies the 
    administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) that 
    such party is unable to submit the information requested in the 
    requested form and manner, together with a full explanation and 
    suggested alternative forms in which such party is able to submit 
    the information, the administering authority or the Commission (as 
    the case may be) shall consider the ability of the interested party 
    to submit the information in the requested form and manner and may 
    modify such requirements to the extent necessary to avoid imposing 
    an unreasonable burden on that party.
        ``(2) Assistance to interested parties.--The administering 
    authority and the Commission shall take into account any 
    difficulties experienced by interested parties, particularly small 
    companies, in supplying information requested by the administering 
    authority or the Commission in connection with investigations and 
    reviews under this title, and shall provide to such interested 
    parties any assistance that is practicable in supplying such 
    information.
    ``(d) Deficient Submissions.--If the administering authority or the 
Commission determines that a response to a request for information 
under this title does not comply with the request, the administering 
authority or the Commission (as the case may be) shall promptly inform 
the person submitting the response of the nature of the deficiency and 
shall, to the extent practicable, provide that person with an 
opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency in light of the time 
limits established for the completion of investigations or reviews 
under this title. If that person submits further information in 
response to such deficiency and either--
        ``(1) the administering authority or the Commission (as the 
    case may be) finds that such response is not satisfactory, or
        ``(2) such response is not submitted within the applicable time 
    limits,
then the administering authority or the Commission (as the case may be) 
may, subject to subsection (e), disregard all or part of the original

                    Subtitle B--Subsidies Provisions

                   PART 1--COUNTERVAILABLE SUBSIDIES

SEC. 251. COUNTERVAILABLE SUBSIDY.

    (a) In General.--Section 771 (19 U.S.C. 1677) is amended by 
striking paragraph (5) and inserting the following:
        ``(5) Countervailable subsidy.--
            ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (5B), a 
        countervailable subsidy is a subsidy described in this 
        paragraph which is specific as described in paragraph (5A).
            ``(B) Subsidy described.--A subsidy is described in this 
        paragraph in the case in which an authority--
                ``(i) provides a financial contribution,
                ``(ii) provides any form of income or price support 
            within the meaning of Article XVI of the GATT 1994, or
                ``(iii) makes a payment to a funding mechanism to 
            provide a financial contribution, or entrusts or directs a 
            private entity to make a financial contribution, if 
            providing the contribution would normally be vested in the 
            government and the practice does not differ in substance 
            from practices normally followed by governments,
        to a person and a benefit is thereby conferred. For purposes of 
        this paragraph and paragraphs (5A) and (5B), the term 
        `authority' means a government of a country or any public 
        entity within the territory of the country.
            ``(C) Other factors.--The determination of whether a 
        subsidy exists shall be made without regard to whether the 
        recipient of the subsidy is publicly or privately owned and 
        without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly or 
        indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of 
        merchandise. The administering authority is not required to 
        consider the effect of the subsidy in determining whether a 
        subsidy exists under this paragraph.
            ``(D) Financial contribution.--The term `financial 
        contribution' means--
                ``(i) the direct transfer of funds, such as grants, 
            loans, and equity infusions, or the potential direct 
            transfer of funds or liabilities, such as loan guarantees,
                ``(ii) foregoing or not collecting revenue that is 
            otherwise due, such as granting tax credits or deductions 
            from taxable income,
                ``(iii) providing goods or services, other than general 
            infrastructure, or
                ``(iv) purchasing goods.
            ``(E) Benefit conferred.--A benefit shall normally be 
        treated as conferred where there is a benefit to the recipient, 
        including--
                ``(i) in the case of an equity infusion, if the 
            investment decision is inconsistent with the usual 
            investment practice of private investors, including the 
            practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the 
            country in which the equity infusion is made,
                ``(ii) in the case of a loan, if there is a difference 
            between the amount the recipient of the loan pays on the 
            loan and the amount the recipient would pay on a comparable 
            commercial loan that the recipient could actually obtain on 
            the market,
                ``(iii) in the case of a loan guarantee, if there is a 
            difference, after adjusting for any difference in guarantee 
            fees, between the amount the recipient of the guarantee 
            pays on the guaranteed loan and the amount the recipient 
            would pay for a comparable commercial loan if there were no 
            guarantee by the authority, and
                ``(iv) in the case where goods or services are 
            provided, if such goods or services are provided for less 
            than adequate remuneration, and in the case where goods are 
            purchased, if such goods are purchased for more than 
            adequate remuneration.
        For purposes of clause (iv), the adequacy of remuneration shall 
        be determined in relation to prevailing market conditions for 
        the good or service being provided or the goods being purchased 
        in the country which is subject to the investigation or review. 
        Prevailing market conditions include price, quality, 
        availability, marketability, transportation, and other 
        conditions of purchase or sale.
            ``(F) Change in ownership.--A change in ownership of all or 
        part of a foreign enterprise or the productive assets of a 
        foreign enterprise does not by itself require a determination 
        by the administering authority that a past countervailable 
        subsidy received by the enterprise no longer continues to be 
        countervailable, even if the change in ownership is 
        accomplished through an arm's length transaction.
        ``(5A) Specificity.--
            ``(A) In general.--A subsidy is specific if it is an export 
        subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or an import substitution 
        subsidy described in subparagraph (C), or if it is determined 
        to be specific pursuant to subparagraph (D).
            ``(B) Export subsidy.--An export subsidy is a subsidy that 
        is, in law or in fact, contingent upon export performance, 
        alone or as 1 of 2 or more conditions.
            ``(C) Import substitution subsidy.--An import substitution 
        subsidy is a subsidy that is contingent upon the use of 
        domestic goods over imported goods, alone or as 1 of 2 or more 
        conditions.
            ``(D) Domestic subsidy.--In determining whether a subsidy 
        (other than a subsidy described in subparagraph (B) or (C)) is 
        a specific subsidy, in law or in fact, to an enterprise or 
        industry within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the 
        subsidy, the following guidelines shall apply:
                ``(i) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or the 
            legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, 
            expressly limits access to the subsidy to an enterprise or 
            industry, the subsidy is specific as a matter of law.
                ``(ii) Where the authority providing the subsidy, or 
            the legislation pursuant to which the authority operates, 
            establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the 
            eligibility for, and the amount of, a subsidy, the subsidy 
            is not specific as a matter of law, if--

                    ``(I) eligibility is automatic,
                    ``(II) the criteria or conditions for eligibility 
                are strictly followed, and
                    ``(III) the criteria or conditions are clearly set 
                forth in the relevant statute, regulation, or other 
                official document so as to be capable of verification.

            For purposes of this clause, the term `objective criteria 
            or conditions' means criteria or conditions that are 
            neutral and that do not favor one enterprise or industry 
            over another.
                ``(iii) Where there are reasons to believe that a 
            subsidy may be specific as a matter of fact, the subsidy is 
            specific if one or more of the following factors exist:

                    ``(I) The actual recipients of the subsidy, whether 
                considered on an enterprise or industry basis, are 
                limited in number.
                    ``(II) An enterprise or industry is a predominant 
                user of the subsidy.
                    ``(III) An enterprise or industry receives a 
                disproportionately large amount of the subsidy.
                    ``(IV) The manner in which the authority providing 
                the subsidy has exercised discretion in the decision to 
                grant the subsidy indicates that an enterprise or 
                industry is favored over others.

            In evaluating the factors set forth in subclauses (I), 
            (II), (III), and (IV), the administering authority shall 
            take into account the extent of diversification of economic 
            activities within the jurisdiction of the authority 
            providing the subsidy, and the length of time during which 
            the subsidy program has been in operation.
                ``(iv) Where a subsidy is limited to an enterprise or 
            industry located within a designated geographical region 
            within the jurisdiction of the authority providing the 
            subsidy, the subsidy is specific.
    For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (5B), any reference to 
    an enterprise or industry is a reference to a foreign enterprise or 
    foreign industry and includes a group of such enterprises or 
    industries.
        ``(5B) Categories of noncountervailable subsidies.--
            ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the provisions of 
        paragraphs (5) and (5A), in the case of merchandise imported 
        from a Subsidies Agreement country, a subsidy shall be treated 
        as noncountervailable if the administering authority determines 
        in an investigation under subtitle A or a review under subtitle 
        C that the subsidy meets all of the criteria described in 
        subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), as the case may be, or the 
        provisions of subparagraph (E)(i) apply.
            ``(B) Research subsidy.--
                ``(i) In general.--Except for a subsidy provided on the 
            manufacture, production, or export of civil aircraft, a 
            subsidy for research activities conducted by a person, or 
            by a higher education or research establishment on a 
            contract basis with a person, shall be treated as 
            noncountervailable, if the subsidy covers not more than 75 
            percent of the costs of industrial research or not more 
            than 50 percent of the costs of precompetitive development 
            activity, and such subsidy is limited exclusively to--

                    ``(I) the costs of researchers, technicians, and 
                other supporting staff employed exclusively in the 
                research activity,
                    ``(II) the costs of instruments, equipment, land, 
                or buildings that are used exclusively and permanently 
                (except when disposed of on a commercial basis) for the 
                research activity,
                    ``(III) the costs of consultancy and equivalent 
                services used exclusively for the research activity, 
                including costs for bought-in research, technical 
                knowledge, and patents,
                    ``(IV) additional overhead costs incurred directly 
                as a result of the research activity, and
                    ``(V) other operating costs (such as materials and 
                supplies) incurred directly as a result of the research 
                activity.

            subparagraph--

                    ``(I) Industrial research.--The term `industrial 
                research' means planned search or critical 
                investigation aimed at the discovery of new knowledge, 
                with the objective that such knowledge may be useful in 
                developing new products, processes, or services, or in 
                bringing about a significant improvement to existing 
                products, processes, or services.
                    ``(II) Precompetitive development activity.--The 
                term `precompetitive development activity' means the 
                translation of industrial research findings into a 
                plan, blueprint, or design for new, modified, or 
                improved products, processes, or services, whether 
                intended for sale or use, including the creation of a 
                first prototype that would not be capable of commercial 
                use. The term also may include the conceptual 
                formulation and design of products, processes, or 
                services alternatives and initial demonstration or 
                pilot projects, if these same projects cannot be 
                converted or used for industrial application or 
                commercial exploitation. The term does not include 
                routine or periodic alterations to existing products, 
                production lines, manufacturing processes, services, or 
                other ongoing operations even if those alterations may 
                represent improvements.

                ``(iii) Calculation rules.--

                    ``(I) In general.--In the case of a research 
                activity that spans both industrial research and 
                precompetitive development activity, the allowable 
                level of the noncountervailable subsidy shall not 
                exceed 62.5 percent of the costs set forth in 
                subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) of clause 
                (i).

                of a noncountervailable subsidy described in clause (i) 
                shall be based on the total eligible costs incurred 
                over the duration of a particular project.

            ``(C) Subsidy to disadvantaged regions.--
                ``(i) In general.--A subsidy provided, pursuant to a 
            general framework of regional development, to a person 
            located in a disadvantaged region within a country shall be 
            treated as noncountervailable, if it is not specific 
            (within the meaning of paragraph (5A)) within eligible 
            regions and if the following conditions are met:

                    ``(I) Each region identified as disadvantaged 
                within the territory of a country is a clearly 
                designated, contiguous geographical area with a 
                definable economic and administrative identity.
                    ``(II) Each region is considered a disadvantaged 
                region on the basis of neutral and objective criteria 
                indicating that the region is disadvantaged because of 
                more than temporary circumstances, and such criteria 
                are clearly stated in the relevant statute, regulation, 
                or other official document so as to be capable of 
                verification.

                of regional development include ceilings on the amount 
                of assistance that can be granted to a subsidized 
                project. Such ceilings are differentiated according to 
                the different levels of development of assisted 
                regions, and are expressed in terms of investment costs 
                or costs of job creation. Within such ceilings, the 
                distribution of assistance is sufficiently broad and 
                even to avoid the predominant use of a subsidy by, or 
                the provision of disproportionately large amounts of a 
                subsidy to, an enterprise or industry as described in 
                paragraph (5A)(D).

            The measurement of economic development shall cover a 3-
            year period, but may be a composite measurement and may 
            include factors other than those set forth in this clause.

                internally consistent and generally applicable regional 
                development policy, and that regional development 
                subsidies are not granted in isolated geographical

                disparities within the framework of the regional

    or sold (or likely to be sold) for importation, into the United 
    States, and

duty, in addition to any other duty imposed, equal to the amount of the 
net countervailable subsidy. For purposes of this subsection and

        minimis countervailable subsidy. For purposes of the preceding

                notifies the administering authority that such country 
                is providing an export subsidy.''.

    (b) Final Determinations.--Section 705(a) (19 U.S.C. 1671d(a)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
        ``(3) De minimis countervailable subsidy.--In making a

    the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which 
    such investigations are treated as initiated on the same day.

    Commission shall render its determination in the investigation 
    conducted under this section at the same time as the Commission's 
    determination is made in the review under section 751(c) that is 
    initiated pursuant to this subsection. The Commission shall in all

                               AGREEMENT

SEC. 281. SUBSIDIES ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Assistance Regarding Multilateral Subsidy Remedies.--The 
administering authority shall provide information to the public upon 
request, and, to the extent feasible, assistance and advice to 
interested parties concerning--
        (1) remedies and benefits available under relevant provisions 
    of the Subsidies Agreement, and
        (2) the procedures relating to such remedies and benefits.
    (b) Prohibited Subsidies.--
        (1) Notification of trade representative.--If the administering 
    authority determines pursuant to title VII of the Tariff Act of 
    1930 that a class or kind of merchandise is benefiting from a 
    subsidy which is prohibited under Article 3 of the Subsidies 
    Agreement, the administering authority shall notify the Trade 
    Representative and shall provide the Trade Representative with the 
    information upon which the administering authority based its 
    determination.
        (2) Request by interested party regarding prohibited subsidy.--
    An interested party may request that the administering authority 
    determine if there is reason to believe that merchandise produced 
    in a WTO member country is benefiting from a subsidy which is 
    prohibited under Article 3 of the Subsidies Agreement. The request 
    shall contain such information as the administering authority may 
    require to support the allegations contained in the request. If the 
    administering authority, after analyzing the request and other 
    information reasonably available to the administering authority, 
    determines that there is reason to believe that such merchandise is 
    benefiting from a subsidy which is prohibited under Article 3 of 
    the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority shall so 
    notify the Trade Representative, and shall include supporting 
    information with the notification.
    (c) Subsidies Actionable Under the Agreement.--
        (1) In general.--If the administering authority determines 
    pursuant to title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 that a class or 
    kind of merchandise is benefiting from a subsidy described in 
    Article 6.1 of the Subsidies Agreement, the administering authority 
    shall notify the Trade Representative, and shall provide the Trade 
    Representative with the information upon which the administering 
    authority based its determination.
        (2) Request by interested party regarding adverse effects.--An 
    interested party may request the administering authority to 
    determine if there is reason to believe that a subsidy which is 
    actionable under the Subsidies Agreement is causing adverse 
    effects. The request shall contain such information as the 
    administering authority may require to support the allegations 
    contained in the request. At the request of the administering 
    authority, the Commission shall assist the administering authority 
    in analyzing the information pertaining to the existence of such 
    adverse effects. If the administering authority, after analyzing 
    the request and other information reasonably available to the 
    administering authority, determines that there is reason to believe 
    that a subsidy which is actionable under the Subsidies Agreement is 
    causing adverse effects, the administering authority shall so 
    notify the Trade Representative, and shall include supporting 
    information with the notification.
    (d) Initiation of Section 301 Investigation.--On the basis of the 
notification and information provided by the administering authority 
pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), such other information as the Trade 
Representative may have or obtain, and where applicable, after 
consultation with an interested party referred to in subsection (b)(2) 
or (c)(2), the Trade Representative shall, unless such interested party 
objects, determine as expeditiously as possible, in accordance with the 
procedures in section 302(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 
2412(b)(1)), whether to initiate an investigation pursuant to title III 
of that Act (19 U.S.C. 2411 et seq.). At the request of the Trade 
Representative, the administering authority and the Commission shall 
assist the Trade Representative in an investigation initiated pursuant 
to this subsection.
    (e) Nonactionable Subsidies.--
        (1) Compliance with article 8 of the subsidies agreement.--
            (A) Monitoring.--In order to monitor whether a subsidy 
        meets the conditions and criteria described in Article 8.2 of 
        the Subsidies Agreement and is nonactionable, the Trade 
        Representative shall provide the administering authority on a 
        timely basis with any information submitted or report made 
        pursuant to Article 8.3 or 8.4 of the Subsidies Agreement 
        regarding a notified subsidy program. The administering 
        authority shall review such information and reports, and where 
        appropriate, shall recommend to the Trade Representative that 
        the Trade Representative seek pursuant to Article 8.3 or 8.4 of 
        the Subsidies Agreement additional information regarding the 
        notified subsidy program or a subsidy granted pursuant to the 
        notified subsidy program. If the administering authority has 
        reason to believe that a violation of Article 8 of the 
        Subsidies Agreement exists, the administering authority shall 
        so notify the Trade Representative, and shall include 
        supporting information with the notification.
            (B) Request by interested party regarding violation of 
        article 8.--An interested party may request the administering 
        authority to determine if there is reason to believe that a 
        violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement exists. The 
        request shall contain such information as the administering 
        authority may require to support the allegations contained in 
        the request. If the administering authority, after analyzing 
        the request and other information reasonably available to the 
        administering authority, determines that additional information 
        is needed, the administering authority shall recommend to the 
        Trade Representative that the Trade Representative seek, 
        pursuant to Article 8.3 or 8.4 of the Subsidies Agreement, 
        additional information regarding the particular notified 
        subsidy program or a subsidy granted pursuant to the notified 
        subsidy program. If the administering authority determines that 
        there is reason to believe that a violation of Article 8 of the 
        Subsidies Agreement exists, the administering authority shall 
        so notify the Trade Representative, and shall include 
        supporting information with the notification.
            (C) Action by trade representative.--
                (i) If the Trade Representative, on the basis of the 
            notification and information provided by the administering 
            authority pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B), and such 
            other information as the Trade Representative may have or 
            obtain, and after consulting with the interested party 
            referred to in subparagraph (B) and appropriate domestic 
            industries, determines that there is reason to believe that 
            a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement exists, 
            the Trade Representative shall invoke the procedures of 
            Article 8.4 or 8.5 of the Subsidies Agreement.
                (ii) For purposes of clause (i), the Trade 
            Representative shall determine that there is reason to 
            believe that a violation of Article 8 exists in any case in 
            which the Trade Representative determines that a notified 
            subsidy program or a subsidy granted pursuant to a notified 
            subsidy program does not satisfy the conditions and 
            criteria required for a nonactionable subsidy program under 
            this Act, the Subsidies Agreement, and the statement of 
            administrative action approved under section 101(a).
            (D) Notification of administering authority.--The Trade 
        Representative shall notify the administering authority 
        whenever a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement 
        has been found to exist pursuant to Article 8.4 or 8.5 of that 
        Agreement.
        (2) Serious adverse effects.--
            (A) Request by interested party.--An interested party may 
        request the administering authority to determine if there is 
        reason to believe that serious adverse effects resulting from a 
        program referred to in Article 8.2 of the Subsidies Agreement 
        exist. The request shall contain such information as the 
        administering authority may require to support the allegations 
        contained in the request.
            (B) Action by administering authority.--Within 90 days 
        after receipt of the request described in subparagraph (A), the 
        administering authority, after analyzing the request and other 
        information reasonably available to the administering 
        authority, shall determine if there is reason to believe that 
        serious adverse effects resulting from a program referred to in 
        Article 8.2 of the Subsidies Agreement exist. If the 
        determination of the administering authority is affirmative, it 
        shall so notify the Trade Representative and shall include 
        supporting information with the notification. The Commission 
        shall assist the administering authority in analyzing the 
        information pertaining to the existence of such serious adverse 
        effects if the administering authority requests the 
        Commission's assistance. If the subsidy program that is alleged 
        to result in serious adverse effects has been the subject of a 
        countervailing duty investigation or review under subtitle A or 
        C of title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, the administering 
        authority shall take into account the determinations made by 
        the administering authority and the Commission in such 
        investigation or review and the administering authority shall 
        complete its analysis as expeditiously as possible.
            (C) Action by trade representative.--The Trade 
        Representative, on the basis of the notification and 
        information provided by the administering authority pursuant to 
        subparagraph (B), and such other information as the Trade 
        Representative may have or obtain, shall determine as 
        expeditiously as possible, but not later than 30 days after 
        receipt of the notification provided by the administering 
        authority, if there is reason to believe that serious adverse 
        effects exist resulting from the subsidy program which is the 
        subject of the administering authority's notification. The 
        Trade Representative shall make an affirmative determination 
        regarding the existence of such serious adverse effects unless 
        the Trade Representative finds that the notification of the 
        administering authority is not supported by the facts.
            (D) Consultations.--If the Trade Representative determines 
        that there is reason to believe that serious adverse effects 
        resulting from the subsidy program exist, the Trade 
        Representative, unless the interested party referred to in 
        subparagraph (A) objects, shall invoke the procedures of 
        Article 9 of the Subsidies Agreement, and shall request 
        consultations pursuant to Article 9.2 of the Subsidies 
        Agreement with respect to such serious adverse effects. If such 
        consultations have not resulted in a mutually acceptable 
        solution within 60 days after the request is made for such 
        consultations, the Trade Representative shall refer the matter 
        to the Subsidies Committee pursuant to Article 9.3 of the 
        Subsidies Agreement.
            (E) Determination by subsidies committee.--If the Trade 
        Representative determines that--
                (i) the Subsidies Committee has been prevented from 
            making an affirmative determination regarding the existence 
            of serious adverse effects under Article 9 of the Subsidies 
            Agreement by reason of the refusal of the WTO member 
            country with respect to which the consultations have been 
            invoked to join in an affirmative consensus--

                    (I) that such serious adverse effects exist, or
                    (II) regarding a recommendation to such WTO member 
                country to modify the subsidy program in such a way as 
                to remove the serious adverse effects, or

                (ii) the Subsidies Committee has not presented its 
            conclusions regarding the existence of such serious adverse 
            effects within 120 days after the date the matter was 
            referred to it, as required by Article 9.4 of the Subsidies 
            Agreement,
        the Trade Representative shall, within 30 days after such 
        determination, make a determination under section 304(a)(1) of 
        the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)) regarding what 
        action to take under section 301(a)(1)(A) of that Act.
            (F) Noncompliance with committee recommendation.--In the 
        event that the Subsidies Committee makes a recommendation under 
        Article 9.4 of the Subsidies Agreement and the WTO member 
        country with respect to which such recommendation is made does 
        not comply with such recommendation within 6 months after the 
        date of the recommendation, the Trade Representative shall make 
        a determination under section 304(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 
        1974 (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)) regarding what action to take under

    product, or manufacture of that country, territory, or insular 
    possession, if--
            (A) the product is wholly obtained or produced in that 
        country, territory, or possession;
            (B) the product is a yarn, thread, twine, cordage, rope, 
        cable, or braiding and--
                (i) the constituent staple fibers are spun in that

            (C) the product is a fabric, including a fabric classified

        filaments, or yarns are woven, knitted, needled, tufted, 
        felted, entangled, or transformed by any other fabric-making 
        process in that country, territory, or possession; or
            (D) the product is any other textile or apparel product 
        that is wholly assembled in that country, territory, or 
        possession from its component pieces.
        (2) Special rules.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(D)--
            (A) the origin of a good that is classified under one of 
        the following HTS headings or subheadings shall be determined 
        under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), as

        9404.90; and

        shall be considered to originate in, and be the growth, 
        product, or manufacture of, the country, territory, or 
        possession in which it is knit.
        (3) Multicountry rule.--If the origin of a good cannot be

    manufacture of--
            (A) the country, territory, or possession in which the most 
        important assembly or manufacturing process occurs, or
            (B) if the origin of the good cannot be determined under 
        subparagraph (A), the last country, territory, or possession in 
        which important assembly or manufacturing occurs.
        (4) Components cut in the united states.--(A) The value of a 
    component that is cut to shape (but not to length, width, or both) 
    in the United States from foreign fabric and exported to another

    article that is then returned to the United States--
            (i) shall not be included in the dutiable value of such 
        article, and
            (ii) may be applied toward determining the percentage 
        referred to in General Note 7(b)(i)(B) of the HTS, subject to 
        the limitation provided in that note.

    components and components that are products of the United States, 
    in a beneficiary country as defined in General Note 7(a) of the HTS 
    shall be treated as a foreign article, or as subject to duty if--
            (i) the components after exportation from the United 
        States, and
            (ii) the article itself before importation into the United 
        States

    such a beneficiary country.

    This section shall not affect, for purposes of the customs laws and 
    administration of quantitative restrictions, the status of goods 
    that, under rulings and administrative practices in effect

    in, or been the growth, product, or manufacture of, a country that 
    is a party to an agreement with the United States establishing a 
    free trade area, which entered into force before January 1, 1987. 
    For such purposes, such rulings and administrative practices that 
    were applied, immediately before the enactment of this Act, to 
    determine the origin of textile and apparel products covered by 
    such agreement shall continue to apply after the enactment of this 
    Act, and on and after the effective date described in subsection 
    (c), unless such rulings and practices are modified by the mutual 
    consent of the parties to the agreement.

withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1996,

        ``(2) transmits or otherwise communicates to the public the 
    sounds or sounds and images of a live musical performance; or
        ``(3) distributes or offers to distribute, sells or offers to 
    sell, rents or offers to rent, or traffics in any copy or 
    phonorecord fixed as described in paragraph (1), regardless of 
    whether the fixations occurred in the United States;
shall be imprisoned for not more than 5 years or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both, or if the offense is a second or 
subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned for not more than 10 years or 
fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.
    ``(b) Forfeiture and Destruction.--When a person is convicted of a 
violation of subsection (a), the court shall order the forfeiture and 
destruction of any copies or phonorecords created in violation thereof,

negatives by means of which such copies or phonorecords may be made. 
The court may also, in its discretion, order the forfeiture and 
destruction of any other equipment by means of which such copies or 
phonorecords may be reproduced, taking into account the nature, scope, 
and proportionality of the use of the equipment in the offense.
    ``(c) Seizure and Forfeiture.--If copies or phonorecords of sounds 
or sounds and images of a live musical performance are fixed outside of 
the United States without the consent of the performer or performers 
involved, such copies or phonorecords are subject to seizure and 
forfeiture in the United States in the same manner as property imported 
in violation of the customs laws. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, 
not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay 
Round Agreements Act, issue regulations to carry out this subsection, 
including regulations by which any performer may, upon payment of a 
specified fee, be entitled to notification by the United States Customs 
Service of the importation of copies or phonorecords that appear to 
consist of unauthorized fixations of the sounds or sounds and images of 
a live musical performance.
    ``(d) Definitions.--As used in this section--
        ``(1) the terms `copy', `fixed', `musical work', `phonorecord', 
    `reproduce', `sound recordings', and `transmit' mean those terms 
    within the meaning of title 17; and
        ``(2) the term `traffic in' means transport, transfer, or 
    otherwise dispose of, to another, as consideration for anything of 
    value, or make or obtain control of with intent to transport, 
    transfer, or dispose of.

that occur on or after the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 113 of 
title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to section 2319 the following:

``2319A. Unauthorized fixation of and trafficking in sound recordings

SEC. 514. RESTORED WORKS.

    (a) In General.--Section 104A of title 17, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 104A. Copyright in restored works

    ``(a) Automatic Protection and Term.--
        ``(1) Term.--
            ``(A) Copyright subsists, in accordance with this section, 
        in restored works, and vests automatically on the date of 
        restoration.
            ``(B) Any work in which copyright is restored under this 
        section shall subsist for the remainder of the term of 
        copyright that the work would have otherwise been granted in 
        the United States if the work never entered the public domain 
        in the United States.
        ``(2) Exception.--Any work in which the copyright was ever 
    owned or administered by the Alien Property Custodian and in which 
    the restored copyright would be owned by a government or 
    instrumentality thereof, is not a restored work.
    ``(b) Ownership of Restored Copyright.--A restored work vests 
initially in the author or initial rightholder of the work as 
determined by the law of the source country of the work.
    ``(c) Filing of Notice of Intent to Enforce Restored Copyright 
Against Reliance Parties.--On or after the date of restoration, any 
person who owns a copyright in a restored work or an exclusive right 
therein may file with the Copyright Office a notice of intent to 
enforce that person's copyright or exclusive right or may serve such a 
notice directly on a reliance party. Acceptance of a notice by the 
Copyright Office is effective as to any reliance parties but shall not 
create a presumption of the validity of any of the facts stated 
therein. Service on a reliance party is effective as to that reliance 
party and any other reliance parties with actual knowledge of such 
service and of the contents of that notice.
    ``(d) Remedies for Infringement of Restored Copyrights.--
        ``(1) Enforcement of copyright in restored works in the absence 
    of a reliance party.--As against any party who is not a reliance 
    party, the remedies provided in chapter 5 of this title shall be 
    available on or after the date of restoration of a restored 
    copyright with respect to an act of infringement of the restored 
    copyright that is commenced on or after the date of restoration.
        ``(2) Enforcement of copyright in restored works as against 
    reliance parties.--As against a reliance party, except to the 
    extent provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the remedies provided in 
    chapter 5 of this title shall be available, with respect to an act 
    of infringement of a restored copyright, on or after the date of 
    restoration of the restored copyright if the requirements of either 
    of the following subparagraphs are met:
            ``(A)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such 
        owner's agent) or the owner of an exclusive right therein (or 
        such owner's agent) files with the Copyright Office, during the 
        24-month period beginning on the date of restoration, a notice 
        of intent to enforce the restored copyright; and
            ``(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end 
        of the 12-month period beginning on the date of publication of 
        the notice in the Federal Register;
            ``(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of 
        the 12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued 
        after the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies 
        shall be available only for infringement occurring after the 
        end of that 12-month period; or
            ``(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright 
        has been restored under this section are made after publication 
        of the notice of intent in the Federal Register.
            ``(B)(i) The owner of the restored copyright (or such 
        owner's agent) or the owner of an exclusive right therein (or 
        such owner's agent) serves upon a reliance party a notice of 
        intent to enforce a restored copyright; and
            ``(ii)(I) the act of infringement commenced after the end 
        of the 12-month period beginning on the date the notice of 
        intent is received;
            ``(II) the act of infringement commenced before the end of 
        the 12-month period described in subclause (I) and continued 
        after the end of that 12-month period, in which case remedies 
        shall be available only for the infringement occurring after 
        the end of that 12-month period; or
            ``(III) copies or phonorecords of a work in which copyright 
        has been restored under this section are made after receipt of 
        the notice of intent.
    In the event that notice is provided under both subparagraphs (A) 
    and (B), the 12-month period referred to in such subparagraphs 
    shall run from the earlier of publication or service of notice.
        ``(3) Existing derivative works.--(A) In the case of a 
    derivative work that is based upon a restored work and is created--
            ``(i) before the date of the enactment of the Uruguay Round 
        Agreements Act, if the source country of the derivative work is 
        an eligible country on such date, or
            ``(ii) before the date of adherence or proclamation, if the 
        source country of the derivative work is not an eligible 
        country on such date of enactment,
    a reliance party may continue to exploit that work for the duration 
    of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner 
    of the restored copyright reasonable compensation for conduct which 
    would be subject to a remedy for infringement but for the 
    provisions of this paragraph.
        ``(B) In the absence of an agreement between the parties, the 
    amount of such compensation shall be determined by an action in 
    United States district court, and shall reflect any harm to the 
    actual or potential market for or value of the restored work from 
    the reliance party's continued exploitation of the work, as well as 
    compensation for the relative contributions of expression of the 
    author of the restored work and the reliance party to the 
    derivative work.
        ``(4) Commencement of infringement for reliance parties.--For 
    purposes of section 412, in the case of reliance parties, 
    infringement shall be deemed to have commenced before registration 
    when acts which would have constituted infringement had the 
    restored work been subject to copyright were commenced before the 
    date of restoration.
    ``(e) Notices of Intent To Enforce a Restored Copyright.--
        ``(1) Notices of intent filed with the copyright office.--
    (A)(i) A notice of intent filed with the Copyright Office to 
    enforce a restored copyright shall be signed by the owner of the 
    restored copyright or the owner of an exclusive right therein, who 
    files the notice under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) (hereafter in this 
    paragraph referred to as the `owner'), or by the owner's agent, 
    shall identify the title of the restored work, and shall include an 
    English translation of the title and any other alternative titles 
    known to the owner by which the restored work may be identified, 
    and an address and telephone number at which the owner may be 
    contacted. If the notice is signed by an agent, the agency 
    relationship must have been constituted in a writing signed by the 
    owner before the filing of the notice. The Copyright Office may 
    specifically require in regulations other information to be 
    included in the notice, but failure to provide such other 
    information shall not invalidate the notice or be a basis for 
    refusal to list the restored work in the Federal Register.
        ``(ii) If a work in which copyright is restored has no formal 
    title, it shall be described in the notice of intent in detail 
    sufficient to identify it.
        ``(iii) Minor errors or omissions may be corrected by further 
    notice at any time after the notice of intent is filed. Notices of 
    corrections for such minor errors or omissions shall be accepted 
    after the period established in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i). Notices 
    shall be published in the Federal Register pursuant to subparagraph 
    (B).
        ``(B)(i) The Register of Copyrights shall publish in the 
    Federal Register, commencing not later than 4 months after the date 
    of restoration for a particular nation and every 4 months 
    thereafter for a period of 2 years, lists identifying restored 
    works and the ownership thereof if a notice of intent to enforce a 
    restored copyright has been filed.
        ``(ii) Not less than 1 list containing all notices of intent to 
    enforce shall be maintained in the Public Information Office of the 
    Copyright Office and shall be available for public inspection and 
    copying during regular business hours pursuant to sections 705 and 
    708. Such list shall also be published in the Federal Register on 
    an annual basis for the first 2 years after the applicable date of 
    restoration.
        ``(C) The Register of Copyrights is authorized to fix 
    reasonable fees based on the costs of receipt, processing, 
    recording, and publication of notices of intent to enforce a 
    restored copyright and corrections thereto.
        ``(D)(i) Not later than 90 days before the date the Agreement 
    on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property referred to in 
    section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act enters into 
    force with respect to the United States, the Copyright Office shall 
    issue and publish in the Federal Register regulations governing the 
    filing under this subsection of notices of intent to enforce a 
    restored copyright.
        ``(ii) Such regulations shall permit owners of restored 
    copyrights to file simultaneously for registration of the restored 
    copyright.
        ``(2) Notices of intent served on a reliance party.--(A) 
    Notices of intent to enforce a restored copyright may be served on 
    a reliance party at any time after the date of restoration of the 
    restored copyright.

    on a reliance party shall be signed by the owner or the owner's 
    agent, shall identify the restored work and the work in which the 
    restored work is used, if any, in detail sufficient to identify 
    them, and shall include an English translation of the title, any 
    other alternative titles known to the owner by which the work may 
    be identified, the use or uses to which the owner objects, and an 
    address and telephone number at which the reliance party may 
    contact the owner. If the notice is signed by an agent, the agency 
    relationship must have been constituted in writing and signed by 
    the owner before service of the notice.
        ``(3) Effect of material false statements.--Any material false 
    statement knowingly made with respect to any restored copyright 
    identified in any notice of intent shall make void all claims and 
    assertions made with respect to such restored copyright.
    ``(f) Immunity From Warranty and Related Liability.--
        ``(1) In general.--Any person who warrants, promises, or 
    guarantees that a work does not violate an exclusive right granted 
    in section 106 shall not be liable for legal, equitable, arbitral, 
    or administrative relief if the warranty, promise, or guarantee is 
    breached by virtue of the restoration of copyright under this 
    section, if such warranty, promise, or guarantee is made before 
    January 1, 1995.
        ``(2) Performances.--No person shall be required to perform any 
    act if such performance is made infringing by virtue of the 
    restoration of copyright under the provisions of this section, if

    ``(g) Proclamation of Copyright Restoration.--Whenever the 
President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by 
authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States, 
restored copyright protection on substantially the same basis as 
provided under this section, the President may by proclamation extend 
restored protection provided under this section to any work--

SEC. 521. DEFINITION OF ``ABANDONED''.

    Section 45 of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the 
registration and protection of trade-marks used in commerce, to carry 
out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other 
purposes'', approved July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1127) (hereafter in this 
title referred to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946''), is amended by 
amending the paragraph defining ``abandoned'' to read as follows:
    ``A mark shall be deemed to be `abandoned' if either of the 
following occurs:
        ``(1) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to 
    resume such use. Intent not to resume may be inferred from 
    circumstances. Nonuse for 3 consecutive years shall be prima facie 
    evidence of abandonment. `Use' of a mark means the bona fide use of 
    such mark made in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely 
    to reserve a right in a mark.
        ``(2) When any course of conduct of the owner, including acts 
    of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to become the 
    generic name for the goods or services on or in connection with 
    which it is used or otherwise to lose its significance as a mark. 
    Purchaser motivation shall not be a test for determining 
    abandonment under this paragraph.''.

matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection 
with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national 
symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical 
indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, 
identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used 
on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after 
one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in 
section 2(9) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act) enters into force 
with respect to the United States.''.

            met one of the following requirements (as in effect for 
            such year):

        telecommunications service or technology, except in accordance 
        with the requirements of this paragraph.
            ``(B) Recovery of value.--The Commission shall recover for 
        the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum 
        resource made available to such person by requiring such 
        person, as a condition for receipt of the license, to agree to 
        pay a sum determined by--

            that the Commission determines are most reasonably 
            comparable in terms of bandwidth, scope of service area, 
            usage restrictions, and other technical characteristics to 
            the license awarded to such person, and excluding licenses 
            that the Commission determines are subject to bidding

        contributions to the development of a new service or to the 
        development of new technologies that substantially enhance an 
        existing service. Such regulations shall--

            employees of the Commission or by any applicant for such 
            preferential treatment;
