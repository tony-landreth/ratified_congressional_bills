        S.J.Res. 56

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
  To designate the week beginning April 11, 1994, as ``National Public 
                                 Safety

                        Telecommunicators Week''.

Whereas over one-half million dedicated men and women are engaged in the 
  operation of emergency response systems for Federal, State, and local 
  governmental entities throughout the United States;
Whereas these individuals are responsible for responding to the 
  telephone calls of the general public for police, fire and emergency 
  medical assistance and for dispatching such assistance to help save 
  the lives and property of our citizens;
Whereas such calls include not only police, fire and emergency medical 
  service calls but those governmental communications related to 
  forestry and conservation operations, highway safety and maintenance 
  activities, and all of the other operations which modern governmental 
  agencies must conduct; and
Whereas America's public safety telecommunicators daily serve the public 
  in countless ways without due recognition by the beneficiaries of 
  their services: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning April 
11, 1994, is hereby designated as ``National Public Safety 
Telecommunicators Week''. The President is authorized and requested to 
issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to 
observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
