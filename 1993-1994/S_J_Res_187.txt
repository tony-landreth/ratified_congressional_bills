        S.J.Res. 187

                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
     Designating July 16 through July 24, 1994, as ``National Apollo

                        Anniversary Observance''.

Whereas President Kennedy in 1961 called upon the United States to face 
  the challenge of those extraordinary times by sending a mission to 
  the Moon;
Whereas the United States Government, the National Aeronautics and 
  Space Administration, and the American people committed great 
  resources, time, and human labor within one decade to span the 
  238,700 miles between the Earth and the Moon;
Whereas the United States rose to the challenge and formulated the 
  Apollo missions culminating in the liftoff on July 16, 1969, of the 
  Apollo 11 Mission to the Moon;
Whereas 25 years ago astronaut Neil Armstrong, with the help of Colonel 
  Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin, Jr. (USAF) and Lieutenant Colonel Michael 
  Collins (USAF), took that first significant step and became the first 
  human to set foot on the surface of another world;
Whereas that small step furthered the development of space technology 
  for the lasting benefit of all mankind; and
Whereas such an event united the world and our many cultures for a 
  brief moment under the flag of peaceful exploration: Now, therefore, 
  be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That July 16, 1994, through 
July 24, 1994, is designated as ``National Apollo Anniversary 
Observance'', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe such 
period with appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
