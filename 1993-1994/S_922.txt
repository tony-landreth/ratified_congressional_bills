                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

  To provide that a State court may not modify an order of another State 
court requiring the payment of child support unless the recipient of 
child support payments resides in the State in which the modification is 
sought or consents to the seeking of the modification in that court.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Full Faith and Credit for Child 
Support Orders Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
        (1) there is a large and growing number of child support cases 
    annually involving disputes between parents who reside in different 
    States;
        (2) the laws by which the courts of different jurisdictions 
    determine their authority to establish child support orders are not 
    uniform;
        (3) those laws, along with the limits imposed by the Federal 
    system on the authority of each State to take certain actions 
    outside its own boundaries--
            (A) encourage noncustodial parents to relocate outside the 
        States where their children and the custodial parents reside to 
        avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of such States, resulting 
        in an increase in the amount of interstate travel and 
        communication required to establish and collect on child 
        support orders and a burden on custodial parents that is 
        expensive, time consuming, and disruptive of occupations and 
        commercial activity;
            (B) contribute to the pressing problem of relatively low 
        levels of child support payments in interstate cases and to 
        inequities in child support payments levels that are based 
        solely on the noncustodial parent's choice of residence;
            (C) encourage a disregard of court orders resulting in 
        massive arrearages nationwide;
            (D) allow noncustodial parents to avoid the payment of 
        regularly scheduled child support payments for extensive 
        periods of time, resulting in substantial hardship for the 
        children for whom support is due and for their custodians; and
            (E) lead to the excessive relitigation of cases and to the 
        establishment of conflicting orders by the courts of various 
        jurisdictions, resulting in confusion, waste of judicial 
        resources, disrespect for the courts, and a diminution of 
        public confidence in the rule of law; and
        (4) among the results of the conditions described in this 
    subsection are--
            (A) the failure of the courts of the States to give full 
        faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other 
        States;
            (B) the deprivation of rights of liberty and property 
        without due process of law;
            (C) burdens on commerce among the States; and
            (D) harm to the welfare of children and their parents and 
        other custodians.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--In view of the findings made in 
subsection (a), it is necessary to establish national standards under 
which the courts of the various States shall determine their 
jurisdiction to issue a child support order and the effect to be given 
by each State to child support orders issued by the courts of other 
States.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
        (1) to facilitate the enforcement of child support orders among 
    the States;
        (2) to discourage continuing interstate controversies over 
    child support in the interest of greater financial stability and 
    secure family relationships for the child; and
        (3) to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict among 
    State courts in the establishment of child support orders.
