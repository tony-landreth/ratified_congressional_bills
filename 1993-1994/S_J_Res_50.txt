        S.J.Res. 50
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate the weeks of September 19, 1993, through September 25, 
1993, and of September 18, 1994, through September 24, 1994, as 
``National Rehabilitation Week''.

Whereas the designation of a week as ``National Rehabilitation Week'' 
  gives the people of this Nation an opportunity to celebrate the 
  victories, courage, and determination of individuals with disabilities 
  in this Nation and recognize dedicated health care professionals who 
  work daily to help such individuals achieve independence;
Whereas there are significant areas where the needs of such individuals 
  with disabilities have not been met, such as certain research and 
  educational needs;
Whereas half of the people of this Nation will need some form of 
  rehabilitation therapy;
Whereas rehabilitation agencies and facilities offer care and treatment 
  for individuals with physical, mental, emotional, and social 
  disabilities;
Whereas the goal of the rehabilitative services offered by such agencies 
  and facilities is to help disabled individuals lead active lives at 
  the greatest level of independence possible; and
Whereas the majority of the people of this Nation are not aware of the 
  limitless possibilities of invaluable rehabilitative services in this 
  Nation: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That--
        (1) the week of September 19, 1993, through September 25, 1993, 
    and of September 18, 1994, through September 24, 1994, is designated 
    as ``National Rehabilitation Week'' and the President is authorized 
    and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the 
    United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and 
    activities, including educational activities to heighten public 
    awareness of the types of rehabilitative services available in this 
    Nation and the manner in which such services improve the quality of 
    life of disabled individuals; and
        (2) each State governor, and each chief executive of each 
    political subdivision of each State, is urged to issue proclamation 
    (or other appropriate official statement) calling upon the citizens 
    of such State or political subdivision of a State to observe such 
    week in the manner described in paragraph (1).







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
