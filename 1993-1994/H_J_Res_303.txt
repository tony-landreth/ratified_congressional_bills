                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
 the twenty-fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-
                                  four


                            Joint Resolution


 
    To designate June 6, 1994, as ``D-Day National Remembrance Day''.

Whereas June 6, 1994, marks the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day, the day 
  of the beginning of the Allied assault at Normandy, France, during 
  World War II;
Whereas the D-Day assault, known as Operation Overlord, was the most 
  extensive amphibious operation ever to occur, involving on the first 
  day of the operation five thousand ships, over eleven thousand 
  sorties of Allied aircraft, and one hundred and fifty-three thousand 
  American, British, and Canadian troops;
Whereas five separate beaches were assaulted, with American forces 
  commanded by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley attacking Omaha and Utah 
  beaches and British and Canadian forces commanded by General Miles 
  Dempsey attacking Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches;
Whereas American troops suffered significant losses during the assault, 
  including over six thousand five hundred casualties;
Whereas the D-Day assault was among the most critical events of World 
  War II, with the success of the Allied landings in Normandy providing 
  the foothold for the liberation of France and the eventual Allied 
  breakthrough into Germany and leading ultimately to the Allied 
  victory in Europe; and
Whereas June 6, 1944, is one of the most significant dates in the 
  history of the United States: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That June 6, 1994, is 
designated as ``D-Day National Remembrance Day'', and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the 
people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.







                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
