    SEC. 233. PATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY-3 THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE 
      SYSTEM.
    (a) Competition for Missile Selection.--The Secretary of Defense 
shall continue the strategy being carried out by the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization as of October 1, 1993, for selection of the best 
technology (in terms of cost, schedule, risk, and performance) to meet 
the missile requirements for the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) 
theater missile defense system. That strategy, consisting of flight 
testing, ground testing, simulations, and other analyses of the weapon 
systems referred to in subsection (d), shall be continued until the 
Secretary determines that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has 
adequate information upon which to base a decision as to which missile 
will be selected to proceed into the Engineering and Manufacturing 
Development stage.
    (b) Implications of Delay.--If there is a delay (based upon the 
schedule in effect in October 1993) in the selection described in 
subsection (a) of the missile for the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 
system, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that demonstration and 
validation of both competing systems can continue as needed to support 
an informed decision for such selection.
    (c) Funding for Certain Ballistic Missile RDT&E.--If a decision is 
not made before February 28, 1994, to proceed into the Engineering and 
Manufacturing Development stage under a weapon system program referred 
to in subsection (d), the funds appropriated pursuant to the 
authorization of appropriations in section 201 that are available for 
engineering and manufacturing development for such a program shall be 
available for research, development, test, and evaluation of the Patriot 
PAC-3 Missile program.
    (d) Covered Weapon System Programs.--For purposes of subsections (a) 
and (c), the weapon system programs referred to in this subsection are 
as follows:
        (1) The Patriot Multimode Missile Program.
        (2) The Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT) missile program.
    SEC. 234. COMPLIANCE OF BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND 
      COMPONENTS WITH ABM TREATY.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Section 232(a)(1) of the Missile Defense Act of 1991 (10 
    U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes a goal for the United States to comply 
    with the ABM Treaty (including any protocol or amendment thereto) 
    and not develop, test, or deploy any ballistic missile defense 
    system, or component thereof, in violation of that treaty (as 
    modified by any protocol or amendment thereto) while deploying an 
    anti-ballistic missile system capable of providing a highly 
    effective defense of the United States against limited attacks of 
    ballistic missiles.
        (2) The Department of Defense has conducted no formal compliance 
    review of any of the components or systems scheduled for early 
    deployment as part of either the Theater Missile Defense Initiative 
    or the initial limited defense system to be located at Grand Forks, 
    North Dakota.
        (3) The Department of Defense is continuing to obligate hundreds 
    of millions of dollars for the development and testing of systems or 
    components of ballistic missile defense systems before a 
    determination has been made that, if successfully developed, tested, 
    or deployed, those systems and components would be in compliance 
    with the ABM Treaty.
        (4) The President requested the authorization and appropriation 
    of additional funds for continued development of such systems and 
    components during fiscal year 1994.
        (5) The United States and its allies face existing and expanding 
    threats from ballistic missiles capable of being used as theater 
    weapon systems that are presently possessed by, being developed by, 
    or being acquired by a number of countries, including Iraq, Iran, 
    and North Korea.
        (6) Some theater ballistic missiles presently deployed or being 
    developed (such as the Chinese-made CSS-2) have capabilities equal 
    to or greater than the capabilities of missiles which were 
    determined to be strategic missiles more than 20 years ago under the 
    SALT I Interim Agreement of 1972 entered into between the United 
    States and the Soviet Union.
        (7) The ABM Treaty was not intended to, and does not, apply to 
    or limit research, development, testing, or deployment of missile 
    defense systems, system upgrades, or system components that are 
    designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles, regardless of 
    the capabilities of such missiles, unless those systems, system 
    upgrades, or system components are tested against or have 
    demonstrated capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic 
    missiles.
        (8) It is a national security priority of the United States to 
    develop and deploy highly effective theater missile defense systems 
    capable of countering the existing and expanding threats posed by 
    modern theater ballistic missiles as soon as is technically 
    possible.
        (9) It is essential that the Secretary of Defense immediately 
    undertake and complete a review for compliance with the ABM Treaty 
    of proposed theater missile defense systems, system upgrades, and 
    system components so as to not delay the development and deployment 
    of such highly effective theater missile defense systems.
    (b) Required Compliance Review.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall 
review the current baseline configuration of each system or system 
upgrade specified in paragraph (2), and the system components, to 
determine whether the development, testing, or deployment of that system 
or system upgrade would be in compliance with the ABM Treaty, including 
the interpretation of the Treaty set forth in the enclosure to the July 
13, 1993, ACDA letter.
    (2) The systems and system upgrades to be reviewed pursuant to 
paragraph (1) are the following:
        (A) The Patriot Multimode Missile.
        (B) The Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT).
        (C) The Ground-Based Radar for theater missile defenses (GBR-T).
        (D) The Theater High Altitude Area Defense interceptor missile 
    (THAAD).
        (E) The Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system.
        (F) Upgrades to the AEGIS/SPY radar system of the Navy.
        (G) Upgrades to the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptor of the 
    Navy.
    (3) If during the course of the compliance review under paragraph 
(1) (or any other such compliance review of a ballistic missile system 
or system upgrade), an issue arises that appears to indicate that a 
provision of the ABM Treaty may limit research, development, testing, or 
deployment by the United States of highly effective theater missile 
defense systems capable of countering modern theater ballistic missiles, 
the Secretary of Defense shall immediately submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report on that issue.
    (c) Report.--(1) For each system and system upgrade specified in 
paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the Secretary shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a report on the results of the 
review required by that subsection. A report may include the results of 
the reviews of more than one system and system upgrade. For any system 
or system upgrade determined not to be in compliance with the ABM 
Treaty, the Secretary shall indicate (A) what changes to the ABM Treaty 
would be required for the system to be deemed compliant with such 
modified ABM Treaty, and (B) what changes to the performance capability 
of the system or system upgrade would be required in order for it to 
become compliant with the existing Treaty, together with the effect of 
those performance capability changes on the effectiveness of the planned 
missile defense architecture.
    (2) With regard to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system, the 
Secretary shall include in the report findings on each of the following 
issues:
        (A) Whether the current baseline configuration of the Brilliant 
    Eyes space-based sensor system would comply with the ABM Treaty if 
    the system were used in conjunction with the planned ground-based 
    radar system and its ground-based interceptors at Grand Forks, North 
    Dakota.
        (B) If not, whether design changes or operational changes can be 
    made to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system that--
            (i) will result in the sensor system, when employed in 
        conjunction with the planned ground-based radar system and its 
        ground-based interceptors, being in compliance with the ABM 
        Treaty; and
            (ii) will not prevent the sensor system from performing its 
        strategic defense missions with a high degree of effectiveness.
        (C) If not, whether the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system 
    can be made, through design changes or operational changes, for use 
    only with theater missile defense systems and be in compliance with 
    the ABM Treaty.
        (D) If so, the extent to which deployment of the Brilliant Eyes 
    space-based sensor system would enhance the capability of upper-tier 
    theater defense systems and lower-tier theater defense systems, 
    respectively.
    (d) Limitations on Funding Pending Submission of Report.--(1) Not 
more than 50 percent of the funds reported pursuant to section 231(e) to 
be allocated for fiscal year 1994 for a system or system upgrade 
specified in subsection (b)(2) may be obligated for that system or 
system upgrade, or any of its components, until the Secretary completes 
the compliance review of such system or system upgrade required by 
subsection (b) and submits to the appropriate congressional committees 
the report on the results of the compliance review of that system or 
system upgrade as required by subsection (c).
    (2) Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 
1994, or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense from any 
funds appropriated for fiscal year 1994 or for any fiscal year before 
1994, may not be obligated or expended--
        (A) for any development or testing of anti-ballistic missile 
    systems or components except for development and testing consistent 
    with the interpretation of the ABM Treaty set forth in the enclosure 
    to the July 13, 1993, ACDA letter; or
        (B) for the acquisition of any material or equipment (including 
    long lead materials, components, piece parts, or test equipment, or 
    any modified space launch vehicle) required or to be used for the 
    development or testing of anti-ballistic missile systems or 
    components, except for material or equipment required for 
    development or testing consistent with the interpretation of the ABM 
    Treaty set forth in the enclosure to the July 13, 1993, ACDA letter.

    annual funding for the Limited Defense System averaging $600,000,000 
    per year.
        (4) The additional funding required and the additional time 
    required after fiscal year 1999 in order for initial deployment of a 
    limited, ABM-Treaty-compliant capability at a single site to be 
    implemented.
        (5) The variations in both required funding and required time 
    after fiscal year 1999 for the same initial deployment to be 
    implemented--
            (A) if funding for a Limited Defense System during fiscal 
        years 1995 through 1999 averages $750,000,000 per year; and
            (B) if funding for a Limited Defense System during fiscal

    to the development of a Limited Defense System.
        (8) The extent to which the testing and simulation 
    infrastructure, the level of engineering and technical support, the 
    extensive reliance on studies and analyses by contractors, and the 
    substantial use of outside contractors for systems engineering and 
    technical analysis which the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization 
    has inherited from the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization can 
    be reduced given the re-evaluation of the Ballistic Missile Defense 
    program that has emerged from the Bottom-Up Review of the Secretary 
    of Defense which was conducted during 1993.
        (9) Such other matters as the Secretary considers important.

    qualified to monitor the testing covered by the plan; and
        (B) are not assigned or detailed to, or otherwise performing 
    duties of, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and are 
    otherwise independent of such organization.
    (2) The monitoring group shall submit to the Secretary its analysis 
of, and conclusions regarding, the conduct and results of each test 
monitored by the group.

SEC. 238. ARROW TACTICAL ANTI-MISSILE PROGRAM.

    (a) Endorsement of Cooperative Research and Development.--Congress 
reiterates its endorsement (previously stated in section 225(a)(5) of 
Public Law 101-510 (104 Stat. 1515) and section 241(a) of Public Law 
102-190 (105 Stat. 1326)) of a continuing program of cooperative 
research and development, jointly funded by the United States and 
Israel, on the Arrow Tactical Anti-Missile program.
    (b) Program Goal.--The goal of the cooperative program is to 
demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the Arrow system and to 
permit the government of Israel to make a decision on its own initiative 
regarding deployment of that system without financial participation by 
the United States beyond the research and development stage.
    (c) Arrow Continuing Experiments.--The Secretary of Defense, from 
amounts appropriated to the Department of Defense pursuant to section 
201 for Defense-wide activities and available for the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization, shall fund the United States contribution to the 
fiscal year 1994 Arrow Continuing Experiments program in an amount not 
to exceed $56,400,000.
    (d) Arrow Deployability Initiative.--(1) Subject to paragraph (2), 
the Secretary of Defense may obligate funds appropriated pursuant to 
section 201 in an amount not to exceed $25,000,000 for the purpose of 
research and development of technologies associated with deploying the 
Arrow missile in the future (including technologies associated with 
battle management, lethality, system integration, and test bed systems).
    (2) Funds may not be obligated for the purpose stated in paragraph 
(1) (other than as required to satisfy the conditions set forth in this 
paragraph) unless the President certifies to Congress that--
        (A) the United States and the government of Israel have entered 
    into an agreement governing the conduct and funding of research and 
    development projects for the purpose stated in paragraph (1);
        (B) each project in which the United States will join under that 
    agreement (i) will have a benefit for the United States, and (ii) 
    has not been barred by other congressional direction;
        (C) the Arrow missile has successfully completed a flight test 
    in which it intercepted a target missile under realistic test 
    conditions; and
        (D) the government of Israel is continuing, in accordance with 
    its previous public commitments, to adhere to export controls 
    pursuant to the Guidelines and Annex of the Missile Technology 
    Control Regime.
    (e) Sense of Congress on Expediting Test Program.--It is the sense 
of Congress that, in order to expedite the test program for the Arrow 
missile, the United States should seek to initiate with the government 
of Israel discussions on the agreement referred to in subsection 
(d)(2)(A) without waiting for the condition specified in subsection 
(d)(2)(C) to be met first.

SEC. 239. REPORT ON ARROW TACTICAL ANTI-MISSILE PROGRAM.

    (a) Report Required.--Not later than April 1, 1994, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on

    Section 224 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Years 1990 and 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note) is amended--
        (1) by striking out ``Strategic Defense Initiative'' each place 
    it appears (other than in subsection (b)(5)) and inserting in lieu 
    thereof ``Ballistic Missile Defense program'';
        (2) by striking out ``Strategic Defense Initiative'' in 
    subsection (b)(5) and inserting in lieu thereof ``Ballistic Missile 
    Defense'';
        (3) by striking out ``SDI'' each place it appears and inserting 
    in lieu thereof ``BMD''; and
        (4) by striking out the section heading and inserting in lieu 
    thereof the following:
``SEC. 224. ANNUAL REPORT ON BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM.''.

SEC. 241. CLEMENTINE SATELLITE PROGRAM.

    (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that the program of the Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization that is known as the ``Clementine'' 
program, consisting of a satellite space project that will, among other 
matters, provide valuable information about asteroids in the vicinity of 
Earth, represents an important opportunity for transfer of Department of 
Defense technology for civilian purposes and should be supported.
    (b) Congressional Views.--The Congress urges the Secretary of 
Defense--
        (1) to identify an appropriate management structure within 
    either the Advanced Research Projects Agency or one of the military 
    departments to which the Clementine program and related programs of 
    general applicability to civilian, commercial, and military space 
    programs might be transferred; and
        (2) to consider funding for the Clementine program to be a 
    priority within whatever agency or department is identified as 
    described in paragraph (1) and to provide funds for that program at 
    an appropriate level.
    SEC. 242. COOPERATION OF UNITED STATES ALLIES ON DEVELOPMENT OF 
      TACTICAL AND THEATER MISSILE DEFENSES.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Systems to provide effective defense against theater and 
    tactical ballistic missiles that may be developed and deployed by 
    the United States have the potential to make contributions to the 
    national security interests of nations that are allies of the United 
    States that would be equal to or greater than the contributions such 
    systems would make to the national security interests of the United 
    States.
        (2) The cost of developing and deploying a broad spectrum of 
    such systems will be several tens of billions of dollars.
        (3) A truly cooperative multinational approach to the 
    development and deployment of such systems could substantially 
    reduce the financial burden of such an undertaking on any one 
    country and would involve additional sources of technological 
    expertise.
        (4) While leaders of nations that are allies of the United 
    States have stated an interest in becoming involved, or increasing 
    involvement, in United States tactical missile defense programs, the 
    governments of those nations are unlikely to support programs for 
    theater missile defense development and deployment unless, at a 
    minimum, they can participate in meaningful ways in the planning and 
    execution of such programs, including active participation in 
    research and development and production of the systems involved.
        (5) Given the high cost of developing theater ballistic missile 
    defense systems, the participation of United States allies in the 
    efforts to develop tactical missile defenses would result in 
    substantial savings to the United States.
    (b) Plan and Reports.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a 
plan to coordinate development and implementation of Theater Missile 
Defense programs of the United States with theater missile defense 
programs of United States allies, with the goal of avoiding duplication 
of effort, increasing interoperability, and reducing costs. The plan 
shall set forth in detail any financial, in-kind, or other form of 
participation by each nation in cooperative efforts to plan, develop, 
produce, and deploy theater ballistic missile defenses for the mutual 
benefit of the countries involved.
    (2) The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the plan 
developed under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted in both 
classified and unclassified versions, as appropriate, and may be 
submitted as a component of the next Theater Missile Defense Initiative 
report to Congress.
    (3) The Secretary shall include in each annual Theater Missile 
Defense Initiative report to Congress a report on actions taken to 
implement the plan developed under paragraph (1). Each such report shall 
set forth the status of discussions between the United States and United 
States allies for the purposes stated in that paragraph and shall state 
the status of contributions by those allies to the Theater Missile 
Defense Cooperation Account, shown separately for each allied country 
covered by the plan.
    (c) Restriction on Funds.--Of the total amount appropriated pursuant 
to authorizations in this Act for theater ballistic missile defense 
programs, not more than 80 percent may be obligated until--
        (1) the report under subsection (b)(2) is submitted to Congress; 
    and
        (2) the President certifies in writing to Congress that 
    representatives of the United States have formally submitted to each 
    of the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
    to Japan, Israel, and South Korea a proposal concerning the matters 
    described in the report.
The President may submit with such certification a report of similar 
formal contacts with any other country that the President considers 
appropriate.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that whenever 
the United States deploys theater ballistic missile defenses to protect 
another country, or the military forces of another country, that has not 
provided financial or in-kind support for development of theater 
ballistic missile defenses, the United States should consider whether it 
is appropriate to seek reimbursement from that country to cover at least 
the incremental cost to the United States of such deployment.
    (e) Allied Participation in TMD Programs.--Congress encourages 
allies of the United States, and particularly those allies that would 
benefit most from deployment of Theater Missile Defense systems, to 
participate in, or to increase participation in, cooperative Theater 
Missile Defense programs of the United States. Congress also encourages 
participation by the United States in cooperative theater missile 
defense efforts of allied nations as such programs emerge.
    (f) Fund for Allied Contributions.--(1) Chapter 155 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
section:
``§2609. Theater Missile Defense: acceptance of contributions from 
     allies; Theater Missile Defense Cooperation Account
    ``(a) Acceptance Authority.--The Secretary of Defense may accept 
from any allied foreign government or any international organization any 
contribution of money made by such foreign government or international 
organization for use by the Department of Defense for Theater Missile 
Defense programs.
    ``(b) Establishment of Theater Missile Defense Cooperation 
Account.--(1) There is established in the Treasury a special account to 
be known as the `Theater Missile Defense Cooperation Account'.
    ``(2) Contributions accepted by the Secretary of Defense under 
subsection (a) shall be credited to the Account.
    ``(c) Use of the Account.--Funds in the Account are hereby made 
available for obligation for research, development, test, and 
evaluation, and for procurement, for Theater Missile Defense programs of 
the Department of Defense.
    ``(d) Investment of Money.--(1) Upon request by the Secretary of 
Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury may invest money in the Account 
in securities of the United States or in securities guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by the United States.
    ``(2) Any interest or other income that accrues from investment in 
securities referred to in paragraph (1) shall be deposited to the credit 
of the Account.
    ``(e) Notification of Conditions.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
notify Congress of any condition imposed by the donor on the use of any 
contribution accepted by the Secretary under the authority of this 
section.
    ``(f) Annual Audit by GAO.--The Comptroller General of the United 
States shall conduct an annual audit of money accepted by the Secretary 
of Defense under this section and shall submit a copy of the results of 
each such audit to Congress.
    ``(g) Regulations.--The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe 
regulations to carry out this section.''.
    (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is 
amended by adding at the end the following new item:

``2609. Theater Missile Defense: acceptance of contributions from 
allies; Theater Missile Defense Cooperation Account.''.

SEC. 243. TRANSFER OF FOLLOW-ON TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS.

    SEC. 344. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN DEPOT-
      LEVEL WORK BY FOREIGN CONTRACTORS.
    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should not contract for the performance by a person 
or organization described in subsection (b) of any depot-level 
maintenance work on equipment located in the United States if the 
Secretary determines that the work could be performed in the United 
States on a cost-effective basis and without significant adverse effect 
on the readiness of the Armed Forces.
    (b) Covered Persons and Organizations.--A person or organization 
referred to in subsection (a) is a person or organization which is not 
part of the national technology and industrial base, as such term is 
defined in section 2491(1) of title 10, United States Code.
    SEC. 345. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ROLE OF DEPOT-LEVEL ACTIVITIES OF 
      THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The depot-level maintenance and repair activities of the 
    Department of Defense provide the Armed Forces with a critical 
    capacity to respond to the needs of the Armed Forces for depot-level 
    maintenance and repair of weapon systems and equipment.
        (2) The depot-level maintenance and repair activities of the 
    Department of Defense provide the Department with capabilities that 
    are uniquely suited to responding to the increased need for repair 
    and maintenance of weapon systems and equipment which may arise in 
    times of national crisis.
        (3) The skilled employees and equipment of the depot-level 
    maintenance and repair activities of the Department of Defense are 
    an essential component of the overall defense industrial base of the 
    United States.
        (4) The critical role of the depot-level maintenance and repair 
    activities of the Department of Defense is recognized in section 
    2466 of title 10, United States Code, which provides that the 
    Secretary of a military department and, with respect to a Defense 
    Agency, the Secretary of Defense, may not contract for the 
    performance by non-Federal Government personnel of more than 40 
    percent of the depot-level maintenance workload for the military 
    department or the Defense Agency.
        (5) Maintenance of this critical industrial capability in the 
    Department of Defense requires that an appropriate level of the 
    depot-level maintenance and repair of new weapon systems be assigned 
    to depot-level maintenance and repair activities of the Department 
    of Defense.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that, in 
order to maintain the critical depot-level maintenance and repair 
capability for military weapon systems and equipment, the Secretary of 
Defense shall, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that a 
sufficient amount of the depot-level maintenance and repair of new 
weapon systems and equipment is assigned to depot-level maintenance and 
repair activities of the Department of Defense, consistent with the 
requirements of section 2466 of title 10, United States Code.

change under subsection (a).''.

    spouse, such compensation shall be paid to each such dependent child 
    of the former member who does not reside in that household.

resulting in a punitive or other adverse action described in subsection

    (a) Codification.--(1) Chapter 37 of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``§654. Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces
    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        ``(1) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United 
    States commits exclusively to the Congress the powers to raise and 
    support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make rules for the 
    government and regulation of the land and naval forces.
        ``(2) There is no constitutional right to serve in the armed 
    forces.
        ``(3) Pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of article I 
    of the Constitution of the United States, it lies within the 
    discretion of the Congress to establish qualifications for and 
    conditions of service in the armed forces.
        ``(4) The primary purpose of the armed forces is to prepare for 
    and to prevail in combat should the need arise.
        ``(5) The conduct of military operations requires members of the 
    armed forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including the 
    ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common defense.
        ``(6) Success in combat requires military units that are 
    characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit 
    cohesion.
        ``(7) One of the most critical elements in combat capability is 
    unit cohesion, that is, the bonds of trust among individual service 
    members that make the combat effectiveness of a military unit 
    greater than the sum of the combat effectiveness of the individual 
    unit members.
        ``(8) Military life is fundamentally different from civilian 
    life in that--
            ``(A) the extraordinary responsibilities of the armed 
        forces, the unique conditions of military service, and the 
        critical role of unit cohesion, require that the military 
        community, while subject to civilian control, exist as a 
        specialized society; and
            ``(B) the military society is characterized by its own laws, 
        rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous restrictions 
        on personal behavior, that would not be acceptable in civilian 
        society.
        ``(9) The standards of conduct for members of the armed forces 
    regulate a member's life for 24 hours each day beginning at the 
    moment the member enters military status and not ending until that 
    person is discharged or otherwise separated from the armed forces.
        ``(10) Those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code of 
    Military Justice, apply to a member of the armed forces at all times 
    that the member has a military status, whether the member is on base 
    or off base, and whether the member is on duty or off duty.
        ``(11) The pervasive application of the standards of conduct is 
    necessary because members of the armed forces must be ready at all 
    times for worldwide deployment to a combat environment.
        ``(12) The worldwide deployment of United States military 
    forces, the international responsibilities of the United States, and 
    the potential for involvement of the armed forces in actual combat 
    routinely make it necessary for members of the armed forces 
    involuntarily to accept living conditions and working conditions 
    that are often spartan, primitive, and characterized by forced 
    intimacy with little or no privacy.
        ``(13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a 
    longstanding element of military law that continues to be necessary 
    in the unique circumstances of military service.
        ``(14) The armed forces must maintain personnel policies that 
    exclude persons whose presence in the armed forces would create an 
    unacceptable risk to the armed forces' high standards of morale, 
    good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of 
    military capability.
        ``(15) The presence in the armed forces of persons who 
    demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts 
    would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, 
    good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of 
    military capability.
    ``(b) Policy.--A member of the armed forces shall be separated from 
the armed forces under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
Defense if one or more of the following findings is made and approved in 
accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations:
        ``(1) That the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or 
    solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts unless there 
    are further findings, made and approved in accordance with 
    procedures set forth in such regulations, that the member has 
    demonstrated that--
            ``(A) such conduct is a departure from the member's usual 
        and customary behavior;
            ``(B) such conduct, under all the circumstances, is unlikely 
        to recur;
            ``(C) such conduct was not accomplished by use of force, 
        coercion, or intimidation;
            ``(D) under the particular circumstances of the case, the 
        member's continued presence in the armed forces is consistent 
        with the interests of the armed forces in proper discipline, 
        good order, and morale; and
            ``(E) the member does not have a propensity or intent to 
        engage in homosexual acts.
        ``(2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual 
    or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further 
    finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth 
    in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she 
    is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a 
    propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.
        ``(3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a person 
    known to be of the same biological sex.
    ``(c) Entry Standards and Documents.--(1) The Secretary of Defense 
shall ensure that the standards for enlistment and appointment of 
members of the armed forces reflect the policies set forth in subsection 
(b).
    ``(2) The documents used to effectuate the enlistment or appointment 
of a person as a member of the armed forces shall set forth the 
provisions of subsection (b).
    ``(d) Required Briefings.--The briefings that members of the armed 
forces receive upon entry into the armed forces and periodically 
thereafter under section 937 of this title (article 137 of the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice) shall include a detailed explanation of the 
applicable laws and regulations governing sexual conduct by members of 
the armed forces, including the policies prescribed under subsection 
(b).
    ``(e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (b) shall be 
construed to require that a member of the armed forces be processed for 
separation from the armed forces when a determination is made in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense 
that--
        ``(1) the member engaged in conduct or made statements for the 
    purpose of avoiding or terminating military service; and
        ``(2) separation of the member would not be in the best interest 
    of the armed forces.
    ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:
        ``(1) The term `homosexual' means a person, regardless of sex, 
    who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage 
    in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts, and includes the terms 
    `gay' and `lesbian'.
        ``(2) The term `bisexual' means a person who engages in, 
    attempts to engage in, has a propensity to engage in, or intends to 
    engage in homosexual and heterosexual acts.
        ``(3) The term `homosexual act' means--
            ``(A) any bodily contact, actively undertaken or passively 
        permitted, between members of the same sex for the purpose of 
        satisfying sexual desires; and
            ``(B) any bodily contact which a reasonable person would 
        understand to demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in an 
        act described in subparagraph (A).''.
    (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``654. Policy concerning homosexuality in the armed forces.''.

    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall revise Department of Defense 
regulations, and issue such new regulations as may be necessary, to

subsection (a).
    (c) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this section or section 654 of 
title 10, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), may be 
construed to invalidate any inquiry, investigation, administrative 
action or proceeding, court-martial, or judicial proceeding conducted 
before the effective date of regulations issued by the Secretary of 
Defense to implement such section 654.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the suspension of questioning concerning homosexuality as 
    part of the processing of individuals for accession into the Armed 
    Forces under the interim policy of January 29, 1993, should be 
    continued, but the Secretary of Defense may reinstate that 
    questioning with such questions or such revised questions as he 
    considers appropriate if the Secretary determines that it is 
    necessary to do so in order to effectuate the policy set forth in 
    section 654 of title 10, United States Code, as added by subsection 
    (a); and
        (2) the Secretary of Defense should consider issuing guidance 
    governing the circumstances under which members of the Armed Forces 
    questioned about homosexuality for administrative purposes should be 
    afforded warnings similar to the warnings under section 831(b) of 
    title 10, United States Code (article 31(b) of the Uniform Code of 
    Military Justice).

that a person who entered into an agreement under this section failed to 
complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement (or failed 
to fulfill any other term or condition prescribed in the agreement) and, 
by reason of the provision of the agreement required under subsection 
(a)(3), may owe a debt to the United States and in which that person 
disputes that such a debt is owed, the Secretary shall designate a 
member of the armed forces or a civilian employee under the jurisdiction 
of the Secretary to investigate the facts of the case and hear evidence 
presented by the person who may owe the debt and other parties, as 
appropriate, in order to determine the validity of the debt. That 
official shall report the official's findings and recommendations to the 
Secretary concerned. If the justification for the debt investigated 
includes an allegation of misconduct, the investigating official shall 
state in the report the official's assessment as to whether the 
individual behavior that resulted in the separation of the person who 
may owe the debt qualifies as misconduct under subsection (a)(3).
    ``(2) The Secretary of each military department shall ensure that a 
member of the armed forces who may be subject to a reimbursement 
requirement under this section is advised of such requirement before (1) 
submitting a request for voluntary separation, or (2) making a decision 
on a course of action regarding personal involvement in administrative, 
nonjudicial, and judicial action resulting from alleged misconduct.
    ``(h) The Secretary concerned may, at any time before October 1, 
1998, modify an agreement described in subsection (a) to reduce the 
active duty service obligation specified in the agreement if the 
Secretary determines that it is in the best interests of the United 
States to do so. In such a case, the Secretary shall reduce the amount 
required to be reimbursed to the United States proportionately with the 
reduction in the period of obligated active duty service.''.

recommendations of--
        (1) the June 1993 inspection report of the Inspector General of 
    the Department of Defense on the Defense Foreign Language Program 
    (report numbered 93-INS-10);

    and reserve components from a Total Force perspective.
        (2) Improvement of linguist training programs, both resident and 
    nonresident, to provide greater flexibility, to accommodate missions 
    other than signals intelligence, and to improve the provision of 
    resources for nonresident programs.
        (3) Centralized responsibility within the Office of the 
    Secretary of Defense to provide coordinated oversight of all foreign 
    language issues and programs, including a centralized process for 
    determination, validation, and documentation of foreign language 
    requirements for different services and missions.
        (4) Revised policies of each of the military departments to 
    foster maintenance of highly perishable linguistic skills through 
    improved management of the careers of language-trained personnel, 
    including more effective use of language skills, improved career 
    opportunities within the linguistics field, and specific linkage of 
    language proficiency to promotions.
        (5) In the case of language-trained members of the reserve 
    components--
            (A) the use of additional training assemblies (ATAs) as a 
        means of sustaining linguistic proficiency and enhancing 
        retention; and
            (B) the use of larger enlistment and reenlistment bonuses, 
        Special Duty Assignment Pay, and educational incentives.
        (6) Such other management changes as the Secretary may consider 
    necessary.
    (c) Evaluation of Adjustment in Foreign Language Proficiency Pay.--
(1) The Secretary shall include in the test program an evaluation of

        requirements process for foreign language programs.
            (iii) Inadequate uniform career management of language-
        trained personnel, including failure to take sufficient 
        advantage of language skills and to recoup investment of 
        training dollars.
            (iv) Inadequate training programs, both resident and 
        nonresident.
        (B) The current manning of linguistic billets (shown by service,

            (ii) for five years, if those rates are subsequently applied 
        to the entire Department of Defense.
    (3) The rates for adjusted foreign language proficiency pay as 
proposed to be paid for the test program under paragraph (1) may not 
take effect for the test program unless the senior official responsible 
for personnel matters in the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
determines that--
        (A) the foreign language proficiency pay levels established for 
    the test program are consistent with proficiency pay levels for 
    other functions throughout the Department of Defense; and

    (2) For purposes of paragraph (1), days on which either House is not 
in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day

    request for consideration for such credit.

incorrect.
    (B) In the case of an officer described in paragraph (2)(B), joint 
duty credit may be granted by reason of this subsection only if the

Defense shall ensure that each officer with the joint specialty who 
graduates from a joint professional military education school shall be

    Subtitle E--Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces

SEC. 951. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The current allocation of roles and missions among the Armed 
    Forces evolved from the practice during World War II to meet the 
    Cold War threat and may no longer be appropriate for the post-Cold 
    War era.
        (2) Many analysts believe that a realignment of those roles and 
    mission is essential for the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
    Armed Forces, particularly in light of lower budgetary resources 
    that will be available to the Department of Defense in the future.
        (3) The existing process of a triennial review of roles and 
    missions by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pursuant to 
    provisions of law enacted by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of 
    Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 has not produced the 
    comprehensive review envisioned by Congress.
        (4) It is difficult for any organization, and may be 
    particularly difficult for the Department of Defense, to reform 
    itself without the benefit and authority provided by external 
    perspectives and analysis.

SEC. 952. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.

    (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established a commission to be 
known as the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces

    (a) In General.--The Commission shall--
        (1) review the efficacy and appropriateness for the post-Cold 
    War era of the current allocations among the Armed Forces of roles,

        (2) evaluate and report on alternative allocations of those 
    roles, missions, and functions; and
        (3) make recommendations for changes in the current definition 
    and distribution of those roles, missions, and functions.
    (b) Review of Potential Military Operations.--The Commission shall 
review the types of military operations that may be required in the 
post-Cold War era, taking into account the requirements for success in 
various types of operations. As part of such review, the Commission

Department of Defense. The types of operations to be considered by the 
Commission as part of such review shall include the following:
        (1) Defense of the United States.
        (2) Warfare against other national military forces.
        (3) Participation in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and other

    (d) Development of Conceptual Framework for Organizational 
Allocations.--The Commission shall develop a conceptual framework for 
the review of the organizational allocation among the Armed Forces of 
military roles, missions, and functions. In developing that framework, 
the Commission shall consider--
        (1) static efficiency (such as duplicative overhead and 
    economies of scale);
        (2) dynamic effectiveness (including the benefits of competition 
    and the effect on innovation);
        (3) interoperability, responsiveness, and other aspects of 
    military effectiveness in the field;
        (4) gaps in mission coverage and so-called orphan missions that 
    are inadequately served by existing organizational entities;
        (5) division of responsibility on the battlefield;
        (6) exploitation of new technology and operational concepts;
        (7) the degree of disruption that a change in roles and missions 
    would entail; and
        (8) the experience of other nations.
    (e) Recommendations Concerning Military Roles and Missions.--Based 
upon the conceptual framework developed under subsection (d) to evaluate 
possible changes to the existing allocation among the Armed Forces of 
military roles, missions, and functions, the Commission shall 
recommend--
        (1) the functions for which each military department should 
    organize, train, and equip forces;
        (2) the missions of combatant commands; and
        (3) the roles that Congress should assign to the various 
    military elements of the Department of Defense.
    (f) Recommendations Concerning Civilian Elements of Department of 
Defense.--The Commission may address the roles, missions, and functions 
of civilian portions of the Department of Defense and other national 
security agencies to the extent that changes in these areas are 
collateral to changes considered in military roles, missions, and 
functions.
    (g) Recommendations Concerning Process for Future Changes.--The 
Commission shall also recommend a process for continuing to adapt the 
roles, missions, and functions of the Armed Forces to future changes in 
technology and in the international security environment.

SEC. 954. REPORTS.

discussions with the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and the chairmen of those committees.

of Defense as a National Contingency Operation. Whenever the Secretary 
designates an operation as a National Contingency Operation, the

the Department of Defense mechanisms by which funds are provided for 
operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some 
other authority.
    ``(b) Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units.--(1) When an 
operating unit of the armed forces participating in a National 
Contingency Operation receives support services from a support unit of 
the armed forces that operates through the Defense Business Operations 
Fund (or a successor fund), that operating unit need not reimburse that 
support unit for the incremental costs incurred by the support unit in 
providing such support, notwithstanding any other provision of law or 
Government accounting practice.

be reimbursed to a support unit shall be recorded as an expense 
attributable to the operation and shall be accounted for separately.

Contingency Operations may not exceed $300,000,000 at any one time.

obtain funds for the full cost to the United States of the operation.

make the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund) whole 
again.
    ``(d) Incremental Costs.--For purposes of this section, incremental 
costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the 
costs that are directly attributable to the operation and that are 
otherwise chargeable to accounts available for operation and maintenance 
or for military personnel. Any costs which are otherwise chargeable to 
accounts available for procurement may not be considered to be 
incremental costs for purposes of this section.

established in the Department of Defense a reserve fund to be known as

shall be available for incremental military personnel costs attributable 
to a National Contingency Operation. Amounts in the fund remain 
available until expended.

be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution. This 
section does not provide authority to conduct a National Contingency 
Operation or any other operation.

States shall from time to time, and when requested by a committee of 
Congress, conduct a review of the defense contingency funding structure 
under this section to determine whether the Department of Defense is 
complying with the requirements and limitations of this section.

Operation' means a military operation that is designated by the

SEC. 1155. REPORT ON FOOD SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The Defense Personnel Support Center, a component of the 
    Defense Logistics Agency, purchases more than 90 percent of the food 
    supplied to military end-users, including dining halls, hospitals, 
    and other facilities that feed troops.
        (2) Semiperishable items, such as canned goods, are stored in 
    four depots of the Defense Logistics Agency, and perishable items, 
    including fresh and frozen vegetables, fruits, and meats, are stored 
    in 21 contractor-operated Defense Subsistence Offices.
        (3) Private sector end-users, including independent restaurants, 
    hospitals, and hotels, obtain food through direct delivery from 
    commercial distributors of food.
        (4) In a comprehensive inventory reduction plan issued in May 
    1990, the Secretary of Defense concluded that there was no benefit 
    to using the food supply system of the Department of Defense in 
    circumstances in which the food requirements of the Department could 
    be met through the use of commercial distributors of food.
        (5) In a report published in June 1993, the General Accounting 
    Office determined that the Department of Defense could achieve 
    substantial cost savings by expanding the use of commercial 
    distributors of food and related commercial practices in the food 
    supply system of the Department.
    (b) Review.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a review of the 
food supply and distribution practices of the Department of Defense. The 
review shall include the following:
        (1) An evaluation of the feasibility of, and the economic 
    advantages and disadvantages of, the expanded use of full-line 
    commercial distributors of food to deliver food directly to military 
    end-users.
        (2) An evaluation of the potential for the expanded use of such 
    commercial distributors to reduce the need for the storage of food 
    (except for war reserve stocks and items bound for overseas) 
    directly by the Department of Defense and to eliminate the 
    requirement for Defense Subsistence Offices and certain warehouse 
    activities at military installations.
        (3) A comparison of the cost of using the Department of Defense 
    food supply and distribution system to meet the Department of 
    Defense food requirements with the cost of using commercial 
    distributors of food to meet such requirements.
        (4) A consideration of any obstacles that would hinder the 
    ability of the Department of Defense to procure commercial food 
    items and to institute commercial practices with respect to food 
    supply and distribution.
    (c) Report.--Not later than March 1, 1994, the Secretary shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the findings, 
conclusions, and recommendations of the Secretary as a result of the 
review conducted under subsection (b).
    Subtitle G--Congressional Findings, Policies, Commendations, and 
                             Commemorations
SEC. 1161. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE 
EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY (ELF) COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) There is a need to re-evaluate all defense spending in light 
    of the changed circumstances of the post-Cold War era and budget and 
    fiscal constraints.
        (2) The Extremely Low Frequency Communications System (ELF 
    System) was originally designed to play a role in the strategic 
    deterrence mission against the former Soviet Union.
        (3) The threat of nuclear war has greatly diminished since the 
    collapse of the Soviet Union.
        (4) The ELF System is increasingly in use for communications 
    with attack submarines in addition to ballistic missile submarines.
        (5) There have been questions raised about the effects of ELF 
    operations on human health and the environment and ongoing studies 
    of those effects are due to be concluded during 1994.
    (b) Evaluation and Report by Secretary of Defense.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees, before 
consideration by Congress of the fiscal year 1995 defense budget, a 
report containing the results of an evaluation of the benefits and costs 
of continued operation of the Extremely Low Frequency Communications 
System and the benefits and costs of any alternatives to that system. 
The report shall be based upon an evaluation conducted by the Secretary 
after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the bases 
at which the Extremely Low Frequency Communication System is located, 
having been considered for closure or realignment in the 1993 base 
closure process, should again be considered for closure or realignment 
in the round of military base closures to take place in 1995.
SEC. 1162. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF NAVAL 
OCEANOGRAPHIC SURVEY AND RESEARCH IN THE POST-COLD WAR PERIOD.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Oceanographic research and survey work is a critical element 
    to the ability of the Navy to conduct successful operations in 
    littoral waters of the world.
        (2) Over the five-year period of fiscal years 1989 through 1993, 
    the Navy experienced a significant diminution in its oceanographic 
    research and survey capability due to budget reductions that 
    resulted in (A) a reduction in the level of effort for Navy 
    oceanographic research and survey activities by almost 50 percent, 
    and (B) a reduction from 12 to 7 in the number of Navy ships 
    dedicated to oceanographic survey and research activities.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) reductions in the funding, activities, and capability of the 
    Navy to conduct oceanographic survey and research work, in addition 
    to the reductions referred to in subsection (a)(2), would further 
    reduce the level of oceanographic survey and research work of the 
    Navy and should be avoided; and
        (2) funding for oceanographic survey and research activities of 
    the Navy should be maintained at levels sufficient to ensure that 
    the Navy can exploit every opportunity to survey and research 
    littoral waters critical to the operational needs of the Navy.
SEC. 1163. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES POLICY ON 
PLUTONIUM.
    (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that reprocessing spent nuclear 
fuel referred to in subsection (c) to recover plutonium may pose serious 
environmental hazards and increase the risk of proliferation of weapons-
usable plutonium.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
President should take action to encourage the reduction or cessation of 
the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel referred to in subsection (c) to 
recover plutonium until the environmental and proliferation concerns 
related to such reprocessing are resolved.
    (c) Covered Spent Nuclear Fuel.--The spent nuclear fuel referred to 
in subsections (a) and (b) is spent nuclear fuel used in a commercial 
nuclear power reactor by the Government of a foreign country or by a 
foreign-owned or foreign-controlled entity.
SEC. 1164. SENSE OF SENATE ON ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN 
FORMER MEMBERS OF THE IRAQI ARMED FORCES.
    It is the sense of the Senate that no person who was a member of the 
armed forces of Iraq during the period from August 2, 1990, through 
February 28, 1991, and who is in a refugee camp in Saudi Arabia as of 
the date of enactment of this Act should be granted entry into the 
United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act unless the 
President certifies to Congress before such entry that such person--
        (1) assisted the United States or coalition armed forces after 
    defection from the armed forces of Iraq or after capture by the 
    United States or coalition armed forces; and
        (2) did not commit or assist in the commission of war crimes.
SEC. 1165. U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS MEMORIAL, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On July 30, 1945, during the closing days of World War II, 
    the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) was sunk as a result of a torpedo 
    attack on that ship.
        (2) The memorial to the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) to be 
    located on the east bank of the Indianapolis water canal in downtown 
    Indianapolis, Indiana, will honor the personal sacrifice of the 
    1,197 servicemen who were aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) on 
    that day, 881 of whom died as one of the greatest single combat 
    losses suffered by the United States Navy in World War II.
        (3) The memorial will pay fitting tribute to that gallant ship 
    and her final crew and will forever commemorate the place of the 
    U.S.S. Indianapolis in United States Navy history as the last major 
    ship lost in World War II.
        (4) The memorial to the U.S.S. Indianapolis symbolizes the 
    devoted service of the United States Navy and Marine Corps 
    personnel, particularly those who lost their lives at sea in the 
    Pacific Theater during World War II, whose dedication and sacrifice 
    in the cause of liberty and freedom were instrumental in the triumph 
    of the United States and its allies in that war.
        (5) The citizens of the United States have a continuing 
    obligation to educate future generations about the military and 
    other historic endeavors of the United States.
    (b) Recognition as a National Memorial.--The memorial to the U.S.S. 
Indianapolis (CA-35) in Indianapolis, Indiana, is hereby recognized as 
the national memorial to the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) and to the 
final crew of that historic warship.

Defense receives such notice, the Secretary of Defense may disapprove 
the loan guarantee based on the assessment of the Secretary of the 
potential use of the vessel in a manner that may cause harm to United 
States national security interests. The Secretary of Defense may not 
disapprove a loan guarantee under this section solely on the basis of

section may not be delegated to any official other than a civilian 
officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President, by and

         TITLE XIV--MATTERS RELATING TO ALLIES AND OTHER NATIONS
                   Subtitle A--Defense Burden Sharing

SEC. 1401. DEFENSE BURDENS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Since fiscal year 1985, the budget of the Department of 
    Defense has declined by 34 percent in constant fiscal year 1985 
    dollars.
        (2) During the past few years, the United States military 
    presence overseas has declined significantly in the following ways:
            (A) Since fiscal year 1986, the number of United States 
        military personnel permanently stationed overseas has declined 
        by almost 200,000.
            (B) From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 1994, spending by 
        the United States to support the stationing of United States 
        military forces overseas will have declined by 36 percent.
            (C) Since January 1990, the Department of Defense has 
        announced the closure, reduction, or transfer to standby status 
        of 840 United States military facilities overseas, which is 
        approximately a 50 percent reduction in the number of such 
        facilities.
        (3) The United States military presence overseas will continue 
    to decline as a result of actions by the executive branch and as a 
    result of the following provisions of law:
            (A) Section 1302 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1993, which requires a 40 percent reduction by 
        September 30, 1996, in the number of United States military 
        personnel permanently stationed ashore in overseas locations.
            (B) Section 1303 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1993, which provides that no more than 100,000 
        United States military personnel may be permanently stationed 
        ashore in NATO member countries after September 30, 1996.
            (C) Section 1301 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1993, which reduced the spending proposed by the 
        Department of Defense for overseas basing activities during 
        fiscal year 1993 by $500,000,000.
            (D) Sections 913 and 915 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, which directed 
        the President to develop a plan to gradually reduce the United 
        States military force structure in East Asia.
        (4) The East Asia Strategy Initiative, which was developed in 
    response to sections 913 and 915 of the National Defense 
    Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, has resulted in 
    the withdrawal of 12,000 United States military personnel from Japan 
    and the Republic of Korea since fiscal year 1990.
        (5) In response to actions by the executive branch and the 
    Congress, allied countries in which United States military personnel 
    are stationed and alliances in which the United States participates 
    have agreed to reduce the costs incurred by the United States in 
    basing military forces overseas in the following ways:
            (A) Under the 1991 Special Measures Agreement between Japan 
        and the United States, Japan will pay by 1995 almost all yen-
        denominated costs of stationing United States military personnel 
        in Japan.
            (B) The Republic of Korea has agreed to pay by 1995 one-
        third of the won-based costs incurred by the United States in 
        stationing United States military personnel in the Republic of 
        Korea.
            (C) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed 
        that the NATO Infrastructure Program will adapt to support post-
        Cold War strategy and could pay the annual operation and 
        maintenance costs of facilities in Europe and the United States 
        that would support the reinforcement of Europe by United States 
        military forces and the participation of United States military 
        forces in peacekeeping and conflict prevention operations.
            (D) Such allied countries and alliances have agreed to share 
        more fully the responsibilities and burdens of providing for 
        mutual security and stability through steps such as the 
        following:
                (i) The Republic of Korea has assumed the leadership 
            role regarding ground combat forces for the defense of the 
            Republic of Korea.
                (ii) NATO has adopted the new mission of conducting 
            peacekeeping operations and is, for example, providing land, 
            sea, and air forces for United Nations efforts in the former 
            Yugoslavia.
                (iii) The countries of western Europe are contributing 
            substantially to the development of democracy, stability, 
            and open market societies in eastern Europe and the former 
            Soviet Union.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the forward presence of United States military personnel 
    stationed overseas continues to be important to United States 
    security interests;
        (2) that forward presence facilitates efforts to pursue United 
    States security interests on a collective basis rather than pursuing 
    them on a far more costly unilateral basis or receding into 
    isolationism;
        (3) the bilateral and multilateral arrangements and alliances in 
    which that forward presence plays a part must be further adapted to 
    the security environment of the post-Cold War period;
        (4) the cost-sharing percentages for the NATO Infrastructure 
    Program should be reviewed with the aim of reflecting current 
    economic, political, and military realities and thus reducing the 
    United States cost-sharing percentage; and
        (5) the amounts obligated to conduct United States overseas 
    basing activities should decline significantly in fiscal year 1994 
    and in future fiscal years as--
            (A) the number of United States military personnel stationed 
        overseas continues to decline; and
            (B) the countries in which United States military personnel 
        are stationed and the alliances in which the United States 
        participates assume an increased share of United States overseas 
        basing costs.
    (c) Reducing United States Overseas Basing Costs.--(1) In order to 
achieve additional savings in overseas basing costs, the President 
should--
        (A) continue with the reductions in United States military 
    presence overseas as required by sections 1302 and 1303 of the 
    National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993; and
        (B) intensify efforts to negotiate a more favorable host-nation 
    agreement with each foreign country to which this paragraph applies 
    under paragraph (3)(A).
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a more favorable host-nation 
agreement is an agreement under which such foreign country--
        (A) assumes an increased share of the costs of United States 
    military installations in that country, including the costs of--
            (i) labor, utilities, and services;
            (ii) military construction projects and real property 
        maintenance;
            (iii) leasing requirements associated with the United States 
        military presence; and
            (iv) actions necessary to meet local environmental 
        standards;
        (B) relieves the United States of all tax liability that, with 
    respect to forces located in that country, is incurred by the Armed 
    Forces of the United States under the laws of that country and the 
    laws of the community where those forces are located; and
        (C) ensures that goods and services furnished in that country to 
    the Armed Forces of the United States are provided at minimum cost 
    and without imposition of user fees.
    (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(B) 
applies with respect to--
        (i) each country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
    (other than the United States); and
        (ii) each other foreign country with which the United States has 
    a bilateral or multilateral defense agreement that provides for the 
    assignment of combat units of the Armed Forces of the United States 
    to permanent duty in that country or the placement of combat 
    equipment of the United States in that country.
    (B) Paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to--
        (i) a foreign country that receives assistance under section 23 
    of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) (relating to the 
    foreign military financing program) or under the provisions of 
    chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
    U.S.C. 2346 et seq.); or
        (ii) a foreign country that has agreed to assume, not later than 
    September 30, 1996, at least 75 percent of the nonpersonnel costs of 
    United States military installations in the country.
    (d) Obligational Limitation.--(1) The total amount appropriated to 
the Department of Defense for Military Personnel, for Operation and 
Maintenance, and for military construction (including construction and 
improvement of military family housing) that is obligated to conduct 
overseas basing activities during fiscal year 1994 may not exceed 
$16,915,400,000 (such amount being the amount appropriated for such 
purposes for fiscal year 1993 reduced by $3,300,000,000), except to the 
extent provided by the Secretary of Defense under paragraph (3).
    (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``overseas basing 
activities'' means the activities of the Department of Defense for which 
funds are provided through appropriations for Military Personnel, for 
Operation and Maintenance (including appropriations for family housing 
operations), and for military construction (including construction and 
improvement of military family housing) for the payment of costs for 
Department of Defense overseas military units and the costs for all 
dependents who accompany Department of Defense personnel outside the 
United States.
    (3) The Secretary of Defense may increase the amount of the 
limitation under paragraph (1) by such amount or amounts as the 
Secretary determines to be necessary in the national interest, but not 
to exceed a total increase of $582,700,000. The Secretary may not 
increase the amount of such limitation under the preceding sentence 
until the Secretary provides notice to Congress of the Secretary's 
intent to authorize such an increase and a period of 15 days elapses 
after the day on which such notice is provided.
    (e) Allocations of Savings.--Any amounts appropriated to the 
Department of Defense for fiscal year 1994 for the purposes covered by 
subsection (d)(1) that are not available to be used for those purposes 
by reason of the limitation in that subsection shall be allocated by the 
Secretary of Defense for operation and maintenance and for military 
construction activities of the Department of Defense at military 
installations and facilities located inside the United States.
SEC. 1402. BURDEN SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND 
REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.
    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 138 of title 10, United

             Subtitle B--North Atlantic Treaty Organization
SEC. 1411. FINDINGS, SENSE OF CONGRESS, AND REPORT REQUIREMENT 
CONCERNING NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has 
    successfully met the challenge of helping to maintain the peace, 
    security, and freedom of the United States and its NATO allies for 
    more than 40 years.
        (2) The national security interests of the United States have 
    been well served by the process of consultation, coordination, and 
    military cooperation in the NATO framework.
        (3) Recent history has witnessed radical changes in the 
    international security environment, including the fall of the Berlin 
    Wall, the unification of Germany, the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact 
    and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
        (4) The military threats which NATO was established to deter 
    have greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War.
        (5) The post-Cold War security situation continues to present a 
    wide array of challenges to United States national interests, many 
    of which interests the United States shares with its allies in 
    Europe and Canada.
        (6) The international community may prove capable of deterring 
    many threats to the common peace if it can respond decisively to 
    aggression.
        (7) The United States must share the responsibilities and the 
    burdens of pursuing international security and stability with other 
    nations.
        (8) Several of the newly democratic nations of Central and 
    Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have expressed interest 
    in seeking membership in NATO.
        (9) Many of the security challenges facing the post-Cold War 
    world would be best handled through coherent multilateral responses.
        (10) The United States should never send its military forces 
    into combat unless they are provided with the best opportunity to 
    accomplish their objectives with as little risk as possible.
        (11) Military interventions against antagonistic armed forces 
    cannot be conducted safely or effectively on a multilateral basis 
    unless such operations are jointly planned in advance and are 
    executed by units which have trained together and are familiar with 
    each others' operational procedures.
        (12) NATO is currently the only organization with the 
    experience, trained staff, and infrastructure necessary to support 
    military cooperation with the major military allies of the United 
    States.
        (13) The NATO allies already have volunteered to consider 
    requests from the United Nations and the Conference on Security and 
    Cooperation in Europe for assistance in maintaining the peace.
        (14) Justification of the relevance of NATO in the post-Cold War 
    world will depend largely upon the alliance's ability to adapt its 
    mission, area of responsibility, and procedures to the new security 
    environment.
        (15) Justification of future United States support for the 
    alliance and for a United States military presence in Europe will 
    depend upon NATO's ability to address those security interests which 
    the United States shares with its allies in Europe and Canada.
        (16) The meeting of the NATO heads of state scheduled for 
    January 1994, presents an excellent opportunity for the President to 
    articulate a new, broader security mission for the alliance in the 
    post-Cold War world, one which will enable it to address a wider 
    array of threats to its members' interests and which will help to 
    share more effectively the burden of international security 
    requirements.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
        (1) old threats to the security of the United States and its 
    allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization having greatly 
    diminished, and new, more diverse challenges having arisen 
    (including ethno-religious conflict in Central and Eastern Europe 
    and the former Soviet Union and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
    destruction in regions proximate to alliance territory), NATO's 
    mission must be redefined so that it may respond to such challenges 
    to its members' security even when those challenges emanate from 
    beyond the geographic boundaries of its members' territories;
        (2) NATO should review its consultative mechanisms in order to 
    maximize its ability to marshal political, diplomatic, social, and 
    economic solidarity, buttressed by credible military capability, and 
    to bring the full weight and scope of its cooperative efforts to 
    bear in addressing the new challenges; and
        (3) future United States military involvement in, and 
    contributions to, NATO should be determined in relation to the 
    alliance's success or failure in adapting itself to confronting the 
    challenges of the post-Cold War world.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the President shall transmit a report to the Committee on 
Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and 
the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives. The report shall contain recommendations 
on the following:
        (1) The manner in which NATO can formulate and implement a 
    strategy to address the new, more disparate threats to the security 
    of its members.
        (2) The manner in which NATO should continue to adapt its 
    consultative process, including efforts to extend that process to 
    the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former 
    Soviet Union, so as to enhance its political, diplomatic, social, 
    economic, and military efforts to project stability eastward and 
    maximize its capabilities in crisis prevention and crisis 
    management.
        (3) The feasibility of having NATO conduct security operations 
    beyond the geographic boundaries of the alliance.
        (4) The manner in which NATO should restructure its forces, 
    training and equipment for the new security environment, including 
    with regard to multinational peacekeeping activities.
        (5) The desirability of expanding the alliance to include 
    traditionally neutral nations or the new democratic nations of 
    Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union that wish to 
    join NATO.
        (6) The proper size and composition of United States forces to 
    be deployed in Europe to assist in the implementation of NATO's new 
    mandate and possible reduction in United States military deployments 
    in Europe in the event of the alliance's failure to adopt a new 
    mandate.
        (7) The structure and organization of NATO headquarters, with 
    particular attention to the need to reinvigorate the NATO Military 
    Committee.
        (8) The extent to which NATO liaison teams should be assigned to 
    the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
    Europe so as to facilitate better coordination among these 
    organizations, especially in regard to crisis prevention and crisis 
    management.
        (9) The desirability of having additional NATO forces train in 
    North America in a manner supportive of NATO's proposed new 
    strategy.
        (10) The structure of NATO's military command, with particular 
    attention to the need to make NATO's Rapid Reaction Force a credible 
    deterrent to regional aggression.
        (11) The levels of United States, European, and Canadian defense 
    budgets and their ability to finance forces consistent with the 
    implementation of NATO's new mandate.

SEC. 1412. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN REPORT REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Biennial NATO Report.--Section 1002(d) of the Department of 
Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (Public Law 98-525; 22 U.S.C. 1928

the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report assessing what effect the increased use of dual-use 
and commercial technologies and items by the Department of Defense could 
have on the ability of the United States to control adequately the

        (1) an assessment of the national security implications of any 
    lowering of licensing controls on the export of dual-use items and

    and capabilities and planned United States defense programs and 
    capabilities;
        (2) a description of the steps the Secretary of Defense intends 
    to take to ensure that any decontrol of dual-use items and 
    technology does not place at risk the technology and defense 
    capability lead that the United States currently enjoys; and
        (3) a description of the steps the Department of Defense intends 
    to take to mitigate any possible increase in the proliferation 
    threat resulting from decontrol of dual-use items and technology.
    (c) Consultation.--The report required by subsection (a) shall be 
prepared in consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence.

SEC. 1423. EXTENSION OF LANDMINE EXPORT MORATORIUM.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Anti-personnel landmines, which are designed to maim and 
    kill people, have been used indiscriminately in dramatically 
    increasing numbers around the world. Hundreds of thousands of 
    noncombatant civilians, including children, have been the primary 
    victims. Unlike other military weapons, landmines often remain 
    implanted and undiscovered after conflict has ended, causing massive 
    suffering to civilian populations.
        (2) Tens of millions of landmines have been strewn in at least 
    62 countries, often making whole areas uninhabitable. The Department 
    of State estimates that there are more than 10,000,000 landmines in 
    Afghanistan, 9,000,000 in Angola, 4,000,000 in Cambodia, 3,000,000 
    in Iraqi Kurdistan, and 2,000,000 each in Somalia, Mozambique, and 
    the former Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands of landmines were used 
    in conflicts in Central America in the 1980s.
        (3) Advanced technologies are being used to manufacture 
    sophisticated mines which can be scattered remotely at a rate of 
    1,000 per hour. These mines, which are being produced by many 
    industrialized countries, were found in Iraqi arsenals after the 
    Persian Gulf War.
        (4) At least 300 types of anti-personnel landmines have been 
    manufactured by at least 44 countries, including the United States. 
    However, the United States is not a major exporter of landmines. 
    During the 10 years from 1983 through 1992, the United States 
    approved 10 licenses for the commercial export of anti-personnel 
    landmines with a total value of $980,000 and the sale under the 
    Foreign Military Sales program of 108,852 anti-personnel landmines.
        (5) The United States signed, but has not ratified, the 1980 
    Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain 
    Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious 
    or To Have Indiscriminate Effects. Protocol II of the Convention, 
    otherwise known as the Landmine Protocol, prohibits the 
    indiscriminate use of landmines.
        (6) When it signed the 1980 Convention, the United States 
    stated: ``We believe that the Convention represents a positive step 
    forward in efforts to minimize injury or damage to the civilian 
    population in time of armed conflict. Our signature of the 
    Convention reflects the general willingness of the United States to 
    adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning the conduct of 
    military operations, for the purpose of protecting noncombatants.''.
        (7) The United States also indicated that it had supported 
    procedures to enforce compliance, which were omitted from the 
    Convention's final draft. The United States stated: ``The United 
    States strongly supported proposals by other countries during the 
    Conference to include special procedures for dealing with compliance 
    matters, and reserves the right to propose at a later date 
    additional procedures and remedies, should this prove necessary, to 
    deal with such problems.''.
        (8) The lack of compliance procedures and other weaknesses have 
    significantly undermined the effectiveness of the Landmine Protocol. 
    Since it entered into force on December 2, 1983, the number of 
    civilians maimed and killed by anti-personnel landmines has 
    multiplied.
        (9) Since October 23, 1992, when a one-year moratorium on sales, 
    transfers, and exports by the United States of anti-personnel 
    landmines was enacted into law (in section 1365 of the National 
    Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 
    22 U.S.C. 2778 note)), the European Parliament has issued a 
    resolution calling for a five year moratorium on sales, transfers, 
    and exports of anti-personnel landmines and the Government of France 
    has announced that it has ceased all sales, transfers, and exports 
    of anti-personnel landmines.
        (10) On December 2, 1993, 10 years will have elapsed since the 
    1980 Convention entered into force, triggering the right of any 
    party to request a United Nations conference to review the 
    Convention. Amendments to the Landmine Protocol may be considered at 
    that time. A formal request has been made to the United Nations 
    Secretary General for a review conference. With necessary 
    preparations and consultations among governments, a review 
    conference is not expected to be convened before late 1994 or early 
    1995.
        (11) The United States should continue to set an example for 
    other countries in such negotiations by extending the moratorium on 
    sales, transfers, and exports of anti-personnel landmines for an 
    additional three years. A moratorium of that duration would extend 
    the prohibition on the sale, transfer, and export of anti-personnel 
    landmines a sufficient time to take into account the results of a 
    United Nations review conference.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--
        (1) It is the policy of the United States to seek verifiable 
    international agreements prohibiting the sale, transfer or export, 
    and further limiting the manufacture, possession and use, of anti-
    personnel landmines.
        (2) It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (A) the President should submit the 1980 Convention on 
        Certain Conventional Weapons to the Senate for ratification; and
            (B) the United States should--
                (i) participate in a United Nations conference to review 
            the Landmine Protocol; and
                (ii) actively seek to negotiate under United Nations 
            auspices a modification of the Landmine Protocol, or another 
            international agreement, to prohibit the sale, transfer, or 
            export of anti-personnel landmines and to further limit the 
            manufacture, possession, and use of anti-personnel 
            landmines.
    (c) Three-Year Extension of Landmine Moratorium.--Section 1365(c) of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 
102-484; 22 U.S.C. 2778 note) is amended by striking out ``For a period 
of one year beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act'' and 
inserting in lieu thereof ``During the four-year period beginning on 
October 23, 1992''.
    (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``anti-
personnel landmine'' means any of the following:
        (1) Any munition placed under, on, or near the ground or other 
    surface area, or delivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, or similar 
    means or dropped from an aircraft and which is designed to be 
    detonated or exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a 
    person.
        (2) Any device or material which is designed, constructed, or 
    adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a 
    person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or 
    performs an apparently safe act.
        (3) Any manually-emplaced munition or device designed to kill, 
    injure, or damage and which is actuated by remote control or 
    automatically after a lapse of time.

        (1) It is in the national security interest of the United States 
    to promote democracy throughout the world.
        (2) The armed forces of newly democratic nations often lack the 
    democratic traditions that are a hallmark of the Armed Forces of the 
    United States.

    democracy is essential for the development and preservation of 
    democratic forms of government.
        (4) The service of retired members of the Armed Forces of the 
    United States in the armed forces of newly democratic nations could 
    lead to a better understanding of military roles and missions in a

        (4) A summary of progress made by the United States, in 
    consultation with other nations, to develop doctrine for

    that had claimed more than 300,000 lives.
        (2) Since the mission of United States forces in support of the

    with respect to Somalia, including in particular the deployment of 
    United States Armed Forces in that country, whether under United 
    Nations or United States command.
        (2) Planning.--The United States shall facilitate the assumption 
    of the functions of United States forces by the United Nations.

        those forces are clearly articulated and provided in a detailed 
        report to the Congress by October 15, 1993.
            (B) Such report shall include the status of planning to 
        transfer the function contained in paragraph (2).

    requirements of paragraph (3) Congress believes the President should 
    by November 15, 1993, seek and receive congressional authorization

          Subtitle B--International Nonproliferation Activities

SEC. 1611. NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The United States has been seeking to contain the spread of 
    nuclear weapons technology and materials.
        (2) With the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet 
    Union, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is now a leading 
    military threat to the national security of the United States and 
    its allies.
        (3) The United Nations Security Council declared on January 31, 
    1992, that ``proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction 
    constitutes a threat to international peace and security'' and 
    committed to taking appropriate action to prevent proliferation from 
    occurring.
        (4) Aside from the five declared nuclear weapon states, a number 
    of other nations have or are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities.
        (5) The IAEA is a valuable international institution to counter 
    proliferation, but the effectiveness of its system to safeguard 
    nuclear materials may be adversely affected by financial 
    constraints.
        (6) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty codifies world 
    consensus against further nuclear proliferation and is scheduled for 
    review and extension in 1995.
        (7) The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 declared that the 
    United States is committed to continued strong support for the 
    Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to a strengthened and more 
    effective IAEA, and established that it is United States policy to 
    establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear 
    equipment, materials, and technology.
    (b) Comprehensive Nuclear Nonproliferation Policy.--In order to end 
nuclear proliferation and reduce current nuclear arsenals and supplies 
of weapons-usable nuclear materials, it should be the policy of the 
United States to pursue a comprehensive policy to end the further spread 
of nuclear weapons capability, roll back nuclear proliferation where it 
has occurred, and prevent the use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the 
world, with the following additional objectives:
        (1) Successful conclusion of all pending nuclear arms control 
    and disarmament agreements with all the republics of the former 
    Soviet Union and their secure implementation.
        (2) Full participation by all the republics of the former Soviet 
    Union in all multilateral nuclear nonproliferation efforts and 
    acceptance of IAEA safeguards on all their nuclear facilities.
        (3) Strengthening of United States and international support to 
    the IAEA so that the IAEA has the technical, financial, and 
    political resources to verify that countries are complying with 
    their nonproliferation commitments.
        (4) Strengthening of nuclear export controls in the United 
    States and other nuclear supplier nations, impose sanctions on 
    individuals, companies, and countries which contribute to nuclear 
    proliferation, and provide increased public information on nuclear 
    export licenses approved in the United States.
        (5) Reduction in incentives for countries to pursue the 
    acquisition of nuclear weapons by seeking to reduce regional 
    tensions and to strengthen regional security agreements, and 
    encourage the United Nations Security Council to increase its role 
    in enforcing international nuclear nonproliferation agreements.
        (6) Support for the indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty at the 1995 conference to review and extend 
    that treaty and seek to ensure that all countries sign the treaty or 
    participate in a comparable international regime for monitoring and 
    safeguarding nuclear facilities and materials.
        (7) Reaching agreement with the Russian Federation to end the 
    production of new types of nuclear warheads.
        (8) Pursuing, once the START I treaty and the START II treaty 
    are ratified by all parties, a multilateral agreement to 
    significantly reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United 
    States and the Russian Federation to below the levels of the START 
    II treaty, with lower levels for the United Kingdom, France, and the 
    People's Republic of China.
        (9) Reaching immediate agreement with the Russian Federation to 
    halt permanently the production of fissile material for weapons 
    purposes, and working to achieve worldwide agreements to--
            (A) end in the shortest possible time the production of 
        weapons-usable fissile material;
            (B) place existing stockpiles of such materials under 
        bilateral or international controls; and
            (C) require countries to place all of their nuclear 
        facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes under IAEA safeguards.
        (10) Strengthening IAEA safeguards to more effectively verify 
    that countries are complying with their nonproliferation commitments 
    and provide the IAEA with the political, technical, and financial 
    support necessary to implement the necessary safeguard reforms.
        (11) Conclusion of a multilateral comprehensive nuclear test ban 
    treaty.
    (c) Requirements for Implementation of Policy.--(1) Not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President 
shall submit to the Congress a report, in unclassified form, with a 
classified appendix if necessary, on the actions the United States has 
taken and the actions the United States plans to take during the 
succeeding 12-month period to implement each of the policy objectives 
set forth in this section.
    (2) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the President shall submit to the Congress a report in unclassified 
form, with a classified appendix if necessary, which--
        (A) addresses the implications of the adoption by the United 
    States of a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons;
        (B) addresses the implications of an agreement with the other 
    nuclear weapons states to adopt such a policy; and
        (C) addresses the implications of a verifiable bilateral 
    agreement with the Russian Federation under which both countries 
    withdraw from their arsenals and dismantle all tactical nuclear 
    weapons, and seek to extend to all nuclear weapons states this zero 
    option for tactical nuclear weapons.
    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term ``IAEA'' means the International Atomic Energy 
    Agency.
        (2) The term ``IAEA safeguards'' means the safeguards set forth 
    in an agreement between a country and the IAEA, as authorized by 
    Article III(A)(5) of the Statute of the International Atomic Energy 
    Agency.
        (3) The term ``non-nuclear weapon state'' means any country that 
    is not a nuclear weapon state.
        (4) The term ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'' means the

SEC. 1612. CONDITION ON ASSISTANCE TO RUSSIA FOR CONSTRUCTION OF 
PLUTONIUM STORAGE FACILITY.
    (a) Limitation.--Until a certification under subsection (b) is made, 
no funds may be obligated or expended by the United States for the 
purpose of assisting the Ministry of Atomic Energy of Russia to 
construct a storage facility for surplus plutonium from dismantled 
weapons.
    (b) Certification of Russia's Commitment to Halt Chemical Separation 
of Weapon-Grade Plutonium.--The prohibition in subsection (a) shall 
cease to apply upon a certification by the President to Congress that 
Russia--
        (1) is committed to halting the chemical separation of weapon-
    grade plutonium from spent nuclear fuel; and
        (2) is taking all practical steps to halt such separation at the 
    earliest possible date.
    (c) Sense of Congress on Plutonium Policy.--It is the sense of 
Congress that a key objective of the United States with respect to the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons should be to obtain a clear and 
unequivocal commitment from the Government of Russia that it will (1) 
cease all production and separation of weapon-grade plutonium, and (2) 
halt chemical separation of plutonium produced in civil nuclear power 
reactors.
    (d) Report.--Not later than June 1, 1994, the President shall submit 
to Congress a report on the status of efforts by the United States to 
secure the commitments and achieve the objective described in 
subsections (b) and (c). The President shall include in the report a 
discussion of the status of joint efforts by the United States and 
Russia to replace any remaining Russian plutonium production reactors 
with alternative power sources or to convert such reactors to operation 
with alternative fuels that would permit their operation without 
generating weapon-grade plutonium.
SEC. 1613. NORTH KOREA AND THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to 
    which 156 states are party, is the cornerstone of the international 
    nuclear nonproliferation regime.
        (2) Any nonnuclear weapon state that is a party to the Treaty on 
    the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is obligated to accept 
    International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards on all source or 
    special fissionable material that is within its territory, under its 
    jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.
        (3) The International Atomic Energy Agency is permitted to 
    conduct inspections in a nonnuclear weapon state that is a party to 
    the Treaty at any site, whether or not declared by that state, to 
    ensure that all source or special fissionable material in that state 
    is under safeguards.
        (4) North Korea acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
    of Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear weapons state in December 1985.
        (5) North Korea, after acceding to that Treaty, refused until 
    1992 to accept International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards as 
    required under the Treaty.
        (6) Inspections of North Korea's nuclear materials by the 
    International Atomic Energy Agency suggested discrepancies in North 
    Korea's declarations regarding special nuclear materials.
        (7) North Korea has not given a scientifically satisfactory 
    explanation for those discrepancies.
        (8) North Korea refused to provide International Atomic Energy 
    Agency inspectors with full access to two sites for the purposes of 
    verifying its compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
    Nuclear Weapons.
        (9) When called upon by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
    to provide such full access as required by the Treaty, North Korea 
    announced its intention to withdraw from the Treaty, effective after 
    the required three months notice.
        (10) After intensive negotiations with the United States, North 
    Korea agreed to suspend its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on 
    the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and begin consultations 
    with the International Atomic Energy Agency on providing access to 
    its suspect sites.
        (11) In an attempt to persuade North Korea to abandon its 
    nuclear weapons program, the United States has offered to discuss 
    with North Korea specific incentives that could be provided for 
    North Korea once (A) outstanding inspection issues between North 
    Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency are resolved, and 
    (B) progress is made in bilateral talks between North Korea and 
    South Korea.
    (b) Congressional Statements.--The Congress--
        (1) notes that the continued refusal of North Korea nearly eight 
    years after ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
    Nuclear Weapons to fully accept International Atomic Energy Agency 
    safeguards raises serious questions regarding a possible North 
    Korean nuclear weapons program;
        (2) notes that possession by North Korea of nuclear weapons (A) 
    would threaten peace and stability in Asia, (B) would jeopardize the 
    existing nuclear non-proliferation regime, and (C) would undermine 
    the goal of the United States to extend the Treaty on the Non-
    Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the 1995 review conference;
        (3) urges continued pressure from the President, United States 
    allies, and the United Nations Security Council on North Korea to 
    adhere to the Treaty and provide full access to the International 
    Atomic Energy Agency in the shortest time possible;
        (4) urges the President, United States allies, and the United 
    Nations Security Council to press for continued talks between North 
    Korea and South Korea on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula;
        (5) urges that no trade, financial, or other economic benefits 
    be provided to North Korea by the United States or United States 
    allies until North Korea has (A) provided full access to the 
    International Atomic Energy Agency, (B) satisfactorily explained any 
    discrepancies in its declarations of bomb-grade material, and (C) 
    fully demonstrated that it does not have or seek a nuclear weapons 
    capability; and
        (6) calls on the President and the international community to 
    take steps to strengthen the international nuclear nonproliferation 
    regime.
SEC. 1614. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE PROLIFERATION OF SPACE 
LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The United States has joined with other nations in the 
    Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which restricts the 
    transfer of missiles or equipment or technology that could 
    contribute to the design, development, or production of missiles 
    capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.
        (2) Missile technology is indistinguishable from, and 
    interchangeable with, space launch vehicle technology.
        (3) Transfers of missile technology or space launch vehicle 
    technology cannot be safeguarded in a manner that would provide 
    timely warning of diversion for military purposes.
        (4) It has been United States policy since agreeing to the 
    guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime to treat the 
    sale or transfer of space launch vehicle technology as restrictively 
    as the sale or transfer of missile technology.
        (5) Previous congressional action on missile proliferation, 
    notably title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
    Fiscal Year 1991 (Public Law 101-510; 104 Stat. 1738), has 
    explicitly supported the policy described in paragraph (4) through 
    such actions as the statutory definition of the term ``missile'' to 
    mean ``a category I system as defined in the MTCR Annex, and any 
    other unmanned delivery system of similar capability, as well as the 
    specially designed production facilities for these systems''.
        (6) There is strong evidence that emerging national space launch 
    programs in the Third World are not economically viable.
        (7) The United States has been successful in dissuading other 
    countries from pursuing space launch vehicle programs in part by 
    offering to cooperate with those countries in other areas of space 
    science and technology.
        (8) The United States has successfully dissuaded other MTCR 
    adherents, and countries who have agreed to abide by MTCR 
    guidelines, from providing assistance to emerging national space 
    launch programs in the Third World.
    (b) Strict Interpretation of MTCR.--The Congress supports the strict 
interpretation by the United States of the Missile Technology Control 
Regime concerning--
        (1) the inability to distinguish space launch vehicle technology 
    from missile technology under the regime; and
        (2) the inability to safeguard space launch vehicle technology 
    in a manner that would provide timely warning of the diversion of 
    such technology to military purposes.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States Government and the governments of other nations adhering to the 
Missile Technology Control Regime should be recognized by the 
international community for--
        (1) the success of those governments in restricting the export 
    of space launch vehicle technology and of missile technology; and
        (2) the significant contribution made by the imposition of such 
    restrictions to reducing the proliferation of missile technology 
    capable of being used to deliver weapons of mass destruction.
    (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``Missile 
Technology Control Regime'' or ``MTCR'' means the policy statement, 
between the United States, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of 
Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan, announced on April 16, 1987, 
to restrict sensitive missile-relevant transfers based on the MTCR 
Annex, and any amendments thereto.

other instrumentality of the Department of Defense to participate in 
programs conducted by a utility for the management of water demand or 
for water conservation.
    ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may authorize a military installation 
to accept a financial incentive (including an agreement to reduce the 
amount of a future water bill), goods, or services generally available 
from a utility, for the purpose of adopting technologies and practices 
that--
        ``(A) relate to the management of water demand or to water 
    conservation; and
        ``(B) as determined by the Secretary, are cost effective for the 
    Federal Government.
    ``(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may 
authorize the Secretary of a military department having jurisdiction 
over a military installation to enter into an agreement with a utility 
to design and implement a cost-effective program that provides 
incentives for the management of water demand and for water conservation 
and that addresses the requirements and circumstances of the 
installation. Activities under the program may include the provision of 
water management services, the alteration of a facility, and the 
installation and maintenance by the utility of a water-saving device or 
technology.
    ``(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility 
to pay in advance the financing costs for the design or implementation 
of a program referred to in that paragraph and for such advance payment 
to be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance payment may 
be recovered by the utility under terms that are not less favorable than 
the terms applicable to the most favored customer of the utility.
    ``(B) Subject to the availability of appropriations, a repayment of 
an advance payment under subparagraph (A) shall be made from funds 
available to a military department for the purchase of utility services.
    ``(C) An agreement under paragraph (3) shall provide that title to a 
water-saving device or technology installed at a military installation 
pursuant to the agreement shall vest in the United States. Such title 
may vest at such time during the term of the agreement, or upon 
expiration of the agreement, as determined to be in the best interests 
of the United States.
    ``(b) Use of Water Cost Savings.--Water cost savings realized under 
this section shall be used as provided in section 2865(b)(2) of this 
title.
    ``(c) Water Conservation Construction Projects.--(1) The Secretary 
of Defense may carry out a military construction project for water 
conservation, not previously authorized, using funds appropriated or 
otherwise made available to the Secretary for water conservation.
    ``(2) When a decision is made to carry out a project under paragraph 
(1), the Secretary of Defense shall notify the Committees on Armed 
Services and Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives 
of that decision. Such project may be carried out only after the end of 
the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by 
such committees.''.

includes--
        ``(A) the repair by replacement of equipment or systems, such as 
    lighting, heating, or cooling equipment or systems or industrial 
    processes, with technology that--
            ``(i) will achieve the most cost-effective energy savings 
        over the life-cycle of the equipment or system being repaired; 
        and
            ``(ii) will meet the same end needs as the equipment or 
        system being repaired; and
        ``(B) improvements in an operation or maintenance process, such 
    as improved training or improved controls, that result in reduced 
    costs through energy savings''.
    (b) Use of Savings and Use of Proceeds From Electricity Sales.--
Subsection (b) of such section is amended--
        (1) in paragraph (1)--
            (A) by striking out ``The Secretary shall provide that two-
        thirds'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``Two-thirds''; and

    installations of the Department of Defense as may be designated (in

            TITLE XXIX--DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT
              Subtitle A--Base Closure Community Assistance

SEC. 2901. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The closure and realignment of military installations within 
    the United States is a necessary consequence of the end of the Cold 
    War and of changed United States national security requirements.
        (2) A military installation is a significant source of 
    employment for many communities, and the closure or realignment of 
    an installation may cause economic hardship for such communities.
        (3) It is in the interest of the United States that the Federal 
    Government facilitate the economic recovery of communities that 
    experience adverse economic circumstances as a result of the closure 
    or realignment of a military installation.
        (4) It is in the interest of the United States that the Federal 
    Government assist communities that experience adverse economic 
    circumstances as a result of the closure of military installations 
    by working with such communities to identify and implement means of 
    reutilizing or redeveloping such installations in a beneficial 
    manner or of otherwise revitalizing such communities and the 
    economies of such communities.
        (5) The Federal Government may best identify and implement such 
    means by requiring that the head of each department or agency of the 
    Federal Government having jurisdiction over a matter arising out of 
    the closure of a military installation under a base closure law, or 
    the reutilization and redevelopment of such an installation, 
    designate for each installation to be closed an individual in such 
    department or agency who shall provide information and assistance to 
    the transition coordinator for the installation designated under 
    section 2915 on the assistance, programs, or other activities of 
    such department or agency with respect to the closure or 
    reutilization and redevelopment of the installation.
        (6) The Federal Government may also provide such assistance by 
    accelerating environmental restoration at military installations to 
    be closed, and by closing such installations, in a manner that best 
    ensures the beneficial reutilization and redevelopment of such 
    installations by such communities.
        (7) The Federal Government may best contribute to such 
    reutilization and redevelopment by making available real and 
    personal property at military installations to be closed to 
    communities affected by such closures on a timely basis, and, if 
    appropriate, at less than fair market value.
