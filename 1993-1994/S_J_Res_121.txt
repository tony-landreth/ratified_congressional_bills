                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

                            Joint Resolution


 
   To designate October 6, 1993 and 1994, as ``German-American Day''.

Whereas German immigrants first arrived in America at Jamestown, 
  Virginia, in October 1608, and the 400th anniversary of the arrival of 
  these first Germans will be celebrated in 2008;
Whereas the first German settlement in America was founded on October 6, 
  1683 at Germantown, Pennsylvania, and October 6, 1983, was designated 
  as the German-American Tricentennial Celebration by Congressional 
  Resolution and Presidential Proclamation;
Whereas the number of American citizens of German ancestry has grown to 
  over 50 million since the first German immigrants arrived in this 
  country;
Whereas German-Americans are proud of the existing friendship and 
  cooperation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United 
  States;
Whereas the German-American Friendship Garden in Washington, D.C., is 
  evidence of this cooperation;
Whereas German-Americans support expansion of the existing friendship 
  between Germany and the United States, and will continue to contribute 
  to the culture of the United States, support its government and 
  democratic principles, and help ensure the freedom of all people;
Whereas German unification stands as a symbol of greater international 
  cooperation and has reemphasized the prominent position of Germany in 
  the European community and between the East and the West;
Whereas Congress unanimously passed joint resolutions designating 
  October 6th of 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992, each as 
  ``German-American Day'': Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That October 6, 1993 and 1994, 
are each designated as ``German-American Day'',
and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation 
calling on the people of the United States to observe the days with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.
