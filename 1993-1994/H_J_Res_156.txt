                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,

                            Joint Resolution


 
   Concerning the dedication of the United States Holocaust Memorial 
                                 Museum.

Whereas, in 1980, the Congress of the United States established the 
  United States Holocaust Memorial Council (Public Law 96-388, dated 
  October 7, 1980) by unanimous vote and mandated it with the creation 
  of a permanent living memorial museum to the victims of the Holocaust;
Whereas, through the great generosity and unstinting efforts of 
  thousands of individuals from all walks of life, the United States 
  Holocaust Memorial Museum has now been built on Federal land with 
  private contributions and will be officially dedicated on April 22, 
  1993;
Whereas, this institution will underscore the ideals of human rights and 
  individual liberty this Nation was founded upon, as expressed by 
  President George Washington in 1790, when he declared that the United 
  States had created ``a government which to bigotry gives no sanction, 
  to persecution no assistance'';
Whereas, four administrations and every Congress since 1980, and 
  especially Members of Congress and individuals who have served on the 
  Council and officials of the United States Departments of State, the 
  Interior, and Education, have joined with the American public in 
  bringing this institution to life; and
Whereas, this museum signifies national dedication to remembering the 
  Holocaust, and will serve as the Nation's leading educational facility 
  to teach current and future generations of Americans about this tragic 
  period of human history and its implications for our lives and the 
  choices we make as individuals and societies against crimes based on 
  hate and prejudice regarding race, religion, and sexual preference: 
  Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the One Hundred Third 
Congress officially commemorates the opening and recognizes the historic 
importance of this unique institution as it takes its place among the 
other great memorials and museums in our Nation's Capital that honor the 
democratic precepts this Nation is based upon; and be it further
    Resolved, That Congress encourages all citizens of the United 
States, and all who come to Washington, District of Columbia, to visit 
the Museum and avail themselves of the opportunities presented within 
its walls to learn about the past and to contemplate the moral 
responsibilities of citizenship; and be it further
    Resolved, That, in remembrance of those who perished in the 
Holocaust; in tribute to the survivors who came to the United States to 
build a new life, and who, with their families, have contributed so much 
to the fabric of our diverse society; in recognition of heroic American 
soldiers who liberated prisoners of Nazi camps; in recognition of the 
anonymous bravery of rescuers from many lands who had the courage to 
care and placed their own lives in peril to help others in need; and in 
hope that Americans will learn from this museum the need to remain 
vigilant against bigotry and oppression; we welcome the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum to the center of our American heritage and 
state now, in recognition of the Museum's motto, that for the dead and 
the living and those yet to be born, we do bear witness.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
