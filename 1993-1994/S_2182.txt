    crises and to provide assistance after natural disasters.
        (2) Extensive testimony received by the Committee on Armed 
    Services of the Senate in 1994 and prior years from military and 
    civilian officials of the Department of Defense provided compelling 
    support for a military requirement for 12 Amphibious Ready Groups.
        (3) Twelve Amphibious Ready Groups is the correct number of 
    amphibious ready groups necessary to sustain forward deployment and 
    contingency requirements of the Navy.
        (4) A report of the Department of the Navy (prepared pursuant 
    to requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
    Fiscal Year 1993) clearly stipulates that a seventh LHD amphibious 
    assault vessel is required in order for the Navy to achieve a force 
    of 12 Amphibious Ready Groups.
        (5) A significant shortfall in amphibious shipping and 
    amphibious lift exists, both in the fiscal year 1995 budget request 
    and in outyear force structure projections.
        (6) The Department of the Navy has identified funds in outyear 
    budget projections for the purchase of the amphibious assault 
    vessel designated as LHD-7.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Navy--
        (1) should plan for, and budget to provide for, the attainment 
    of a twelfth Amphibious Ready Group as soon as possible; and
        (2) should extend the existing contract option on the LHD-7 
    Amphibious Assault Ship to facilitate achieving 12 Amphibious Ready 
    Groups.
    (c) LHD-7 Contract Option Extension.--(1) The Secretary of the Navy 
is authorized to extend the existing contract option for the LHD-7 
Amphibious Assault ship if the Secretary determines that the extension 
would be in the best interest of the United States.
    (2) The Secretary of the Navy shall immediately begin negotiations 
to extend the existing contract option for the LHD-7 Amphibious Assault 
Ship Program.
    (3) On and after the date that is 30 days after the date on which 
the Secretary notifies Congress of an intention to do so, the Secretary 
may use for such contract option extension funds that are authorized to 
be appropriated for other Navy programs. The notification shall include 
a description of the intended use of the funds.

Congress, after December 31, 1994, but before March 31, 1995, a report 
stating the Secretary's intentions regarding exercise of the existing 
contract option for the LHD-7 Amphibious Assault Ship. The report shall 
include an explanation of the Secretary's actions regarding attainment 
of a twelfth Amphibious Ready Group and the costs and benefits of

    maintenance and repair of weapon systems and equipment, the depot-
    level maintenance and repair activities of the Department of 
    Defense play an essential role in maintaining the readiness of the 
    Armed Forces.

    mobilization, and deployment requirements of the military 
    departments.
        (3) It is appropriate for the management of employees of the 
    depot-level maintenance and repair activities of the Department of 
    Defense to be based on the amount of workload necessary to be 
    performed by such activities to maintain the readiness of the 
    weapon systems and equipment of the military departments and on the 
    funds made available for the performance of such workload.

SEC. 347. REPORT ON CONVERSION OF CERTAIN POSITIONS TO PERFORMANCE BY 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EMPLOYEES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) In order to ensure an optimum level of availability of 
    members of the Armed Forces for assignment to combat units, it is 
    the policy of the Department of Defense to assign employees of the 
    Department of Defense to replace military personnel in Department 
    of Defense positions to which assignment of military personnel can 
    no longer be justified under current circumstances.
        (2) Assignment of employees of the Department of Defense to 
    such positions can provide valuable continuity for the performance 
    of many missions of the Department while enhancing the readiness 
    and military capability of the Armed Forces.
        (3) During the Persian Gulf War, employees of the Department of 
    Defense, employees of other Federal agencies, and employees of 
    civilian contractors, by their distinguished service in the theater 
    of operations, demonstrated the valuable contributions that 
    civilian personnel can make to the performance of Department of 
    Defense functions.
        (4) The performance of Department of Defense functions by 
    employees of the Department is often less costly than the 
    performance of those functions by military personnel.
        (5) The percentage of certain support positions that are filled 
    by employees of the Department of Defense varies significantly 
    among the military departments.
        (6) The Secretary of Defense is reviewing the extent to which 
    employees of the Department of Defense should replace military 
    personnel in Department of Defense positions.
    (b) Requirement for Report.--Not later than April 30, 1995, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services 
of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the efforts of 
the Secretary--
        (1) to identify positions in the Department of Defense to which 
    continued assignment of military personnel is no longer justified 
    under current circumstances; and
        (2) to assign employees of the Department of Defense to replace 
    military personnel in those positions.
    (c) Content of Report.--The report required by subsection (b) shall 
contain the following:
        (1) The number of positions identified by the Secretary, 
    including the positions in which employees of the Department of 
    Defense have replaced military personnel and the positions to which 
    employees of the Department of Defense are planned to be assigned 
    to replace military personnel.
        (2) The cost of carrying out the planned changes in 
    assignments.
        (3) A discussion of the effects of such changes on workforce 
    restructuring plans of the Department.
        (4) A discussion of the efforts of the Secretary to encourage 
    within the Department of Defense the assignment of employees of the 
    Department to replace military personnel.
        (5) An explanation of the justifications for maintaining 
    variances in excess of 20 percent among the military departments in

continuous employment by that employer. Subject to subsection (f), the 
Secretary shall prescribe the amount of the incentive.

retraining incentive to the non-Federal employer for an employee who 
does not remain employed by the non-Federal employer for at least 12 
months.

the training of any one person under the pilot program exceed the

    (d) Relocation Incentive.--The Secretary may pay a relocation 
incentive to an eligible employee if it is necessary for the employee 
to relocate in order to commence employment with a non-Federal employer 
under the pilot program. Subject to subsection (f), the amount of the 
incentive shall be equal to the total amount authorized to be paid for 
travel, transportation, and subsistence expenses under subchapter II of 
chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, including the reimbursements 
authorized under section 5724b of such title, to a Federal employee 
being transferred between the same locations as the person paid the

    ``(a) Authority of Secretary.--If the Secretary of Defense makes a 
determination that appropriate educational programs are not available 
through a local educational agency for dependents of members of the 
armed forces and dependents of civilian employees of the Federal 
Government residing on a military installation in the United States 
(including territories, commonwealths, and possessions of the United 
States), the Secretary may enter into arrangements to provide for the 
elementary or secondary education of the dependents of such members of 
the armed forces and, to the extent authorized in subsection (c), the 
dependents of such civilian employees. The Secretary may, at the 
discretion of the Secretary, permit dependents of members of the armed 
forces and, to the extent provided in subsection (c), dependents of 
civilian employees of the Federal Government residing in a territory, 
commonwealth, or possession of the United States but not on a military 
installation, to enroll in an educational program provided by the 
Secretary pursuant to this subsection.
    ``(b) Factors for Secretary To Consider.--(1) Factors to be 
considered by the Secretary of Defense in making a determination under 
subsection (a) shall include the following:
        ``(A) The extent to which such dependents are eligible for free 
    public education in the local area adjacent to the military 
    installation.
        ``(B) The extent to which the local educational agency is able 
    to provide an appropriate educational program for such dependents.
    ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), an appropriate educational 
program is a program that, as determined by the Secretary, is 
comparable to a program of free public education provided for children 
by the following local educational agencies:
        ``(A) In the case of a military installation located in a State 
    (other than an installation referred to in subparagraph (B)), local 
    educational agencies in the State that are similar to the local 
    educational agency referred to in paragraph (1)(B).
        ``(B) In the case of a military installation with boundaries 
    contiguous to two or more States, local educational agencies in the 
    contiguous States that are similar to the local educational agency 
    referred to in paragraph (1)(B).

    territory, commonwealth, or possession, the District of Columbia 
    public schools, except that an educational program determined 
    comparable under this subparagraph may be considered appropriate 
    for the purposes of paragraph (1)(B) only if the program is 
    conducted in the English language.
    ``(c) Eligibility of Dependents of Federal Employees.--(1) A 
dependent of a Federal employee residing in permanent living quarters 
on a military installation at any time during the school year may 
enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary of Defense

not residing on a military installation may be enrolled in the program 
for not more than five consecutive school years.
    ``(B) A dependent referred to in subparagraph (A) may be enrolled 
in the program for more than five consecutive school years if the 
Secretary determines that, in the interest of the dependent's 
educational well-being, there is good cause to extend the enrollment 
for more than the five-year period described in such subparagraph. Any 
such extension may be made for only one school year at a time.
    ``(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an individual who is a 
dependent of a Federal employee in the excepted service (as defined in 
section 2103 of title 5) and who is enrolled in an educational program 
provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) in Puerto Rico, 
Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the

a program under this subsection for the remainder of a school year 
notwithstanding a change during such school year in the status of the 
Federal employee that, except for this paragraph, would otherwise 
terminate the eligibility of the dependent to be enrolled in the 
program. The preceding sentence does not limit the authority of the 
Secretary to remove the dependent from enrollment in the program at any 
time for good cause determined by the Secretary.
    ``(d) School Boards.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide 
for the establishment of a school board for Department of Defense

and educational policies, procedures, and programs for the school, 
except that the Secretary may issue any directive that the Secretary 
considers necessary for the effective operation of the school or the 
entire school system.
    ``(B) A directive referred to in subparagraph (A) shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, be issued only after the Secretary consults 
with the appropriate school boards elected under this subsection. The 
Secretary shall establish a process by which a school board or school 
administrative officials may formally appeal the directive to the 
Secretary of Defense.
    ``(5) Meetings conducted by the school board shall be open to the 
public, except as provided in paragraph (6).

Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), but may close meetings 
in accordance with such Act.

enter into such arrangements as may be necessary to provide educational 
programs at the school.

other law relating to the number, classification, or compensation of 
employees--
        ``(A) establish positions for civilian employees in schools 
    established under this section;
        ``(B) appoint individuals to such positions; and
        ``(C) fix the compensation of such individuals for service in 
    such positions.

compensation of employees appointed for a school pursuant to paragraph 
(2), the Secretary shall consider--
        ``(i) the compensation of comparable employees of the local 
    educational agency in the capital of the State where the military 
    installation is located;
        ``(ii) the compensation of comparable employees in the local 
    educational agency that provides public education to students who 
    reside adjacent to the military installation; and

    more than three other local educational agencies in the State in 
    which the military installation is located.
    ``(B) In fixing the compensation of employees in schools 
established in the territories, commonwealths, and possessions pursuant 
to the authority of this section, the Secretary shall determine the 
level of compensation required to attract qualified employees. For 
employees in such schools, the Secretary, without regard to the 
provisions of title 5, may provide for the tenure, leave, hours of 
work, and other incidents of employment to be similar to that provided 
for comparable positions in the public schools of the District of 
Columbia. For purposes of the first sentence, a school established 
before the effective date of this section pursuant to authority similar 
to the authority in this section shall be considered to have been 
established pursuant to the authority of this section.

Children.--(1) The Secretary shall provide the following substantive 
rights, protections, and procedural safeguards (including due process 
procedures) in the educational programs provided for under this 
section:

SEC. 521. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE TRAINING AND MODERNIZATION 
              OF THE RESERVE COMPONENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The force structure specified in the report resulting from 
    the Bottom Up Review conducted by the Department of Defense during 
    1993 assumes increased reliance on the reserve components of the 
    Armed Forces.
        (2) The mobilization of the reserve components for the Persian 
    Gulf War was handicapped by shortfalls in training, readiness, and 
    equipment.
        (3) The mobilization of the Army reserve components for the 
    Persian Gulf War was handicapped by lack of a standard readiness 
    evaluation system, which resulted in a lengthy reevaluation of 
    training and equipment readiness of Army National Guard and Army 
    Reserve units before they could be deployed.
        (4) Funding and scheduling constraints continue to limit the 
    opportunity for combat units of the Army National Guard to carry 
    out adequate maneuver training.
        (5) Funding constraints continue to handicap the readiness and 
    modernization of the reserve components and their interoperability 
    with the active forces.
    (b) Standard Evaluation System.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should establish--
        (1) a standard readiness evaluation system that is uniform for 
    all forces within each military service; and
        (2) a standard readiness rating system that is uniform for the 
    military departments.
    (c) Military Department Budgets.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of Defense should assess the budget submission of each 
military department each year to determine (taking into consideration 
the advice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) the extent to 
which National Guard and reserve units would, under that budget 
submission, be trained and modernized to the standards needed for them 
to carry out the full range of missions required of them under current 
Department of Defense plans. Based upon such assessment each year, the 
Secretary should adjust the budget submissions of the military 
departments as necessary in order to meet the priorities established by 
the Secretary of Defense for the total force.

fiscal year for paying such allowance.

        exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United 
        States for such base period, over
            ``(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal 
        year under subsection (c).
    ``(e) Limitation to One Allowance.--If primary dependents of a 
member reside separately in different high cost areas--
        ``(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance 
    under this section; and
        ``(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall 
    be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such 
    high cost areas.

be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel 
of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.

of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active

    means--
            ``(A) the member's spouse; or
            ``(B) in the case of an unmarried member, a dependent 
        described in paragraph (2) or (4) of section 401(a) of this

    (a) In General.--The fiscal year 1995 increase in military retired 
pay shall (notwithstanding subparagraph (B) of section 1401a(b)(2) of 
title 10, United States Code) first be payable as part of such retired 
pay for the month of March 1995.

        (1) The term ``fiscal year 1995 increase in military retired 
    pay'' means the increase in retired pay that, pursuant to paragraph 
    (1) of section 1401a(b) of title 10, United States Code, becomes

SEC. 632. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EQUAL TREATMENT OF EFFECTIVE DATES FOR 
              FUTURE COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR MILITARY AND 
              CIVILIAN RETIREES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Congress, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 
    changed the effective dates for future cost-of-living adjustments 
    for military retired pay and for Federal civilian retirement 
    annuities, which (before that Act) were provided by law to be made 
    effective on December 1 each year.
        (2) The timing, and the percentage of increase, of military and 
    Federal civilian retirees' cost-of-living adjustments have been 
    linked for decades.
        (3) The effect of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget 
    Reconciliation Act of 1993 was to abandon the longstanding 
    congressional practice of treating military and Federal civilian 
    retirees identically in matters related to cost-of-living 
    adjustments.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), 
it is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) as a matter of simple equity and fairness, it is imperative 
    that cost-of-living adjustments in retirement benefits for military 
    and Federal civilian retirees be returned to an identical schedule 
    as soon as possible, but not later than January 1, 1999;
        (2) if after October 1, 1998, there is, by law, a difference 
    between the date on which a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal 
    civilian retirees takes effect and the date on which a cost-of-
    living adjustment for military retirees takes effect, then the 
    difference in those effective dates should be eliminated by 
    requiring that cost-of-living adjustments for both classes of 
    retirees become effective on the earlier of the two dates; and
        (3) if after October 1, 1998, there is, by law, a difference 
    between the first month for which a cost-of-living adjustment for 
    civilian retirees is payable and the first month for which a cost-
    of-living adjustment for military retirees is payable, then the 
    difference in the months for which those adjustments are first 
    payable should be eliminated by requiring that the cost-of-living 
    adjustments for both classes of retirees first become payable for 
    the earlier of the two months.

SEC. 633. CLARIFICATION OF CALCULATION OF RETIRED PAY FOR OFFICERS WHO 
              RETIRE IN A GRADE LOWER THAN THE GRADE HELD AT

        (2) in the second sentence, by inserting ``, except that such 
    computation may not be based on a rate of basic pay for a grade 
    higher than the grade in which the member is retired'' before the 
    period at the end; and
        (3) by striking out the third sentence.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to the computation of the retired pay of a member of

              PREVENT PAY INVERSIONS IN RETIRED PAY OF CERTAIN MILITARY 
              RETIREES.

    (a) Authority.--The Secretary concerned may, for purposes of the 
computation under section 1401a(f) of title 10, United States Code, of 
the retired pay of military retirees described in subsection (b), waive 
any administrative time-in-grade regulation (as described in subsection 
(d)) that would otherwise apply to such computation. Any such waiver 
may be made retroactive, in the case of any such retiree, to the date 
on which that retiree initially became entitled to retired pay.
    (b) Covered Retirees.--This section applies to any military 
retiree--
        (1) who initially became entitled to retired pay on or after 
    January 1, 1971, and before the date of the enactment of this Act;
        (2) whose retired pay, by reason of the provisions of section 
    1401a(f) of title 10, United States Code (the so-called ``Tower 
    amendment''), was initially computed as an amount greater than 
    would have been the case but for that section; and
        (3) who, as of the earlier computation date applicable to that 
    retiree--
            (A) in the case of an individual retired in an enlisted 
        grade, had served in the grade in which the retiree retired for 
        a period that was less than the period prescribed by the 
        applicable administrative time-in-grade requirement described 
        in subsection (d); and
            (B) in the case of an individual retired in an officer 
        grade--
                (i) was subject to an administrative time-in-grade 
            requirement described in subsection (d) that established a 
            time-in-grade requirement that was longer than the 
            statutory time-in-grade requirement applicable to that 
            member; and
                (ii) had served in the grade in which the retiree 
            retired for a period that was less than the period 
            prescribed by such administrative time-in-grade requirement 
            but not less than the statutory time-in-grade requirement 
            applicable to that member.
    (c) Earlier Computation Date.--For purposes of subsection (b)(3), 
the earlier computation date applicable to a military retiree is the 
date that (under such section 1401a(f) as in effect on the date of the 
member's retirement) was the ``earlier date'' that was used as the 
basis for the computation of the retiree's retired pay.
    (d) Regulations Subject to Waiver.--A regulation that may be waived 
under subsection (a) is any regulation (not required by law) that 
establishes a minimum period of time that a member of the Armed Forces 
must have served in a grade on active duty in order to be eligible to 
retire in that grade.
    (e) Scope of Waiver Authority.--The Secretary concerned may 
exercise the authority provided in subsection (a) in the case of an 
individual military retiree or for any group of military retirees.
    (f) Military Retiree Defined.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``military retiree'' means a member or former member of the Armed 
Forces who is entitled to retired pay.
    (g) Secretary Concerned.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``Secretary concerned'' has the meaning given such term in section 101 
of title 10, United States Code.

    in such subsection;
        (2) determine the justifications for the requirement for offset 
    of disability compensation provided in each such provision of law;
        (3) assess the financial effects of the offset requirements on 
    affected veterans, and the fiscal effects of the offset 
    requirements on the Federal Government, taking into consideration--
            (A) an estimate (by the Comptroller General) of the number 
        of members of the Armed Forces who will separate from the Armed 
        Forces during the period beginning on the date of the enactment 
        of this Act and ending on September 30, 1999;
            (B) an estimate (by the Comptroller General) of--
                (i) the number of such members who will receive 
            separation benefits under the provisions of law referred to 
            in subsection (a); and
                (ii) the average amount of the benefits to be paid such 
            members;
            (C) an estimate (by the Comptroller General) of--
                (i) the number of such members who will be entitled to 
            disability compensation payable by the Secretary of 
            Veterans Affairs; and

            which such members will be entitled; and
            (D) an assessment (by the Comptroller General) of the 
        extent, if any, to which the offset affects the capacity of 
        such members to meet their financial obligations, including 
        financial obligations incurred in connection with service in 
        the Armed Forces or with separation from that service, and 
        increased net costs for housing and medical care;
        (4) determine the extent, if any, to which the offset of 
    disability compensation required under the provisions of law 
    referred to in subsection (a) reduces the effectiveness of such 
    provisions of law for achieving the purposes of those provisions of 
    law; and
        (5) determine the cost to the Federal Government that would 
    result from repeal of the offset requirements in such provisions of 
    law.
    (c) Results of Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the 
Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of

results of the study required under subsection (a). The report shall 
include recommendations of the Comptroller General for improvement of 
the separation benefits under the provisions of law referred to in

    disability rating criteria and interim efforts to adjudicate cases 
    before the revision of the criteria; and

        (1) The Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of the Senate, in 
    its final report, dated January 13, 1993, concluded--
            (A) that ``many American POWs had been held in China during 
        the Korean conflict and that foreign POW camps in both China 
        and North Korea were run by Chinese officials''; and
            (B) that ``given the fact that only 26 Army and 15 Air 
        Force personnel returned from China following the war, the 
        committee can now firmly conclude that the People's Republic of 
        China surely has information on the fate of other unaccounted 
        for American POWs from the Korean conflict.''.
        (2) The Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs recommended in that 
    report that ``the Department of State and Defense form a POW/MIA 
    task force on China similar to Task Force Russia.''.
        (3) Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of

    prisoners of war of the Korean conflict.

        (1) A complete listing by name of all such personnel about whom 
    it is possible that officials of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 
    can produce additional information or remains that could lead to 
    the maximum possible accounting for those personnel, as determined 
    on the basis of all information available to the United States 
    Government.
        (2) A complete listing by name of all such personnel about whom 
    it is possible that officials of the Lao People's Democratic

    lead to the maximum possible accounting for those personnel, as 
    determined on the basis of all information available to the United 
    States Government.

SEC. 1035. REPORT ON POW/MIA MATTERS CONCERNING NORTH KOREA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs of the Senate 
    concluded in its final report, dated January 13, 1993, that ``it is 
    likely that a large number of possible MIA remains can be 
    repatriated and several records and documents on unaccounted for 
    POW's and MIA's can be provided from North Korea once a joint 
    working level commission is set up under the leadership of the 
    United States.''.
        (2) The Select Committee recommended in such report that ``the 
    Departments of State and Defense take immediate steps to form this 
    commission through the United Nations Command at Panmunjom, Korea'' 
    and that the ``commission should have a strictly humanitarian 
    mission and should not be tied to political developments on the 
    Korean peninsula.''.
        (3) In August 1993, the United States and North Korea entered 
    into an agreement concerning the repatriation of remains of United 
    States personnel.
        (4) The establishment of a joint working level commission with 
    North Korea could enhance the prospects for results under the 
    August 1993 agreement.
    (b) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall, at the end of January 
and September of 1995, submit a report to Congress on the status of 
efforts to obtain information from North Korea concerning United States 
personnel involved in the Korean conflict who remain not accounted for 
and to obtain from North Korea any remains of such personnel.
    (c) Commission.--The President shall give serious consideration to 
establishing a joint working level commission with North Korea, 
consistent with the recommendations of the Select Committee on POW/MIA 
Affairs of the Senate set forth in the final report of the committee, 
dated January 13, 1993, to resolve the remaining issues relating to 
United States personnel who became prisoners of war or missing in 
action during the Korean conflict.

SEC. 1052. USS INDIANAPOLIS (CA-35): GALLANTRY, SACRIFICE AND A 
              DECISIVE MISSION TO END WW II.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The USS INDIANAPOLIS served the people of the United States 
    with valor and distinction throughout World War II in action 
    against enemy forces in the Pacific Theater of Operations from 7 
    December 1941 to 29 July 1945.
        (2) The fast and powerful heavy cruiser with its courageous and 
    capable crew, compiled an impressive combat record during her 
    victorious forays across the battle-torn reaches of the Pacific, 
    receiving in the process ten hard-earned Battle Stars from the 
    Aleutians to Okinawa.
        (3) This mighty ship repeatedly proved herself a swift, hard-
    hitting weapon of our Pacific Fleet, rendering invaluable service 
    in anti-shipping, shore bombardments, anti-air and invasion support 
    roles, and serving with honor and great distinction as Fifth Fleet 
    Flagship under Admiral Raymond Spruance, USN, and Third Fleet 
    Flagship under Admiral William F. Halsey, USN.
         (4) This gallant ship, owing to her superior speed and record 
    of accomplishment, transported the world's first operational atomic 
    bomb to the Island of Tinian, accomplishing her mission at a record 
    average speed of 29 knots.
         (5) Following the accomplishment of her mission, the 
    INDIANAPOLIS departed Tinian for Guam and, thereafter, embarked 
    from Guam for the Leyte Gulf where she was to join with the fleet 
    assembling for the invasion of Japan.
        (6) At 0014 hours on 30 July 1945, the USS INDIANAPOLIS was 
    sunk by enemy torpedo action.
        (7) Of the approximately 900 members of her crew of 1,198 
    officers and men who survived the initial torpedo attack, only 319 
    were eventually rescued because, as a result of the ship's 
    communication ability having been destroyed in the attack, the 
    sinking of the USS INDIANAPOLIS was not discovered for five fateful 
    days, during which the survivors suffered incessant shark attacks, 
    starvation, desperate thirst, and exposure.
        (8) From her participation in the earliest offensive actions in 
    the Pacific in World War II to becoming the last capital ship lost 
    in that conflict, the USS INDIANAPOLIS and her crew left an 
    indelible imprint on our nation's struggle to eventual victory.
        (9) This selfless and outstanding performance of duty reflects 
    great credit upon the ship and her crew, thus upholding the very 
    highest traditions of the United States Navy.
    (b) Recognition and Commendation.--Congress, acting on behalf of 
the grateful people of the United States, hereby--
        (1) recognizes the invaluable contributions of the USS 
    INDIANAPOLIS to the ending of World War II; and
        (2) on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of her tragic 
    sinking, and the dedication of her National Memorial in 
    Indianapolis on July 30th, 1995, commends this gallant ship and her 
    crew for selfless and heroic service to the United States of 
    America.

    to fight and win two major regional contingencies nearly 
    simultaneously.
        (2) The Secretary of Defense conducted the Bottom Up Review 
    during 1993 to structure the Armed Forces for the Post-Cold War 
    period.
        (3) The United States military force structure has shrunk 
    dramatically since the 1991 Persian Gulf War and some critical 
    force enhancements will not be deployed for several years.
        (4) The Secretary of Defense (in testimony before the Committee 
    on Armed Services of the Senate on February 2, 1994) stated that 
    under current inflation assumptions the Department of Defense's 
    Future Years Defense Program includes approximately $20,000,000,000 
    more in program funding requests for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 
    than the defense funding levels projected for the President's 
    budget for those years.
        (5) The Secretary of the Navy (in testimony before the 
    Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on March 8, 1994) stated 
    that by 1999 the Department of the Navy will operate only 330 
    ships, rather than the 346 ships projected in the report on the 
    Bottom Up Review.
        (6) The Secretary of Defense, in his January 1994 Annual Report 
    to the President and Congress, reported that the Air Force will 
    field approximately 100 heavy bombers, rather than the ``up to 
    184'' assumed in the report on the Bottom Up Review.
        (7) The plans of the Department of Defense for a major regional 
    contingency in the Far East call for up to 5 Army divisions and the 
    plans for a major regional contingency in Southwest Asia call for 
    up to 7 Army divisions, while the report on the Bottom Up Review 
    plans for an Army of 10 active divisions and at least 15 enhanced-
    readiness Army National Guard brigades.
        (8) The President's budget for fiscal year 1995 assumes the 
    Department of Defense will save at least $6,000,000,000 from 
    procurement reform.
        (9) The first and second rounds of the Base Realignment and 
    Closure Commission have not yet achieved the level of savings 
    initially estimated, and the 1995 base closure round may cost 
    significantly more than is assumed in the President's budget.
        (10) United States forces are presently involved in 
    humanitarian relief efforts in or around Rwanda, in a number of air 
    and maritime operations relating to the United Nations operations 
    in Bosnia, and in a variety of operations relating to Iraq, Haiti, 
    Somalia, and Macedonia.
        (11) United States forces may be called upon in the future to 
    conduct additional humanitarian and relief missions.
        (12) United States forces may be called upon to conduct even 
    more significant operations to enforce a peace agreement in Bosnia 
    and to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military 
    leadership.
        (13) Many of the forces that are participating in these other-
    than-war or nontraditional operations would be required early on in 
    the event of one or more major regional contingencies.
        (14) There are inevitable tradeoffs among spending on force 
    structure, readiness, modernization, personnel, pay, and quality of 
    life.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), 
it is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) within 30 days after enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
    of Defense should initiate a review of the assumptions and 
    conclusions of the President's budget, the report on the Bottom Up 
    Review, and the Future Years Defense Program, such review to 
    include consideration of the various other-than-war or 
    nontraditional operations in which the United States forces are or 
    may be participating;
        (2) not more than 180 days after the review is initiated, the 
    Secretary should submit to the President and Congress a report 
    which--
            (A) describes in detail the force structure required to 
        fight and win two major regional contingencies nearly 
        simultaneously in light of other ongoing or potential 
        operations;
            (B) may also address possible changes in national security 
        planning or programs, including revised alliance arrangements, 
        increased reliance on reserve component forces, or adjustments 
        to the national military strategy; and
            (C) includes an evaluation of an Army configured as 12 
        active duty divisions, a number of which would be rounded out 
        with National Guard combat units;
        (3) not more than 60 days after receipt of the report from the 
    Secretary of Defense, the President should submit to Congress a 
    report detailing the steps the President intends to take to meet 
    the force structure described in the Secretary's report;
        (4) future-years defense budgets submitted to Congress by the 
    President should reflect the funding level necessary to support the 
    force structure described in the report;
        (5) funding for national defense for fiscal years 1995 through 
    1997 should be established at a level sufficient to support a force 
    structure adequate to meet a two-war strategy and to ensure that 
    the United States does not have a hollow force;
        (6) the force structure to meet the requirements of a two-war 
    strategy represents the minimum level which should be maintained 
    unless the strategy is modified;
        (7) whenever possible and consistent with the safety of United 
    States personnel, in deploying military forces in support of 
    operations other than war or other nontraditional operations, the 
    President should seek to use forces other than those identified for 
    early deployment in the event of one or more major regional 
    contingencies; and
        (8) the President should be willing to increase defense 
    spending if required to meet new or existing threats.

SEC. 1207. REPORT ON OFFENSIVE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE PROGRAM OF THE STATES 
              OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The United States has identified nonproliferation of 
    weapons of mass destruction as a high priority in the conduct of 
    United States national security policy.
        (2) The United States is seeking universal adherence to global 
    regimes that control nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and 
    is promoting new measures that provide increased transparency of 
    biological weapons-related activities and facilities in an effort 
    to help deter violations of and enhance compliance with the 
    Biological Weapons Convention.
        (3) In early 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin indicated to 
    former United States President George Bush that Russia still had an 
    offensive biological weapons program.
        (4) A United States Government report dated January 19, 1993, 
    on arms control noncompliance noted that Russian declarations up to 
    that date had dramatically underestimated the size, scope, and 
    maturity of the former Soviet biological weapons program.
        (5) Despite President Yeltsin's decree of April 11, 1993, 
    stating that activities in violation of the Biological Weapons 
    Convention are illegal, questions continue to arise regarding 
    offensive biological weapons research, development, testing, 
    production, and storage in Russia as well as in other countries.
        (6) A United States Government report, dated June 23, 1994, 
    states the following: ``The United States has determined that the 
    offensive biological warfare program that Russia inherited from the 
    Soviet Union violated the Biological Weapons Convention through at 
    least March 1992. The Soviet offensive biological weapons program 
    was massive, and included production, weaponization, and 
    stockpiling. The status of the program since that time remains 
    unclear and the U.S. remains concerned about the Russian biological 
    warfare program.''.
        (7) The Joint Statement on Biological Weapons issued by 
    officials of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia on 
    September 14, 1992, confirmed the commitment of the three 
    governments to full compliance with the Biological Weapons 
    Convention and outlined steps designed to increase confidence in 
    that commitment.
        (8) The Presidents of Russia and the United States are 
    scheduled to hold a summit meeting in Washington during the month 
    of September 1994.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the President should continue to urge all signatories to 
    the Biological Weapons Convention to comply fully with the terms of 
    that convention and with other international agreements relating to 
    the control of biological weapons;
        (2) the President should keep the Congress fully and currently 
    informed regarding any Russian activities related to offensive 
    biological weapons;
        (3) the President should continue to insist that the Russian 
    Government complete the steps noted and agreed to in the Joint 
    Statement on Biological Weapons issued by officials of the United 
    States, the United Kingdom, and Russia on September 14, 1992;
        (4) subsequent meetings of representatives of the United 
    States, the United Kingdom, and Russia on biological weapons and 
    the September 1994 summit meeting in Washington provide 
    opportunities for the President to again emphasize the importance 
    of resolving the issues related to compliance with the Biological 
    Weapons Convention;
        (5) in assessing the President's fiscal year 1996 budget 
    request for foreign assistance funds for Russia, and for other 
    programs and activities to provide assistance to Russia, including 
    the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, Congress will consider 
    United States Government assessments of Russia's compliance with 
    its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention; and
        (6) as the President encourages increased transparency of 
    biological weapons-related activities and facilities to deter 
    violations of, and enhance compliance with, the Biological Weapons 
    Convention, the President should also take appropriate actions to 
    ensure that the United States is prepared to counter the effects of 
    use of biological weapons by others.
    (c) Presidential Reports.--Not later than February 1, 1995, not 
later than June 1, 1995, and not later than October 1, 1995, the 
President shall submit to Congress a report, in classified and 
unclassified forms, containing an assessment of the extent of 
compliance of the independent states of the former Soviet Union with 
the Biological Weapons Convention and other international agreements 
relating to the control of biological weapons.
    (d) Content of Report.--The report shall include the following:
        (1) Matters related to compliance.--
            (A) An evaluation of the extent of control and oversight by 
        the government of the Russian Federation over the former Soviet 
        military and dual civilian-military biological warfare 
        programs.
            (B) The extent, if any, of the biological warfare agent 
        stockpile in any of the independent states of the former Soviet 
        Union.
            (C) The extent and scope, if any, of continued biological 
        warfare research, development, testing, and production by such 
        states, including the sites and types of activity at those 
        sites.
            (D) An evaluation of the effectiveness of possible delivery 
        systems of biological weapons, including tube and rocket 
        artillery, aircraft, and ballistic missiles.
            (E) An assessment of measures taken by the Russian 
        Government to complete the steps noted and agreed to in the 
        1992 Joint Statement on Biological Weapons referred to in 
        subsection (b)(3), including a determination of the extent to 
        which Russia has--
                (i) agreed to permit visits to military and nonmilitary

SEC. 1208. COORDINATION OF CERTAIN COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION 
              PROGRAMS.

    (a) Military-to-Military Contact Programs.--(1) None of the funds 
authorized to be appropriated in section 301 for Cooperative Threat 
Reduction programs may be obligated for activities under a military-to-
military contact program until the Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of State submit to Congress a joint report on the 
coordination of military-to-military contact programs and comparable 
activities carried out under their respective jurisdictions.
    (2) The report shall cover the following programs and activities:

SEC. 1209. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING SAFE AND SECURE DISMANTLEMENT 
              OF SOVIET NUCLEAR ARSENAL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) It is a pressing national security challenge for the United 
    States to expedite the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear 
    arsenal of the former Soviet Union.
        (2) In particular, it is essential to expedite the return of 
    strategic nuclear warheads from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan 
    and to expedite the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear 
    delivery vehicles of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.
        (3) Leakage of nuclear materials and technology, and the 
    continuing threat of emigration of scientists and technicians from 
    the former Soviet nuclear weapons complex, pose a grave threat to 
    United States national security and to international stability.
        (4) Congress has authorized so-called ``Nunn-Lugar'' funds to 
    enable the Department of Defense to carry out cooperative 
    activities with states of the former Soviet Union to address the 
    threats described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), 
it is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State should 
    continue to give their serious attention to carrying out a 
    coordinated strategy for addressing the urgent national security 
    issues described in subsection (a);
        (2) the United States should expedite the availability and 
    effective application of so-called ``Nunn-Lugar'' funds;
        (3) although activities conducted with those funds should, to 
    the extent feasible, draw upon United States technology and 
    expertise, the United States should work with local contractors in 
    Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine when doing so would 
    expedite more effective use of those funds; and
        (4) efforts should be made to make the Science and Technology 
    Centers in Moscow and Kiev, designed to slow the emigration of 
    scientists and technicians from the former Soviet weapons complex, 
    fully operational on an expedited basis.

        TITLE XIII--MATTERS RELATING TO ALLIES AND OTHER NATIONS
                  Subtitle A--Matters Relating to NATO

SEC. 1301. COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH NATO 
              ORGANIZATIONS.

    (a) Applicability of Existing Authority to NATO Organizations.--
Section 2350a of title 10, United States Code, is amended in 
subsections (a), (e)(2), and (i)(1) by inserting ``or NATO 
organizations'' after ``major allies of the United States'' each place 
it appears.
    (b) NATO Organization Defined.--Subsection (i) of such section is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
        ``(4) The term `NATO organization' means any North Atlantic 
    Treaty Organization subsidiary body referred to in section 2350(2) 
    of this title and any other organization of the North Atlantic 
    Treaty Organization.''.

SEC. 1302. NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has served as a 
    bulwark of peace, security, and democracy for the United States and 
    the members of the alliance since 1949.
        (2) The unswerving resolve of the member states of the North 
    Atlantic Treaty Organization to mutual defense against the threat 
    of communist aggression was central to the demise of the Warsaw 
    Pact.
        (3) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the most 
    successful international security organization in history and is 
    well suited to help marshal cooperative political, diplomatic, 
    economic, and humanitarian efforts, buttressed by credible military 
    capability aimed at deterring conflict, and thus contributing to 
    international peace and security.
        (4) The threat of instability in Eastern and Central Europe, as 
    well as in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, continues to 
    pose a fundamental challenge to the interests of the member states 
    of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
        (5) North Atlantic Treaty Organization assets have been 
    deployed in recent years for more than the territorial defense of 
    alliance members, and the Rome Summit of October 1991 adopted a new 
    strategic concept for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that 
    entertained the possibility of operations beyond the alliance's 
    self-defense area.
        (6) In Oslo in July 1992, and in Brussels in December 1992, the 
    alliance embraced the deployment of North Atlantic Treaty 
    Organization forces to peacekeeping operations under the auspices 
    of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
    in Europe.
        (7) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization should attempt to 
    cooperate with and seek a mandate from international organizations 
    such as the United Nations when considering responses to crises 
    outside the alliances's self-defense area.
        (8) Not all members of the international community share a 
    commonality of interests that would ensure timely action by the 
    United Nations Security Council.
        (9) It is critical that the security interests of the member 
    countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization not be held 
    hostage to indecision at the United Nations or a veto by a 
    permanent member of the Security Council.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) it should be the policy of the United States that, in 
    accordance with article 53 of the United Nations Charter, the North 
    Atlantic Treaty Organization retains the right of autonomy of 
    action regarding missions in addition to collective defense should 
    the United Nations Security Council or the Conference on Security 
    and Cooperation in Europe fail to act;
        (2) while it is desirable to work with other international 
    organizations and arrangements where feasible in dealing with 
    threats to the peace, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not 
    an auxiliary to the United Nations or any other organization; and
        (3) the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
    reserve the right to act collectively in defense of their vital 
    interests.

SEC. 1303. AUTHORIZED END STRENGTH FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL IN EUROPE.

    (a) End Strength.--Paragraph (1) of section 1002(c) of the 
Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(1) The end strength level of members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member 
nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may not exceed a 
permanent ceiling of approximately 100,000 in any fiscal year.''.
    (b) Exclusion of Certain Island-Based Troops in Calculation of 
Authorized End Strength.--Such section is further amended by adding at 
the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, members of the Armed Forces 
of the United States assigned to permanent duty ashore in Iceland, 
Greenland, and the Azores are excluded in calculating the end strength 
level of members of the Armed Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore 
in European member nations of NATO.''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1303 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 106 Stat. 
2546) is repealed.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on October 1, 1995.

SEC. 1304. ALLIED SHARE OF INSTALLATIONS COSTS.

    (a) Goal for Allied Contributions.--In continuing efforts to enter 
into revised host-nation agreements as described in section 1301(e) of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 
102-484; 106 Stat. 2545) and section 1401(c) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 107 Stat. 
1824), the President shall seek to have European member nations of NATO 
assume an increased share of the nonpersonnel costs for United States 
military installations in those nations so that by September 30, 1996, 
those nations have assumed 37.5 percent of such costs.
    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term ``nonpersonnel costs'', with respect to United 
    States military installations in European member nations of NATO, 
    means costs for those installations other than costs paid from 
    military personnel accounts.
        (2) The term ``contributions'', with respect to the share of 
    such nonpersonnel costs assumed by the European member nations of 
    NATO, means those cash and in-kind contributions made by such 
    nations that replace expenditures that would otherwise be made by 
    the Secretary using funds appropriated or otherwise made available 
    in defense appropriations Acts.

SEC. 1305. PAYMENTS-IN-KIND FOR RELEASE OF UNITED STATES OVERSEAS 
              MILITARY FACILITIES TO NATO HOST COUNTRIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The United States has invested $6,500,000,000 in military 
    infrastructure in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
    countries.
        (2) As part of an overall plan to reduce United States troop 
    strength overseas, the Department of Defense plans to close, or 
    reduce United States military presence at, 867 military sites 
    outside the United States.
        (3) Most of the military sites outside the United States 
    announced for closure are in Europe, where the United States has 
    already closed 434 such sites while carrying out a reduction in 
    troop strength in Europe from 323,432 in 1987 to approximately 
    100,000 by the end of fiscal year 1996.
        (4) When the United States closes military sites in Europe, it 
    leaves buildings, roads, sewers, and other real property 
    improvements behind.
        (5) Some of the European NATO allies have agreed to pay the 
    United States for the residual value of the real property 
    improvements left behind.
        (6) Although the United States military drawdown has been rapid 
    since 1990, European allies have been slow to pay the United States 
    the residual value of the sites released by the United States.
        (7) As of 1994, the United States has recouped only $33,300,000 
    in cash, most of which was recovered in 1989.
        (8) Although the United States has released to Germany over 60 
    percent of the military sites planned for closure by the United 
    States in that country and the current value of United States 
    facilities to be returned to the German government is estimated at 
    approximately $2,700,000,000, the German government has budgeted 
    only $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 for payment of compensation 
    for the United States investment in those facilities.
    (b) Policy.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the President should redouble efforts to recover the value 
    of the United States investment in the military infrastructure in 
    NATO countries;
        (2) the President should enter into negotiations with the 
    government of each NATO host country with a presumption that 
    payments to compensate the United States for the negotiated value 
    of improvements will be made in cash and deposited in the 
    Department of Defense Overseas Military Facility Investment 
    Recovery Account;
        (3) the President should enter into negotiations for payments-
    in-kind only as a last resort and only after informing the Congress 
    that negotiations for cash payments have not been successful; and
        (4) to the extent that in-kind contributions are received in 
    lieu of cash payments in any fiscal year, the in-kind contributions 
    should be used for projects that are identified priorities of the 
    Department of Defense.
    (c) Requirements and Limitations Relating to Payments-in-Kind.--(1) 
Subsection (e) of section 2921 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2687 note) is amended--
        (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``Negotiations for Payments-in-
    Kind.--'';
        (B) by striking out ``a written notice'' and all that follows 
    and inserting in lieu thereof ``to the appropriate congressional 
    committees a written notice regarding the intended negotiations.''; 
    and
        (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
    ``(2) The notice shall contain the following:
        ``(A) A justification for entering into negotiations for 
    payments-in-kind with the host country.
        ``(B) The types of benefit options to be pursued by the 
    Secretary in the negotiations.
        ``(C) A discussion of the adjustments that are intended to be 
    made in the future-years defense program or in the budget of the 
    Department of Defense for the fiscal year in which the notice is 
    submitted or the following fiscal year in order to reflect costs 
    that it may no longer be necessary for the United States to incur 
    as a result of the payments-in-kind to be sought in the 
    negotiations.
    ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the appropriate 
congressional committees are--
        ``(A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
    Appropriations, and the Defense Subcommittees of the Committee on 
    Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and
        ``(B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
    Appropriations, and the Defense Subcommittees of the Committee on 
    Appropriations of the Senate.''.
    (2) Such section is further amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(h) Congressional Oversight of Payments-In-Kind.--(1) Not less 
than 30 days before concluding an agreement for acceptance of military 
construction or facility improvements as a payment-in-kind, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a notification on the 
proposed agreement. Any such notification shall contain the following:
        ``(A) A description of the military construction project or 
    facility improvement project, as the case may be.
        ``(B) A certification that the project is needed by United 
    States forces.
        ``(C) An explanation of how the project will aid in the 
    achievement of the mission of those forces.
        ``(D) A certification that, if the project were to be carried 
    out by the Department of Defense, appropriations would be necessary 
    for the project and it would be necessary to provide for the 
    project in the next future-years defense program.
    ``(2) Not less than 30 days before concluding an agreement for 
acceptance of host nation support or host nation payment of operating 
costs of United States forces as a payment-in-kind, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to Congress a notification on the proposed 
agreement. Any such notification shall contain the following:
        ``(A) A description of each activity to be covered by the 
    payment-in-kind.
        ``(B) A certification that the costs to be covered by the 
    payment-in-kind are included in the budget of one or more of the 
    military departments or that it will otherwise be necessary to 
    provide for payment of such costs in a budget of one or more of the 
    military departments.
        ``(C) A certification that, unless the payment-in-kind is 
    accepted or funds are appropriated for payment of such costs, the 
    military mission of the United States forces with respect to the 
    host nation concerned will be adversely affected.''.

SEC. 1306. GEORGE C. MARSHALL EUROPEAN CENTER FOR SECURITY STUDIES.

    (a) Use of Contributions.--Funds received by the United States 
Government from the Federal Republic of Germany as its fair share of 
the costs of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security 
Studies shall be credited to appropriations available to the Department 
of Defense for the George C. Marshall European Center for Security 
Studies. Funds so credited shall be merged with the appropriations to 
which credited and shall be available for the Center for the same 
purposes and the same period as the appropriations with which merged.
    (b) Waiver of Charges.--(1) The Secretary of Defense may waive 
reimbursement of the costs of conferences, seminars, courses of 
instruction, or similar educational activities of the George C. 
Marshall European Center for Security Studies for military officers and 
civilian officials of cooperation partner states of the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council or the Partnership for Peace if the Secretary 
determines that attendance by such personnel without reimbursement is 
in the national security interest of the United States.
    (2) Costs for which reimbursement is waived pursuant to paragraph 
(1) shall be paid from appropriations available for the Center.

SEC. 1307. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING PARTICIPATION IN ALLIED 
              DEFENSE COOPERATION.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the President should use 
existing authorities to the greatest extent possible to authorize the

SEC. 1315. REVIEW AND REPORT REGARDING DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PROGRAMS 
              RELATING TO REGIONAL SECURITY AND HOST NATION DEVELOPMENT 
              IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The political environment in the Western Hemisphere has 
    been characterized in recent years by significant democratic 
    advances and an absence of international strife, but democracy in 
    some nations of the region is fragile.
        (2) It is desirable for the Department of Defense to perform a 
    positive role in influencing the defense establishments and 
    military forces of nations in the Western Hemisphere to make 
    positive contributions to the democratic process and to domestic 
    development programs of their respective nations.
        (3) Congress receives a number of annual reports relating to 
    specific authorities granted to the Secretary of Defense under 
    title 10, United States Code, such as the authorities relating to 
    the conduct of bilateral or regional cooperation programs under 
    section 1051 of that title, participation of developing countries 
    in combined exercises under section 2010 of that title, and the 
    training of special operations forces with friendly forces under 
    section 2011 of that title.
        (4) The annual reports are replete with statistics and dollar 
    figures and generally lacking in substance.
        (5) Congress does not receive annual reports with respect to 
    other authorities of the Secretary of Defense, such as that 
    relating to Latin American cooperation under section 1050 of title 
    10, United States Code.
        (6) Testimony before Congress (including in particular the 
    testimony of the commander of the United States Southern Command 
    and the commander of the United States Atlantic Command) has 
    emphasized the conduct of a large number of complementary programs 
    under the leadership and supervision of those two commanders to 
    foster appropriate military roles in democratic host nations and to 
    assist countries in developing forces properly trained to address 
    their security needs, including needs regarding illegal 
    immigration, insurgencies, smuggling of illegal arms, munitions, 
    and explosives across borders, and drug trafficking.
        (7) Most of the programs referred to in paragraph (6) provide 
    excellent and often unique training and experience to the United 
    States forces involved.
        (8) Military-to-military contact programs in the Western 
    Hemisphere provide another tool to encourage a democratic 
    orientation of the defense establishments and military forces of 
    countries in the region.
        (9) There is a need for the Secretary of Defense to conduct a 
    comprehensive review of the several authorities in title 10, United 
    States Code, for the Secretary of Defense to engage in cooperative 
    regional security programs with other countries in the Western 
    Hemisphere in order to determine whether the authorities continue 
    to be appropriate and necessary, particularly in the light of the 
    changed circumstances in the region.
        (10) There is a need for the Secretary of Defense to conduct a 
    comprehensive review of various programs carried out pursuant to 
    such authorities to ensure that such programs are designed to meet 
    the needs of the host nations involved and the regional strategic 
    and foreign policy objectives of the United States, including 
    promotion of sustainable development, effective control of the 
    military by elected civilian authorities, reliable regional 
    security accords, and the appropriate role for militaries in 
    democratic societies.
        (11) There is a need for the Secretary of Defense to assess the 
    strengths and weaknesses of the various regional security 
    organizations, defense forums, and defense education institutions 
    in the Western Hemisphere in order to identify any improvements 
    needed to harmonize the defense policies of the United States and 
    those of friendly nations of the region.
    (b) Review and Report.--Not later than May 1, 1995, the Secretary 
of Defense, shall--
        (1) in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
    Staff and the commanders of the combatant commands responsible for 
    regions in the Western Hemisphere, carry out a comprehensive review 
    and assessment of the matters referred to in paragraphs (2), (9), 
    (10), and (11) of subsection (a); and
        (2) submit to Congress a report on the review and assessment 
    carried out pursuant to paragraph (1).
    (c) Content of Report.--The report shall contain a detailed and 
comprehensive description, discussion, and analysis of the following:
        (1) The Department of Defense plan to support United States 
    strategic objectives in the Western Hemisphere.
        (2) The external and internal threats to the national security 
    of the nations of the region.
        (3) The various regional security cooperative programs carried 
    out by the Department of Defense in the region in 1994, including 
    training and education programs in the host nations and in the 
    United States and defense contacts set forth on a country-by-
    country basis, the statutory authority, if any, for such programs, 
    and the strategic objectives served.
        (4) The various regional security organizations, defense 
    forums, and defense education institutions that the United States 
    maintains or in which the United States participates.
        (5) The contribution that such programs, defense contacts, 
    organizations, forums, and institutions make to the advancement of 
    regional security, host nation security and national development, 
    United States strategic objectives, and United States foreign 
    policy objectives as described in paragraph (10) of subsection (a).
        (6) United States humanitarian civic assistance and civic 
    action programs conducted with host countries in the region and the 
    effect that those programs have had in furthering the objectives 
    described in paragraph (10) of subsection (a).
        (7) The changes made or to be made in the programs, 
    organizations, forums, and institutions referred to in paragraphs 
    (3), (4), (5), and (6) as a result of the comprehensive review.
    (d) Recommended Legislation.--The report shall include any 
recommendations for legislation that the Secretary considers necessary 
to improve the ability of the Department to achieve its strategic

           Subtitle C--Matters Relating to Specific Countries

SEC. 1321. DEFENSE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The President has reiterated the long-standing United 
    States commitment to maintaining the qualitative superiority of the 
    Israeli Defense Force over any combination of adversaries.
        (2) Congress continues to recognize the many benefits to the 
    United States from its strategic relationship with Israel, 
    including enhancing regional stability and technical cooperation.
        (3) Despite the momentous peace process in which Israel and its 
    neighbors are productively engaged, Israel continues to face 
    difficult threats to its national security that are compounded by 
    the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic 
    missiles.
        (4) Congress is supportive of the objective of the President to 
    enhance United States-Israel military and technical cooperation, 
    particularly in the areas of missile defense and counter-
    proliferation.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the President should ensure that any conventional defense 
    system or technology offered for release to any NATO or other major 
    non-NATO ally should concurrently be available for purchase by 
    Israel unless such action would contravene United States national 
    interests; and
        (2) the President should make available to Israel, within 
    existing technology transfer laws, regulations, and policies, 
    advanced United States technology necessary for continued progress 
    in cooperative United States-Israel research and development of 
    theater missile defenses.

SEC. 1322. READINESS OF MILITARY FORCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Under existing security arrangements between the United 
    States and the Republic of Korea, responsibility for the defense of 
    the territory of the Republic of Korea is allocated so that the 
    Republic of Korea has primary responsibility for the ground defense 
    of its territory and the United States has primary responsibility 
    for air and sea defense of the Korean peninsula and for 
    reinforcement.
        (2) The Force Improvement Program of the Republic of Korea has 
    not fully addressed critical shortfalls in its ground force 
    capability which continue to exist even though the Republic of 
    Korea spends approximately $12,000,000,000 annually on defense 
    while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea spends 
    approximately $4,000,000,000 annually on defense. The Republic of 
    Korea has directed substantial defense resources to procuring 
    submarines, destroyers, advanced aircraft, and other military 
    systems that are marginal to its primary ground defense 
    responsibility.
        (3) The defense acquisition decisions of the Republic of Korea 
    have had the effect of not allowing the Republic of Korea to attain 
    self-sufficiency in its ground defense responsibility. As a result, 
    there exists an undue burden on the United States for the ground 
    defense of the Korean peninsula.
        (4) The lack of intelligence capability to forecast the 
    military intentions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
    presents major problems for the combined United States-Republic of 
    Korea defense of South Korea.
        (5) A short-warning attack by the Democratic People's Republic 
    of Korea would cause major losses to the combined United States-
    Republic of Korea ground force.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should urge the Republic of Korea to continue to improve its 
military ground forces with emphasis on counterartillery capabilities, 
defense against ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, 
combined United States-Republic of Korea logistics capabilities, 
combined United States-Republic of Korea medical support, and combined 
United States-Republic of Korea capabilities for tactical intelligence 
and indications and warning of a North Korean attack.
    (c) Report.--Not later than January 15, 1995, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to Congress a report, in classified form, on--
        (1) the readiness of the military forces of the Republic of 
    Korea to defeat an attack by the military forces of the Democratic 
    People's Republic of Korea; and
        (2) the adequacy of the defense acquisition strategy of the 
    Republic of Korea to meet its primary ground defense mission.

SEC. 1323. MILITARY PLANNING FOR THE SIZE AND STRUCTURE OF A FORCE 
              REQUIRED FOR A MAJOR REGIONAL CONTINGENCY ON THE KOREAN 
              PENINSULA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The Secretary of Defense conducted the Bottom-Up Review 
    during 1993 to establish the size and structure for the Armed 
    Forces for the Post-Cold-War era.
        (2) The report on the Bottom-Up Review cites the need for the 
    Armed Forces to be large enough to prevail in two major regional 
    conflicts ``nearly simultaneously''.
        (3) The report on the Bottom-Up Review gives special 
    consideration to a scenario that hypothesizes that the two ``nearly 
    simultaneous'' conflicts would occur in Korea and the Persian Gulf.
        (4) The United States sent 7 Army divisions, the equivalent of 
    10 Air Force tactical fighter wings, 70 heavy bombers, 6 Navy 
    aircraft carrier battle groups, and 5 Marine Corps brigades to the 
    Persian Gulf to fight the war against Iraq.
        (5) The report on the Bottom-Up Review asserts that the forces 
    needed to fight two conflicts similar to that with Iraq can be 
    drawn from a total military force of between 15 and 16 Army 
    divisions, 20 Air Force tactical fighter wings, up to 184 heavy 
    bombers, 11 active Navy aircraft carriers (along with one reserve/
    training carrier), and the equivalent of 12 Marine Corps brigades.
        (6) The report on the Bottom-Up Review recognizes that 
    approximately 100,000 members of the Armed Forces will be stationed 
    in Europe.
        (7) The report on the Bottom-Up Review recognizes that sizeable 
    numbers of United States forces could be involved in peace 
    enforcement and intervention operations at any one time.
        (8) The report on the Bottom-Up Review makes no specific 
    recommendation as to the number of forces to be held in reserve to 
    provide a rotation base either to relieve troops in the event one 
    or both hypothetical conflicts result in lengthy deployments or to 
    replace combat losses.
        (9) Military planners calculate that 430,000 or more United 
    States military personnel may be needed to win a war with North 
    Korea begun by an invasion of South Korea by North Korea.
        (10) In a worst case scenario, the size of the force military 
    planners may request to help defend South Korea could exceed the 
    levels that are consistent with the recommendations of the report 
    on the Bottom-Up Review if the existing and future force 
    requirements for a presence in Europe, possible peace enforcement 
    operations, and an adequate rotation base, as well as a second 
    regional conflict, must be fulfilled simultaneously.
        (11) The Bottom-Up Review was conducted for the purpose of 
    force-sizing and was not meant to constrain operational planning.
    (b) Sense of Congress Concerning BUR.--It is the sense of Congress 
that--
        (1) the force structure identified in the report on the Bottom-
    Up Review should not be used to limit the size or structure of the 
    force that United States military commanders may request in 
    preparation for a major regional contingency on the Korean 
    peninsula; and
        (2) the conclusions of the Bottom-Up Review should be 
    continuously examined in light of the lessons learned from 
    preparation for a major regional contingency on the Korean 
    peninsula and from other military operations.
    (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Situation on Korean Peninsula.--It 
is the sense of Congress that the chairmen and ranking minority members 
of the Committees on Armed Services and chairmen and ranking minority 
members of the Appropriations Subcommittees on Defense of the Senate 
and House of Representatives should receive regular briefings from the 
Secretary of Defense on the situation on the Korean peninsula.

SEC. 1324. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR 
              WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Between 1950 and 1953, the United States led a military 
    coalition that successfully repelled an invasion of the Republic of 
    Korea by North Korea, at a cost of more than 54,000 American lives.
        (2) The United States and the Republic of Korea ratified a 
    Mutual Security Treaty in 1954 that commits the United States to 
    helping the Republic of Korea defend itself against external 
    aggression.
        (3) Approximately 37,000 United States military personnel are 
    presently stationed in the Republic of Korea.
        (4) The United States and the Republic of Korea have regularly 
    conducted joint military exercises, including ``Team Spirit'' 
    exercises.
        (5) North Korea has built up an armed force nearly twice the 
    size of that in the Republic of Korea and has not renounced the use 
    of force, terrorism, and subversion in its attempts to subdue and 
    subjugate the Republic of Korea.
        (6) Although North Korea signed the Treaty on the Non-
    Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1985, it has impeded the 
    international inspection of its nuclear facilities that is required 
    of all signatories of that Treaty.
        (7) North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile 
    programs represent a grave threat to the security of the Korean 
    peninsula and the entire world.
        (8) Efforts in recent years by the United States to reduce 
    tensions on the Korean peninsula have included--
            (A) the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from the 
        territory of the Republic of Korea and a reduction in the 
        number of United States military personnel stationed there;
            (B) the postponement of the 1994 Team Spirit exercises;
            (C) the establishment of direct diplomatic contacts with 
        the North Korean government; and
            (D) the offer of expanded diplomatic and economic contacts 
        with North Korea.
        (9) Weapons-grade plutonium can be extracted from the fuel rods 
    removed from North Korea's principal reactor at Yongbyon.
        (10) International inspectors were not permitted to examine and 
    test in a timely manner spent fuel rods removed from North Korea's 
    principal nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, as required to ensure 
    compliance with North Korea's obligations under the Nuclear Non-
    Proliferation Treaty.
        (11) Diplomacy concerning the North Korean nuclear program has 
    clearly reached a crucial stage, the unsatisfactory resolution of 
    which would place the international nonproliferation regime in 
    jeopardy and threaten the peace and security of the Korean 
    peninsula, the Northeast Asia region, and, by extension, the rest 
    of the world.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the announced freeze on the North Korean nuclear program 
    should remain in place until internationally agreed-upon safeguards 
    of any North Korean civilian nuclear program can be made fully 
    effective;
        (2) the North Korean government should take a further step 
    toward verified cooperation with the international nonproliferation 
    regime by--
            (A) permitting the unfettered international inspection and 
        testing of the spent fuel rods removed from North Korea's 
        nuclear reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, followed by 
        adequate international supervision of the transfer of all spent 
        fuel rods from the Yongbyon complex and their disposal in 
        another country; and
            (B) accepting a comprehensive inspection process as 
        required by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
        Weapons;
        (3) a resolution of the inspection controversy at the Yongbyon 
    complex that allows for anything less than the full international 
    inspection of facilities in that complex required by North Korea's 
    obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--
            (A) would be unsatisfactory; and
            (B) should prompt the Government of the United States to 
        take such action as would indicate the severity with which the 
        United States views this provocation against international 
        norms; and
        (4) such action should include (but not necessarily be limited 
    to)--
            (A) the seeking of international sanctions against North 
        Korea; and
            (B) the rescheduling of the Team Spirit exercises for 1994.

    Japan, including Okinawa, that have been transferred to Japan in 
    the previous 10 years.

    Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina.
    (b) Statement of Support.--The Congress supports the efforts of the 
Contact Group to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict in 
Bosnia and Hercegovina based upon the Contact Group proposal.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:
        (1) The United States should work with the member nations of 
    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and with other permanent 
    members of the United Nations Security Council to bring about a 
    peaceful settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina which 
    maintains the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Hercegovina.
        (2) A peaceful settlement of the conflict must preserve an 
    economically, politically, and militarily viable Bosnian state 
    capable of exercising its rights under the Charter of the United 
    Nations as part of a peaceful settlement, which rights include the 
    inherent right of a sovereign state to self defense.
        (3) The acceptance of the Contact Group proposal by the 
    Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina should lead to the lifting of 
    the Bosnia arms embargo.
        (4) In providing weapons to the Bosnian Government or taking 
    other actions, care should be taken to provide for the safety of 
    the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the civilian 
    personnel working for the United Nations or nongovernmental 
    volunteer organizations.
        (5) The United States should immediately seek to organize an 
    international effort to provide assistance to the states bordering 
    Serbia and Montenegro to bring about more effective enforcement by 
    those states of the international economic sanctions on the 
    Government of Serbia and Montenegro.
    (d) General United States Policy.--The United States should 
exercise leadership within the international community to cause the 
Bosnian Serb faction to accept the Contact Group proposal. Such action 
should be taken on separate but complementary international and 
unilateral tracks, as set forth in subsections (e), (f), and (g).
    (e) International Policy.--If the Bosnian Serbs do not accept the 
Contact Group proposal by the date that is the later of October 15, 
1994, or the end of the 10-day period beginning on the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President (or his representative) should, 
not later than 14 days thereafter, formally introduce and support in 
the United Nations Security Council a resolution to terminate the 
Bosnia arms embargo. The resolution should provide for the termination 
of the arms embargo no later than December 1, 1994 (and may allow for 
the termination to be accomplished in stages ending no later than that 
date).
    (f) Unilateral United States Policy.--(1) If by the earlier of 
November 15, 1994, or the end of the 15-day period beginning on the 
date on which a resolution described in subsection (e) (or a similar 
resolution) is formally introduced, the United Nations Security Council 
has not agreed to such a resolution and the Bosnian Serbs have not 
accepted the Contact Group proposal--
        (A) the funding limitation specified in paragraph (2) shall be 
    in effect;
        (B) the President shall submit a plan to, and shall consult 
    with, Congress on the manner in which United States Armed Forces 
    and the military forces of friendly states would provide training 
    to the armed forces of the Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina 
    outside of the territory of Bosnia and Hercegovina; and
        (C) the President shall submit a plan to, and shall consult 
    with, Congress regarding the unilateral termination by the United 
    States of compliance with the Bosnia arms embargo and the 
    implications thereof.
    (2) If the funding limitation specified in this paragraph is in 
effect pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), then no funds appropriated by any 
provision of law may be used for the purpose of participation in, 
support for, or assistance to the enforcement of the Bosnia arms 
embargo by any Department, agency or other entity of the United States 
(or by any officer or employee of the United States or member of the 
Armed Forces of the United States) other than as required of all United 
Nations member states under the United Nations Security Council 
resolution referred to in subsection (h)(3) and the Charter of the 
United Nations.
    (3)(A) The President may waive the limitation in paragraph (2) in 
the case of United States military personnel serving in NATO 
headquarters positions.
    (B) Nothing in paragraph (2) is intended to impede enforcement of 
sanctions against Serbia.
    (g) Interim Policy.--If the Bosnian Serb faction attacks any area 
within those areas that have been designated by the United Nations as 
``safe areas'', the President (or his representative) should promptly 
formally introduce and support in the United Nations Security Council a 
resolution that authorizes a selective lifting of the Bosnia arms 
embargo in order to allow the provision of defensive weapons (such as 
anti-tank weapons, counter-battery radars, and mortars) to enable the 
forces of the Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina to defend the safe 
areas.
    (h) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
        (1) The term ``Contact Group'' means the group composed of 
    representatives of the United States, Russia, France, Britain, and 
    Germany seeking to bring about a peaceful settlement of the 
    conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina.
        (2) The term ``Contact Group proposal'' means the peace 
    proposal of the Contact Group that has been agreed to by the 
    Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina and rejected by the Bosnian 
    Serb faction.
        (3) The term ``Bosnia arms embargo'' means application to the 
    Government of Bosnia and Hercegovina of the arms embargo imposed by 
    United Nations Security Council resolution 713, of September 25, 
    1991.

SEC. 1508. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING INDEFINITE EXTENSION OF NUCLEAR 
              NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 
    signed at Washington, D.C., London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968, is 
    the centerpiece of global efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear 
    weapons.
        (2) The United States has demonstrated longstanding support for 
    that treaty and related efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear 
    weapons.
        (3) President Clinton has declared that preventing the spread 
    of nuclear weapons is one of the highest priorities of his 
    Administration.
        (4) In April 1995, the parties to the Treaty on the Non-
    Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will convene a conference in New 
    York City to discuss the indefinite extension of the treaty.
        (5) The policy of the President is to seek at that conference 
    the indefinite and unconditional extension of that treaty.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the President has the full support of Congress in seeking 
    the indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the 
    Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;
        (2) the President, when formulating and implementing other 
    elements of nonproliferation policy of the United States (including 
    United States counterproliferation doctrine, the Nuclear Posture 
    Review, and nuclear testing policy), should take into account the 
    objectives of the United States at the 1995 conference of the 
    parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 
    and
        (3) the President and the President's senior national security 
    advisers should dedicate themselves to ensuring the indefinite and 
    unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
    Nuclear Weapons at the 1995 conference for that treaty.

SEC. 1509. NEGOTIATION OF LIMITATIONS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On January 25, 1994, the United States and 37 other nations 
    began negotiations for a comprehensive treaty to ban permanently 
    all nuclear weapons testing.
        (2) On March 14, 1994, the President extended the current 
    United States moratorium on nuclear weapons testing through 
    September 1995.
        (3) The United States is seeking to extend indefinitely the 
    Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons at the 
    conference of the parties to the Treaty to be held in New York City 
    in April 1995.
        (4) Conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty could 
    contribute toward successful negotiations to extend the Treaty on 
    the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
        (5) Agreements to eliminate nuclear weapons testing and to 
    control the spread of nuclear weapons could contribute to the 
    national security of the United States, its allies, and other 
    nations around the world.
    (b) Statement of Congressional Policy.--In view of the findings set 
forth in subsection (a), Congress--
        (1) applauds the President for maintaining the United States 
    moratorium on nuclear weapons testing and for taking a leadership 
    role toward negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty;
        (2) encourages all nuclear powers to refrain from conducting 
    nuclear explosions, before the conclusion of a comprehensive 
    nuclear test ban treaty; and
        (3) urges the Conference on Disarmament to make all possible 
    progress toward a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty by the end 
    of 1994.

the military department concerned shall establish a promotion zone for 
officers serving in each grade and competitive category to be 
considered by the board.
    ``(b) Number in the Zone.--The Secretary concerned shall determine 
the number of officers in the promotion zone for officers serving in 
any grade and competitive category from among officers who are eligible 
for promotion in that grade and competitive category under the 
provisions of sections 14303 and 14304 of this title and who are

requiring that the promotion zone for consideration of officers on the 
reserve active-status list of the Navy or the Marine Corps for 
promotion to the next higher grade be determined in accordance with a 
running mate system as provided in subsection (b).
    ``(b) Assignment of Running Mates.--An officer to whom a running 
mate system applies shall be assigned as a running mate an officer of 
the same grade on the active-duty list of the same armed force. The 
officer on the reserve active-status list is in the promotion zone and 
is eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade by 
a selection board convened under section 14101(a) of this title when 
that officer's running mate is in or above the promotion zone 
established for that officer's grade under chapter 36 of this title.

System.--If the Secretary of the Navy authorizes the selection of

    ``(a) Determination of Maximum Number.--Before convening a 
promotion board under section 14101(a) of this title for a grade and 
competitive category (other than a vacancy promotion board), the 
Secretary of the military department concerned, under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, shall determine the maximum 
number of officers in that grade and competitive category that the 
board may recommend for promotion. The Secretary shall make the 
determination under the preceding sentence of the maximum number that 
may be recommended with a view to having on the reserve active-status 
list a sufficient number of officers in each grade and competitive 
category to meet the needs of the armed force concerned for officers on 
that list. In order to make that determination, the Secretary shall 
determine (1) the number of positions needed to accomplish mission 
objectives which require officers of such competitive category in the 
grade to which the board will recommend officers for promotion, (2) the 
estimated number of officers needed to fill vacancies in such positions 
during the period in which it is anticipated that officers selected for 
promotion will be promoted, (3) the number of officers authorized by 
the Secretary of the military department concerned to serve on the 
reserve active-status list in the grade and competitive category under 
consideration, and (4) any statutory limitation on the number of 
officers in any grade or category (or combination thereof) authorized 
to be on the reserve active-status list.

of the Army or Air Force, in a grade above first lieutenant on the 
reserve active-status list of the Marine Corps, or in a grade above 
lieutenant (junior grade) on the reserve active-status list of the 
Navy, for promotion to the next higher grade from below the promotion 
zone.

the Secretary shall establish the number of officers that may be 
recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone in each 
competitive category to be considered. That number may not exceed the 
number equal to 10 percent of the maximum number of officers that the 
board is authorized to recommend for promotion in such competitive 
category, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize a greater 
number, not to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers that 
the board is authorized to recommend for promotion, if the Secretary of 
Defense determines that the needs of the armed force concerned so 
require. If the maximum number determined under this paragraph is less 
than one, the board may recommend one officer for promotion from below 
the promotion zone.

the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of officers 
that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion under 
subsection (a).

the officer would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the 
Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for 
promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a 
determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective 
date of pay and allowances, and position on the reserve active-status 
list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.
    ``(b) Delay for Lack of Qualifications.--Under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned, the 
appointment of an officer to a higher grade may also be delayed if 
there is cause to believe that the officer is mentally, physically, 
morally, or professionally unqualified to perform the duties of the 
grade to which selected. If the Secretary concerned later determines 
that the officer is qualified for promotion to the higher grade, the 
officer shall be retained on the promotion list, the list of officers 
found qualified for Federal recognition, or list of officers nominated 
by the President to the Senate for appointment in a higher reserve 
grade, and shall, upon promotion to that grade, have the same date of 
rank, the same effective date for pay and allowances of that grade, and 
the same position on the reserve active-status list as the officer 
would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary 
concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for 
any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the 
Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and 
allowances, and position on the reserve active-status list as the 
Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.
    ``(c) Notice to Officer.--(1) The appointment of an officer to a 
higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or (b) unless the 
officer is given written notice of the grounds for the delay. The 
preceding sentence does not apply if it is impracticable to give the 
officer written notice before the date on which the appointment to the 
higher grade would otherwise take effect, but in such a case the 
written notice shall be given as soon as practicable.
    ``(2) An officer whose promotion is delayed under subsection (a) or 
(b) shall be given an opportunity to make a written statement to the 
Secretary of the military department concerned in response to the 
action taken. The Secretary shall give consideration to any such 
statement.
    ``(d) Maximum Length of Delay in Promotion.--The appointment of an 
officer to a higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or 
(b) for more than six months after the date on which the officer would 
otherwise have been promoted unless the Secretary concerned specifies a 
further period of delay. An officer's appointment may not be delayed 
more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any criminal 
case against the officer in a Federal or State court of competent 
jurisdiction or more than 90 days after final action has been taken in 
any court-martial case against the officer. Except for court action, a 
promotion may not be delayed more than 18 months after the date on 
which the officer would otherwise have been promoted.
    ``(e) Delay Because of Limitations on Officer Strength in Grade or 
Duties to Which Assigned.--(1) Under regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of Defense, the promotion of a reserve officer on the reserve 
active-status list who is serving on active duty, or who is on full-
time National Guard duty for administration of the reserves or the 
National Guard, to a grade to which the strength limitations of section 
12011 of this title apply shall be delayed if necessary to ensure 
compliance with those strength limitations. The delay shall expire when 
the Secretary determines that the delay is no longer required to ensure 
such compliance.
    ``(2) The promotion of an officer described in paragraph (1) shall 
also be delayed while the officer is on duty described in that 
paragraph unless the Secretary of the military department concerned, 
under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, determines 
that the duty assignment of the officer requires a higher grade than 
the grade currently held by the officer.
    ``(3) The date of rank and position on the reserve active-status 
list of a reserve officer whose promotion to or Federal recognition in 
the next higher grade was delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) solely as 
the result of the limitations imposed under the regulations prescribed 
by the Secretary of Defense or contained in section 12011 of this title 
shall be the date on which the officer would have been promoted to or 
recognized in the higher grade had such limitations not existed.
    ``(4) If an officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) 
or (2) completes the period of active duty or full-time National Guard 
duty that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a 
member of a reserve component, the officer may request release from 
active duty or full-time National Guard duty. If the request is 
granted, the officer's promotion shall be effective upon the officer's 
release from such duty. The date of rank and position on the reserve 
active-status list of the officer shall be the date the officer would 
have been promoted to or recognized in the higher grade had the 
limitations imposed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of 
Defense contained in section 12011 of this title not existed. If an 
officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) has not 
completed the period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty 
that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a 
member of a reserve component, the officer may be retained on active 
duty or on full-time National Guard duty in the grade in which the 
officer was serving before the officer's being found qualified for 
Federal recognition or the officer's selection for the promotion until 
the officer completes that required period of duty.

``Sec. 14312. Delay of promotion: voluntary

    ``(a) Authority for Voluntary Delays.--(1) The Secretary of the 
military department concerned may, by regulation, permit delays of a 
promotion of an officer who is recommended for promotion by a mandatory 
selection board convened under section 14101(a) or a special selection 
board convened under section 14502 of this title at the request of the 
officer concerned. Such delays, in the case of any promotion, may 
extend for any period not to exceed three years from the date on which 
the officer would otherwise be promoted.
    ``(2) Regulations under this section shall provide that--
        ``(A) a request for such a delay of promotion must be submitted 
    by the officer concerned before the delay may be approved; and
        ``(B) denial of such a request shall not be considered to be a 
    failure of selection for promotion unless the officer declines to 
    accept a promotion under circumstances set forth in subsection (c).
    ``(b) Effect of Approval of Request.--If a request for delay of a 
promotion under subsection (a) is approved, the officer's name shall 
remain on the promotion list during the authorized period of delay 
(unless removed under any other provision of law). Upon the end of the 
period of the authorized delay, or at any time during such period, the 
officer may accept the promotion, which shall be effective on the date 
of acceptance. Such an acceptance of a promotion shall be made in 
accordance with regulations prescribed under this section.
    ``(c) Effect of Declining a Promotion.--An officer's name shall be 
removed from the promotion list and, if the officer is serving in a 
grade below colonel or, in the case of the Navy, captain, the officer 
shall be considered to have failed of selection for promotion if any of 
the following applies:
        ``(1) The Secretary concerned has not authorized voluntary 
    delays of promotion under subsection (a) to the grade concerned and 
    the officer declines to accept an appointment to a higher grade.
        ``(2) The Secretary concerned has authorized voluntary delays 
    of promotion under subsection (a), but has denied the request of 
    the officer for a delay of promotion and the officer then declines 
    to accept an appointment to a higher grade.
        ``(3) The Secretary concerned has approved the request of an 
    officer for a delay of promotion and, upon the end of the period of 
    delay authorized in accordance with regulations prescribed under 
    subsection (a), the officer then declines to accept an appointment 
    to a higher grade.

``Sec. 14313. Authority to vacate promotions to grade of brigadier 
            general or rear admiral (lower half)

    ``(a) Authority.--The President may vacate the appointment of a 
reserve officer to the grade of brigadier general or rear admiral 
(lower half) if the period of time during which the officer has served 
in that grade after promotion to that grade is less than 18 months.
    ``(b) Effect of Promotion Being Vacated.--Except as provided in 
subsection (c), an officer whose promotion to the grade of brigadier 
general is vacated under this section holds the grade of colonel as a 
reserve of the armed force of which the officer is a member. An officer 
whose promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half) is vacated 
under this section holds the grade of captain in the Naval Reserve. 
Upon assuming the lower grade, the officer shall have the same position 
on the reserve active-status list as the officer would have had if the 
officer had not served in the higher grade.
    ``(c) Special Rule for Officers Serving as Adjutant General.--In 
the case of an officer serving as an adjutant general or assistant 
adjutant general whose promotion to the grade of brigadier general is 
vacated under this section, the officer then holds the reserve grade 
held by that officer immediately before the officer's appointment as 
adjutant general or assistant adjutant general.

            ceasing to occupy positions commensurate with grade; State

the Army or the Air Force on the reserve active-status list in a 
general officer grade ceases to occupy a position commensurate with 
that grade (or commensurate with a higher grade), the Secretary 
concerned shall transfer or discharge the officer in accordance with 
whichever of the following the officer elects:
        ``(1) Transfer the officer in grade to the Retired Reserve, if 
    the officer is qualified and applies for the transfer.
        ``(2) Transfer the officer in grade to the inactive status list 
    of the Standby Reserve, if the officer is qualified.

    officer grade.

    appointment.
    ``(b) Adjutants General.--If a reserve officer who is federally 
recognized in the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard solely

adjutant general of a State ceases to occupy that position, the 
Secretary concerned, not later than 30 days after the date on which the 
officer ceases to occupy that position, shall--

    ``(c) Credit for Service in Grade.--An officer who is appointed 
under subsection (a)(3) or (b)(2)(B) shall be credited with an amount 
of service in the grade in which appointed that is equal to the amount

shall apply uniformly among the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine 
Corps, to authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned 
to limit the amount of prior commissioned service with which a person 
receiving an original appointment may be credited under paragraph (1), 
or to deny any such credit, in the case of a person who at the time of 
such appointment is credited with constructive service under subsection 
(b).
    ``(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, 
a person who is receiving an original appointment as a reserve 
commissioned officer (other than a commissioned warrant officer) of the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or a designation in, or an 
assignment to, an officer category in which advanced education or 
training is required and who has advanced education or training, shall 
be credited with constructive service for such education, training, or 
experience, as follows:
        ``(A) One year for each year of advanced education beyond the 
    baccalaureate degree level, for persons appointed or designated in, 
    or assigned to, officer categories requiring such advanced 
    education or an advanced degree as a prerequisite for such 
    appointment, designation, or assignment. In determining the number 
    of years of constructive service to be credited under this 
    subparagraph to officers in any professional field, the Secretary 
    concerned shall credit an officer with, but with not more than, the 
    number of years of advanced education required by a majority of 
    institutions that award degrees in that professional field for 
    completion of the advanced education or award of the advanced 
    degree.
        ``(B)(i) Credit for any period of advanced education in a 
    health profession (other than medicine and dentistry) beyond the 
    baccalaureate degree level which exceeds the basic education 
    criteria for such appointment, designation, or assignment, if such 
    advanced education will be directly used by the armed force 
    concerned.
        ``(ii) Credit for experience in a health profession (other than 
    medicine or dentistry), if such experience will be directly used by 
    the armed force concerned.

    internship or equivalent graduate medical, dental, or other formal 
    health professional training required by the armed forces, and (ii) 
    not more than one year for each additional year of such graduate-
    level training or experience creditable toward certification in a 
    speciality required by the armed force concerned.
        ``(D) Additional credit, in unusual cases, based on special 
    experience in a particular field.
        ``(E) Additional credit for experience as a physician or 
    dentist, if appointed, assigned, or designated as a medical or 
    dental officer.
    ``(2) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of 
medical or dental officers serving in an active status in a reserve 
component of the Army, Navy, or Air Force in grades below major or 
lieutenant commander is critically below the number needed by such 
reserve component in such grades, the Secretary of Defense may 
authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned to credit 
any person who is receiving an original appointment for service as a 
medical or dental officer with a period of constructive credit in such 
amount (in addition to any amount credited such person under subsection 
(b)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain 
or, in the case of the Naval Reserve, lieutenant.
    ``(3) Except as authorized by the Secretary concerned in individual 
cases and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in 
the case of a medical or dental officer, the amount of constructive 
service credited an officer under this subsection may not exceed the 
amount required in order for the officer to be eligible for an original 
appointment as a reserve officer of the Army, Air Force, or Marine 
Corps in the grade of major or as a reserve officer of the Navy in the 
grade of lieutenant commander.
    ``(4) Constructive service credited an officer under this 
subsection is in addition to any service credited that officer under 
subsection (a) and shall be credited at the time of the original 
appointment of the officer or assignment to or designation in an 
officer category in which advanced education or training or special 
experience is required.
    ``(c) Constructive service may not be credited under subsection (b) 
for education, training, or experience obtained while serving as a 
commissioned officer (other than a warrant officer) on active duty or 
in an active status. However, in the case of an officer who completes 
advanced education or receives an advanced degree while on active duty 
or in an active status and in less than the number of years normally 
required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced 
degree, constructive service may, subject to regulations prescribed 
under subsection (a)(2), be credited to the officer under subsection 
(b)(1)(A) to the extent that the number of years normally required to 
complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree 
exceeds the actual number of years in which such advanced education or 
degree is obtained by the officer.
    ``(d) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of 
qualified judge advocates serving on the active-duty list of the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in grades below lieutenant commander 
or major is critically below the number needed by that armed force in 
those grades, the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of 
the military department concerned to credit any person who is receiving 
an original appointment with a view to assignment to the Judge Advocate 
General's Corps of the Army or appointment to the Judge Advocate 
General's Corps of the Navy, or who is receiving an original 
appointment in the Air Force or Marine Corps with a view to designation 
as a judge advocate, with a period of constructive service in such an 
amount (in addition to any amount credited such person under subsection 
(b)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain 
or, in the case of the Navy, lieutenant, and the date of rank of such 
person being junior to that of all other officers of the same grade 
serving on the active-duty list.
    ``(e) Constructive service credited an officer under subsection (b) 
or (d) shall be used only for determining the officer's--
        ``(1) initial grade as a reserve officer;
        ``(2) rank in grade; and
        ``(3) service in grade for promotion eligibility.
    ``(f) The grade and position on the reserve active-status list of a 
person receiving an appointment as a reserve officer who at the time of 
appointment is credited with service under this section shall be 
determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense 
based upon the amount of service credited.''.

satisfactory service in the grade in which serving at the time of such 
transfer or discharge, notwithstanding failure of the person to

military family housing functions of the Department of the Army in the 
total amount of $1,736,686,000 as follows:

    design under section 2807 of title 10, United States Code, 
    $66,126,000.

            (A) For construction and acquisition, planning and design, 
        and improvements of military family housing and facilities,

            (B) For support of military family housing (including the 
        functions described in section 2833 of title 10, United States 
        Code), $1,013,708,000, of which not more than $243,442,000 may 
        be obligated or expended for the leasing of military family 
        housing worldwide.
    (b) Limitation on Total Cost of Construction Projects.--
Notwithstanding the cost variations authorized by section 2853 of title 
10, United States Code, and any other cost variation authorized by law, 
the total cost of all projects carried out under section 2101 of this 
Act may not exceed--
        (1) the total amount authorized to be appropriated under 
    paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) (as reduced by operation 
    of subsection (c)); and
        (2) $14,000,000 (the balance of the amount authorized under

pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a) is the sum of 
the amounts authorized to be appropriated in such paragraphs, reduced 
by $23,500,000, which represents the combination of project savings 
resulting from favorable bids, reduced overhead costs, cancellations

resulting from favorable bids, reduced overhead costs, cancellations 
due to force structure changes, and cancellations due to 1995 base 
closure and realignment decisions.

    ``(a) Limited Partnerships.--(1) In order to meet the housing 
requirements of members of the naval service, and the dependents of 
such members, at a military installation described in paragraph (2), 
the Secretary of the Navy may enter into a limited partnership with one 
or more private developers to encourage the construction of housing and 
accessory structures within commuting distance of the installation. The 
Secretary may contribute not less than five percent, but not more than 
35 percent, of the development costs under a limited partnership.
    ``(2) Paragraph (1) applies to a military installation under the 
jurisdiction of the Secretary at which there is a shortage of suitable 
housing to meet the requirements of members and dependents referred to 
in such paragraph.
    ``(b) Collateral Incentive Agreements.--The Secretary may also 
enter into collateral incentive agreements with private developers who 
enter into a limited partnership under subsection (a) to ensure that, 
where appropriate--
        ``(1) a suitable preference will be afforded members of the 
    naval service in the lease or purchase, as the case may be, of a 
    reasonable number of the housing units covered by the limited 
    partnership; or
        ``(2) the rental rates or sale prices, as the case may be, for 
    some or all of such units will be affordable for such members.
    ``(c) Selection of Investment Opportunities.--(1) The Secretary 
shall use publicly advertised, competitively bid or competitively 
negotiated, contracting procedures, as provided in chapter 137 of this 
title, to enter into limited partnerships under subsection (a).
    ``(2) When a decision is made to enter into a limited partnership 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit a report in writing to 
the appropriate committees of Congress on that decision. Each such 
report shall include the justification for the limited partnership, the 
terms and conditions of the limited partnership, a description of the 
development costs for projects under the limited partnership, and a 
description of the share of such costs to be incurred by the Secretary. 
The Secretary may then enter into the limited partnership only after 
the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the report is 
received by such committees.
    ``(d) Account.--(1) There is hereby established on the books of the 
Treasury an account to be known as the `Navy Housing Investment 
Account'.
    ``(2) There shall be deposited into the Account--
        ``(A) such funds as may be authorized for and appropriated to 
    the Account; and
        ``(B) any proceeds received by the Secretary from the repayment 
    of investments or profits on investments of the Secretary under 
    subsection (a).
    ``(3) In such amounts as is provided in advance in appropriation 
Acts, the Account shall be available for contracts, investments, and 
expenses necessary for the implementation of this section.
    ``(4) The Secretary may not enter into a contract in connection 
with a limited partnership under subsection (a) or a collateral 
incentive agreement under subsection (b) unless the Account contains 
sufficient funds, as of the time the contract is entered into, to 
satisfy the total obligations to be incurred by the United States under 
the contract.
    ``(e) Navy Housing Investment Board.--(1) The Secretary of the Navy 
shall establish a board to be known as the `Navy Housing Investment 
Board', which shall have the duties--
        ``(A) of advising the Secretary regarding those proposed 
    limited partnerships under subsection (a), if any, that are 
    financially and otherwise sound investments for meeting the 
    objectives of this section;
        ``(B) of administering the Account established under subsection 
    (d); and
        ``(C) of assisting the Secretary in such other ways as the 
    Secretary determines to be necessary and appropriate to carry out 
    this section.
    ``(2) The Navy Housing Investment Board shall be composed of seven 
members appointed for a two-year term by the Secretary. Among such 
members, the Secretary may appoint two persons from the private sector 
who have knowledge and experience in the financing and the construction 
of housing. The Secretary shall designate one of the members as 
chairperson of the Board.
    ``(3) Members of the Navy Housing Investment Board, other than 
those members regularly employed by the Federal Government, may be paid 
while attending meetings of the Board or otherwise serving at the 
request of the Secretary, compensation at a rate equal to the daily 
equivalent of the minimum annual rate of basic pay payable for level IV 
of the Executive Schedule under section 5315 of title 5 for each day 
(including travel time) during which the member is engaged in the 
actual performance of duties vested in the Board. Members shall receive 
travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in 
accordance with section 5702 and 5703 of title 5.
    ``(4) The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not 
apply to the Navy Housing Investment Board.
    ``(f) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal 
year in which the Secretary carries out activities under this section, 
the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report specifying the amount 
and nature of the deposits into, and the expenditures from, the Account 
during such fiscal year and of the amount and nature of all other 
expenditures made pursuant to such section during such fiscal year.
    ``(g) Transfer of Navy Lands Prohibited.--Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to permit the Secretary, as part of a limited 
partnership entered into under this section, to transfer the right,

        (4) a contract for construction of the project can be awarded 
    in that fiscal year.

criteria, the Senate should obtain the views of the Secretary of 
Defense. These views should include whether funds for a military 
construction project not included in the budget request can be offset 
by funds for other programs, projects, or activities, including 
military construction projects, in the budget request and, if so, the 
specific offsetting reductions recommended by the Secretary of Defense.

structure established jointly by the Federal Government and the States 
and their political subdivisions for emergency preparedness purposes 
can be effectively utilized to provide relief and assistance to people 
in areas of the United States struck by a hazard. The Federal 
Government shall provide necessary direction, coordination, and 
guidance, and shall provide necessary assistance, as authorized in this 
title so that a comprehensive emergency preparedness system exists for 
all hazards.
