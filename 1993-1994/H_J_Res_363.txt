                            Joint Resolution

  
 
  To designate October 1994 as ``Crime Prevention Month''.

Whereas crime prevention improves the quality of life in every 
  community;
Whereas crime prevention is a cost-effective answer to the problems 
  caused by crime, drug abuse, and fear of crime;
Whereas crime prevention is central to a sound criminal justice system 
  at National, State, and local levels;
Whereas millions of citizens have demonstrated that by working 
  together, they can reduce crime, drug abuse, and fear of crime;
Whereas all people of the United States, from preschoolers to senior 
  citizens, can help themselves, their families, and their 
  neighborhoods prevent crime and build safer more caring communities;
Whereas all kinds of community organizations (including individuals, 
  law enforcement, other State and local agencies, civic and community 
  groups, religious institutions, schools, and businesses) have vital 
  roles to play in reducing crime and building safer, more vibrant 
  communities;
Whereas it is important to honor annually those throughout society who 
  work to prevent crime and to build and sustain communities; and
Whereas the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign (featuring 
  McGruff the Crime Dog and sponsored by the Department of Justice, the 
  Crime Prevention Coalition, and the National Crime Prevention 
  Council) encourages effective partnerships to reduce crime and to 
  improve life throughout the Nation: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the month of October 1994 
is designated as ``Crime Prevention Month'' and the President is 
authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people 
of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.
