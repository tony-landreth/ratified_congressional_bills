                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

                            Joint Resolution


 
       To designate the months of October 1993 and October 1994 as

                        ``Country Music Month''.

Whereas country music derives its roots from the folk songs of our 
  Nation's workers, captures the spirit of our religions hymns, reflects 
  the sorrow and joy of our traditional ballads, and echoes the drive 
  and soulfulness of rhythm and blues;
Whereas country music has played an integral part in our Nation's 
  history, accompanying the growth of our Nation and reflecting the 
  ethnic and cultural diversity of our people;
Whereas country music embodies a spirit of the American people and the 
  deep and genuine feelings individuals experience throughout life;
Whereas the distinctively American refrains of country music have been 
  performed for audiences throughout the world, striking a chord deep 
  within the hearts and souls of fans everywhere; and
Whereas October 1993 and October 1994 mark, respectively, the twenty-
  ninth and thirtieth annual observances of Country Music Month: Now, 
  therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the months of October 1993 
and October 1994 are designated as ``Country Music Month'', and that the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe such months with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

                                                President of the Senate.
