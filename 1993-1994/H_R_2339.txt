SEC. 3. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND POLICY.

    (a) Section Heading.--Section 2 (29 U.S.C. 2201) is amended by 
striking the heading and inserting the following:

``SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND POLICY.''.

    (b) Findings.--Section 2(a) (29 U.S.C. 2201(a)) is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
        ``(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and 
    in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--
            ``(A) live independently;
            ``(B) enjoy self-determination;
            ``(C) make choices;
            ``(D) pursue meaningful careers; and
            ``(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, 
        political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of 
        American society.
        ``(2) During the past decade, there have been major advances in 
    modern technology. Technology is now a powerful force in the lives 
    of all residents of the United States. Technology can provide 
    important tools for making the performance of tasks quicker and 
    easier.
        ``(3) For some individuals with disabilities, assistive 
    technology devices and assistive technology services are necessary 
    to enable the individuals--
            ``(A) to have greater control over their lives;
            ``(B) to participate in, and contribute more fully to, 
        activities in their home, school, and work environments, and in 
        their communities;
            ``(C) to interact to a greater extent with individuals who 
        do not have disabilities; and
            ``(D) to otherwise benefit from opportunities that are taken 
        for granted by individuals who do not have disabilities.
        ``(4) Substantial progress has been made in the development of 
    assistive technology devices, including adaptations to existing 
    equipment, that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities 
    of all ages. Such devices can be used to increase the involvement of 
    such individuals in, and reduce expenditures associated with, 
    programs and activities such as early intervention, education, 
    rehabilitation and training, employment, residential living, 
    independent living, recreation, and other aspects of daily living.
        ``(5) Most States have technology-related assistance programs 
    carried out under this Act. In spite of the efforts made by such 
    programs, there remains a need to support systems change and 
    advocacy activities in order to assist States to develop and 
    implement consumer-responsive, comprehensive statewide programs of 
    technology-related assistance for individuals with disabilities of 
    all ages.
        ``(6) Notwithstanding the efforts of such State technology-
    related assistance programs, there is still a lack of--
            ``(A) resources to pay for assistive technology devices and 
        assistive technology services;
            ``(B) trained personnel to assist individuals with 
        disabilities to use such devices and services;
            ``(C) information among individuals with disabilities and 
        their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized 
        representatives, individuals who work for public agencies, or 
        for private entities (including insurers), that have contact 
        with individuals with disabilities, educators and related 
        service personnel, technology experts (including engineers), 
        employers, and other appropriate individuals about the 
        availability and potential of technology for individuals with 
        disabilities;
            ``(D) aggressive outreach to underrepresented populations 
        and rural populations;
            ``(E) systems that ensure timely acquisition and delivery of 
        assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, 
        particularly with respect to children;
            ``(F) coordination among State human services programs, and 
        between such programs and private entities, particularly with 
        respect to transitions between such programs and entities; and
            ``(G) capacity in such programs to provide the necessary 
        technology-related assistance.
        ``(7) Many individuals with disabilities cannot access existing 
    telecommunications and information technologies and are at risk of 
    not being able to access developing technologies. The failure of 
    Federal and State governments, hardware manufacturers, software 
    designers, information systems managers, and telecommunications 
    service providers to account for the specific needs of individuals 
    with disabilities results in the exclusion of such individuals from 
    the use of telecommunications and information technologies and 
    results in unnecessary costs associated with the retrofitting of 
    devices and product systems.
        ``(8) There are insufficient incentives for the commercial 
    pursuit of the application of technology devices to meet the needs 
    of individuals with disabilities, because of the perception that 
    such individuals constitute a limited market.
        ``(9) At the Federal level, there is a lack of coordination 
    among agencies that provide or pay for the provision of assistive 
    technology devices and assistive technology services. In addition, 
    the Federal Government does not provide adequate assistance and 
    information with respect to the use of assistive technology devices 
    and assistive technology services to individuals with disabilities 
    and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized 
    representatives, individuals who work for public agencies, or for 
    private entities (including insurers), that have contact with 
    individuals with disabilities, educators and related services 
    personnel, technology experts (including engineers), employers, and 
    other appropriate individuals.''.
    (c) Purposes.--Section 2(b) (29 U.S.C. 2201(b)) is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:

    systems change and advocacy activities designed to assist each State 
    in developing and implementing a consumer-responsive comprehensive 
    statewide program of technology-related assistance, for individuals 
    with disabilities of all ages, that is designed to--
            ``(A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, 
        and provision of, assistive technology devices and assistive 
        technology services;
            ``(B) increase the active involvement of individuals with

        implementation, and evaluation of such a program;
            ``(C) increase the involvement of individuals with 
        disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members,

        to enjoy the benefits of programs carried out to accomplish 
        purposes described in this paragraph to the same extent as other 
        populations;
            ``(E) increase and promote coordination among State 
        agencies, and between State agencies and private entities, that 
        are involved in carrying out activities under this title, 
        particularly providing assistive technology devices and

        impede the availability or provision of assistive technology 
        devices and assistive technology services;
            ``(G) increase the probability that individuals with 
        disabilities of all ages will, to the extent appropriate, be 
        able to secure and maintain possession of assistive technology 
        devices as such individuals make the transition between services 
        offered by human service agencies or between settings of daily 
        living;
            ``(H) enhance the skills and competencies of individuals 
        involved in providing assistive technology devices and assistive

            members, guardians, advocates, and authorized 
            representatives;
                ``(ii) individuals who work for public agencies, or for 
            private entities (including insurers), that have contact 
            with individuals with disabilities;
                ``(iii) educators and related services personnel;

        entities to provide and pay for assistive technology devices and 
        assistive technology services on a statewide basis for 
        individuals with disabilities of all ages; and
            ``(K) increase the awareness of the needs of individuals 
        with disabilities for assistive technology devices and for 
        assistive technology services.
        ``(2) To identify Federal policies that facilitate payment for 
    assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, to 
    identify Federal policies that impede such payment, and to eliminate 
    inappropriate barriers to such payment.
