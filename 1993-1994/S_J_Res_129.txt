Whereas 15 active duty members and at least 10 veterans of the United 
  States Armed Forces and members of their families were among those who 
  lost their lives in this tragedy;
Whereas the terrorist bombing of Flight 103 was unquestionably an attack 
  on the United States;
Whereas a memorial cairn honoring the victims of the bombing of Flight 
  103 has been donated to the people of the United States by the people 
  of Scotland;
Whereas a small, vacant plot of land, unsuitable for gravesites, has 
  been located in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia; and
Whereas Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia, is a fitting 
  and appropriate place for a memorial in honor of those who perished in 
  the Flight 103 bombing: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is 
authorized and requested to place in Arlington National Cemetery, 
Arlington, Virginia, a memorial cairn, donated by the people of 
Scotland, honoring the 270 victims of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 who died on December 21, 1988, over Lockerbie, Scotland.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
