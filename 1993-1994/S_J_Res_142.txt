        S.J.Res. 142
                       One Hundred Third Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday,
  the fifth day of January, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three


                            Joint Resolution


 
 Designating the week beginning November 7, 1993, and the week beginning

 November 6, 1994, each as ``National Women Veterans Recognition Week''.

Whereas there are more than 1,200,000 women veterans in the United 
  States representing 4.6 percent of the total veteran population;
Whereas the number of women serving in the United States Armed Forces 
  and the number of women veterans continue to increase;
Whereas women veterans have contributed greatly to the security of the 
  United States through honorable military service, often involving 
  great hardship and danger;
Whereas the special needs of women veterans, especially in the area of 
  health care, have often been overlooked or inadequately addressed by 
  the Federal Government;
Whereas the lack of attention to the special needs of women veterans has 
  discouraged or prevented many women veterans from taking full 
  advantage of the benefits and services to which they are entitled; and
Whereas designating a week to recognize women veterans will help both to 
  promote important gains made by women veterans and to focus attention 
  on the special needs of women veterans: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That the weeks beginning 
November 7, 1993, and November 6, 1994, respectively, are each 
designated as ``National Women Veterans Recognition Week'', and the 
President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe that week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.







                                Speaker of the House of Representatives.







                             Vice President of the United States and    
                                                President of the Senate.
