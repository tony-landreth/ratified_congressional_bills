SEC. 3. <<NOTE: 28 USC 994 note.>> REVIEW BY THE UNITED STATES 
                    SENTENCING COMMISSION.

    (a) In General.--Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of 
title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission 
shall review and, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing 
guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of 
offenses relating to the transmission or attempted transmission of a 
stolen trade secret outside of the United States or economic espionage, 
in order to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such 
offenses under the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements 
appropriately, reflect the seriousness of these offenses, account for 
the potential and actual harm caused by these offenses, and provide 
adequate deterrence against such offenses.
    (b) Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the United States 
Sentencing Commission shall--
            (1) consider the extent to which the Federal sentencing 
        guidelines and policy statements appropriately account for the 
        simple misappropriation of a trade secret, including the 
        sufficiency of the existing enhancement for these offenses to 
        address the seriousness of this conduct;

[[Page 126 STAT. 2443]]

            (2) consider whether additional enhancements in the Federal 
        sentencing guidelines and policy statements are appropriate to 
        account for--
                    (A) the transmission or attempted transmission of a 
                stolen trade secret outside of the United States; and
                    (B) the transmission or attempted transmission of a 
                stolen trade secret outside of the United States that is 
                committed or attempted to be committed for the benefit 
                of a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or 
                foreign agent;
            (3) ensure the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy 
        statements reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the 
        need to deter such conduct;
            (4) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant 
        directives, Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements, 
        and related Federal statutes;
            (5) make any necessary conforming changes to the Federal 
        sentencing guidelines and policy statements; and
            (6) ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines adequately 
        meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 
        3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.

    (c) Consultation.--In carrying out the review required under this 
section, the Commission shall consult with individuals or groups 
representing law enforcement, owners of trade secrets, victims of 
economic espionage offenses, the United States Department of Justice, 
the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States 
Department of State and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative.
    (d) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Review.--Not later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall complete its 
consideration and review under this section.
