            (2) On August 2, 1951, the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, 
        representing all Chippewa bands in Minnesota except the Red Lake

        Commission in Docket No. 188 for an accounting of the 
        Government's obligation to each of the member bands of the 
        Minnesota Chippewa Tribe under various statutes and treaties 
        that are not covered by the Nelson Act of January 14, 1889.
            (3) On May 17, 1999, a Joint Motion for Findings in Aid of

            (6) Pursuant to the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or 
        Distribution Act (25 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), Congress must act to
