        under subsection (a) includes a class or kind of merchandise 
        imported, or sold (or likely to be sold) for importation, into

        measure subsidies provided by the government of the nonmarket 
        economy country or a public entity within the territory of the

[[Page 126 STAT. 266]]

    ``(f) Adjustment of Antidumping Duty in Certain Proceedings Relating 
to Imports From Nonmarket Economy Countries.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the administering authority 
        determines, with respect to a class or kind of merchandise from 
        a nonmarket economy country for which an antidumping duty is 
        determined using normal value pursuant to section 773(c), that--
                    ``(A) pursuant to section 701(a)(1), a 
                countervailable subsidy (other than an export subsidy 
                referred to in section 772(c)(1)(C)) has been provided 
                with respect to the class or kind of merchandise,
                    ``(B) such countervailable subsidy has been 
                demonstrated to have reduced the average price of 
                imports of the class or kind of merchandise during the 
                relevant period, and
                    ``(C) the administering authority can reasonably 
                estimate the extent to which the countervailable subsidy 
                referred to in subparagraph (B), in combination with the 
                use of normal value determined pursuant to section 
                773(c), has increased the weighted average dumping 
                margin for the class or kind of merchandise,
        the administering authority shall, except as provided in 
        paragraph (2), reduce the antidumping duty by the amount of the 
        increase in the weighted average dumping margin estimated by the 
        administering authority under subparagraph (C).
            ``(2) Maximum reduction in antidumping duty.--The 
        administering authority may not reduce the antidumping duty 
        applicable to a class or kind of merchandise from a nonmarket 
        economy country under this subsection by more than the portion 
        of the countervailing duty rate attributable to a 
        countervailable subsidy that is provided with respect to the 
        class or kind of merchandise and that meets the conditions 
        described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph 
        (1).''.
