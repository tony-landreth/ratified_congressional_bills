as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed 
invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a 
whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the

petition to institute a derivation proceeding in the Office. The 
petition shall set forth with particularity the basis for finding that 
an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed 
invention from an inventor named in the petitioner's application and, 
without authorization, the earlier application claiming such invention 
was filed. <<NOTE: Time period.>> Any such petition may be filed only 
within the 1-year period beginning on the date of the first publication 
of a claim to an invention that is the same or substantially the same as 
the earlier application's claim to the invention, shall be made under 
oath, and shall be supported by substantial evidence. Whenever the 
Director determines that a petition filed under this subsection 
demonstrates that the standards for instituting a derivation proceeding 
are met, the Director may institute a derivation proceeding. The 
determination by the Director whether to institute a derivation 
proceeding shall be final and nonappealable.

    ``(b) Determination by Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--In a 
derivation proceeding instituted under subsection (a), the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board shall determine whether an inventor named in the 
earlier application derived the claimed invention from an inventor named 
in the petitioner's application and, without authorization, the earlier 
application claiming such invention was filed. In appropriate 
circumstances, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board may correct the naming 
of the inventor in any application or patent at 
issue. <<NOTE: Regulations.>> The Director shall prescribe regulations 
setting forth standards for the conduct of derivation proceedings, 
including requiring parties to provide sufficient evidence to prove and 
rebut a claim of derivation.

    ``(c) Deferral of Decision.--The <<NOTE: Time period.>> Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board may defer action on a petition for a derivation 
proceeding until the expiration of the 3-month period beginning on the 
date on which the Director issues a patent that includes the claimed 
invention that is the subject of the petition. The Patent Trial and 
Appeal Board also may defer action on a petition for a derivation 
proceeding, or stay the proceeding after it has been instituted, until 
the termination of a proceeding under chapter 30, 31, or 32 involving 
the patent of the earlier applicant.

    ``(d) Effect of Final Decision.--The final decision of the Patent 
Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in an application for 
patent, shall constitute the final refusal by the Office on those 
claims. The final decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal

[[Page 125 STAT. 290]]

Board, if adverse to claims in a patent, shall, if no appeal or other 
review of the decision has been or can be taken or had, constitute 
cancellation of those claims, and notice of such cancellation shall be 
endorsed on copies of the patent distributed after such cancellation.
    ``(e) Settlement.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under 
subsection (a) may terminate the proceeding by filing a written 
statement reflecting the agreement of the parties as to the correct 
inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. Unless the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board finds the agreement to be inconsistent with the 
evidence of record, if any, it shall take action consistent with the 
agreement. Any written settlement or understanding of the parties shall 
be filed with the Director. <<NOTE: Confidentiality.>> At the request of 
a party to the proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be 
treated as business confidential information, shall be kept separate 
from the file of the involved patents or applications, and shall be made 
available only to Government agencies on written request, or to any 
person on a showing of good cause.

    ``(f) Arbitration.--Parties <<NOTE: Regulations.>> to a proceeding 
instituted under subsection (a) may, within such time as may be 
specified by the Director by regulation, determine such contest or any 
aspect thereof by arbitration. Such arbitration shall be governed by the 
provisions of title 9, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with 
this section. <<NOTE: Notice.>> The parties shall give notice of any 
arbitration award to the Director, and such award shall, as between the 
parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it 
relates. The arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice 
is given. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from 
determining the patentability of the claimed inventions involved in the 
proceeding.''.

                examining--
                          (i) how the change would affect the ability of

                      change would create any advantages for applicants 
                      for patents that are small business concerns 
                      relative to applicants for patents that are not 
                      small business concerns;

                      small business concerns of alternative means of 
                      determining whether an applicant is entitled to a

                patent law.
                    (F) An analysis of whether the change to a first-to-
                file patent system creates a particular need for prior 
                user rights.

        contained at any time--
                    (A) a claim to a claimed invention that has an 
                effective filing date as defined in section 100(i) of 
                title 35, United States Code, that is on or after the 
                effective date described in this paragraph; or
                    (B) a specific reference under section 120, 121, or 
                365(c) of title 35, United States Code, to any patent or 
                application that contains or contained at any time such 
                a claim.
            (2) Interfering patents.--The provisions of sections 102(g), 
        135, and 291 of title 35, United States Code, as in effect on

                a claim.

    (o) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
converting the United States patent system from ``first to invent'' to a 
system of ``first inventor to file'' will promote the progress of 
science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors 
the exclusive rights to their discoveries and provide inventors with 
greater certainty regarding the scope of protection provided by the 
grant of exclusive rights to their discoveries.
    (p) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
converting the United States patent system from ``first to invent'' to a 
system of ``first inventor to file'' will improve the United States 
patent system and promote harmonization of the United States patent 
system with the patent systems commonly used in nearly all other 
countries throughout the world with whom the United States conducts 
trade and thereby promote greater international uniformity and certainty 
in the procedures used for securing the exclusive rights of inventors to 
their discoveries.

                    (A) In general.--The amendments made by subsection 
                (a) shall take effect upon the expiration of the 1-year 
                period beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
                Act and shall apply to any patent issued before, on, or 
                after that effective date.
                    (B) Graduated implementation.--The Director may

                that may be instituted under chapter 31 of title 35,

``Sec. 321. Post-grant review

    ``(a) In General.--Subject to the provisions of this chapter, a 
person who is not the owner of a patent may file with the Office a 
petition to institute a post-grant review of the patent. 
The <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Director shall establish, by regulation, fees 
to be paid by the person requesting the review, in such amounts as the 
Director determines to be reasonable, considering the aggregate costs of 
the post-grant review.

    ``(b) Scope.--A petitioner in a post-grant review may request to 
cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of a patent on any ground that 
could be raised under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 282(b) (relating 
to invalidity of the patent or any claim).
    ``(c) Filing Deadline.--A petition for a post-grant review may only 
be filed not later than the date that is 9 months after the date of the 
grant of the patent or of the issuance of a reissue patent (as the case 
may be).
``Sec. 322. Petitions

    ``(a) Requirements of Petition.--A petition filed under section 321 
may be considered only if--
            ``(1) the petition is accompanied by payment of the fee 
        established by the Director under section 321;
            ``(2) the petition identifies all real parties in interest;
            ``(3) the petition identifies, in writing and with 
        particularity, each claim challenged, the grounds on which the 
        challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that supports 
        the grounds for the challenge to each claim, including--
                    ``(A) copies of patents and printed publications 
                that the petitioner relies upon in support of the 
                petition; and
                    ``(B) affidavits or declarations of supporting 
                evidence and opinions, if the petitioner relies on other 
                factual evidence or on expert opinions;
            ``(4) the petition provides such other information as the 
        Director may require by regulation; and
            ``(5) the petitioner provides copies of any of the documents 
        required under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) to the patent owner 
        or, if applicable, the designated representative of the patent 
        owner.

    ``(b) Public Availability.--As soon as practicable after the receipt 
of a petition under section 321, the Director shall make the petition 
available to the public.
``Sec. 323. Preliminary response to petition

    ``If a post-grant review petition is filed under section 321, the 
patent owner shall have the right to file a preliminary response to the 
petition, within a time period set by the Director, that sets forth 
reasons why no post-grant review should be instituted based upon the 
failure of the petition to meet any requirement of this chapter.
``Sec. 324. Institution of post-grant review

    ``(a) Threshold.--The Director may not authorize a post-grant review 
to be instituted unless the Director determines that the information 
presented in the petition filed under section 321, if such information 
is not rebutted, would demonstrate that it is more likely than not that 
at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable.

[[Page 125 STAT. 307]]

    ``(b) Additional Grounds.--The determination required under 
subsection (a) may also be satisfied by a showing that the petition 
raises a novel or unsettled legal question that is important to other 
patents or patent applications.
    ``(c) Timing.--The Director shall determine whether to institute a 
post-grant review under this chapter pursuant to a petition filed under 
section 321 within 3 months after--
            ``(1) receiving a preliminary response to the petition under 
        section 323; or
            ``(2) if no such preliminary response is filed, the last 
        date on which such response may be filed.

    ``(d) Notice.--The Director shall notify the petitioner and patent 
owner, in writing, of the Director's determination under subsection (a) 
or (b), and shall make such notice available to the public as soon as is 
practicable. Such notice shall include the date on which the review 
shall commence.
    ``(e) No Appeal.--The determination by the Director whether to 
institute a post-grant review under this section shall be final and 
nonappealable.
``Sec. 325. Relation to other proceedings or actions

    ``(a) Infringer's Civil Action.--
            ``(1) Post-grant review barred by civil action.--A post-
        grant review may not be instituted under this chapter if, before 
        the date on which the petition for such a review is filed, the 
        petitioner or real party in interest filed a civil action 
        challenging the validity of a claim of the patent.
            ``(2) Stay of civil action.--If the petitioner or real party 
        in interest files a civil action challenging the validity of a 
        claim of the patent on or after the date on which the petitioner 
        files a petition for post-grant review of the patent, that civil 
        action shall be automatically stayed until either--
                    ``(A) the patent owner moves the court to lift the 
                stay;
                    ``(B) the patent owner files a civil action or 
                counterclaim alleging that the petitioner or real party 
                in interest has infringed the patent; or
                    ``(C) the petitioner or real party in interest moves 
                the court to dismiss the civil action.
            ``(3) Treatment of counterclaim.--A counterclaim challenging 
        the validity of a claim of a patent does not constitute a civil 
        action challenging the validity of a claim of a patent for 
        purposes of this subsection.

    ``(b) Preliminary Injunctions.--If a civil action alleging 
infringement of a patent is filed within 3 months after the date on 
which the patent is granted, the court may not stay its consideration of 
the patent owner's motion for a preliminary injunction against 
infringement of the patent on the basis that a petition for post-grant 
review has been filed under this chapter or that such a post-grant 
review has been instituted under this chapter.
    ``(c) Joinder.--If more than 1 petition for a post-grant review 
under this chapter is properly filed against the same patent and the 
Director determines that more than 1 of these petitions warrants the 
institution of a post-grant review under section 324, the Director may 
consolidate such reviews into a single post-grant review.
    ``(d) Multiple Proceedings.--Notwithstanding sections 135(a), 251, 
and 252, and chapter 30, during the pendency of any post-

[[Page 125 STAT. 308]]

grant review under this chapter, if another proceeding or matter 
involving the patent is before the Office, the Director may determine 
the manner in which the post-grant review or other proceeding or matter 
may proceed, including providing for the stay, transfer, consolidation, 
or termination of any such matter or proceeding. In determining whether 
to institute or order a proceeding under this chapter, chapter 30, or 
chapter 31, the Director may take into account whether, and reject the 
petition or request because, the same or substantially the same prior 
art or arguments previously were presented to the Office.
    ``(e) Estoppel.--
            ``(1) Proceedings before the office.--The petitioner in a 
        post-grant review of a claim in a patent under this chapter that 
        results in a final written decision under section 328(a), or the 
        real party in interest or privy of the petitioner, may not 
        request or maintain a proceeding before the Office with respect 
        to that claim on any ground that the petitioner raised or 
        reasonably could have raised during that post-grant review.
            ``(2) Civil actions and other proceedings.--The petitioner 
        in a post-grant review of a claim in a patent under this chapter 
        that results in a final written decision under section 328(a), 
        or the real party in interest or privy of the petitioner, may 
        not assert either in a civil action arising in whole or in part 
        under section 1338 of title 28 or in a proceeding before the 
        International Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff 
        Act of 1930 that the claim is invalid on any ground that the 
        petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during that 
        post-grant review.

    ``(f) Reissue Patents.--A post-grant review may not be instituted 
under this chapter if the petition requests cancellation of a claim in a 
reissue patent that is identical to or narrower than a claim in the 
original patent from which the reissue patent was issued, and the time 
limitations in section 321(c) would bar filing a petition for a post-
grant review for such original patent.
``Sec. 326. Conduct of post-grant review

    ``(a) Regulations.--The Director shall prescribe regulations--
            ``(1) providing that the file of any proceeding under this 
        chapter shall be made available to the public, except that any 
        petition or document filed with the intent that it be sealed 
        shall, if accompanied by a motion to seal, be treated as sealed 
        pending the outcome of the ruling on the motion;

        sufficient grounds to institute a review under subsections (a) 
        and (b) of section 324;

        supplemental information after the petition is filed;

        this chapter and the relationship of such review to other 
        proceedings under this title;

        of relevant evidence, including that such discovery shall be 
        limited to evidence directly related to factual assertions 
        advanced by either party in the proceeding;
            ``(6) prescribing sanctions for abuse of discovery, abuse of 
        process, or any other improper use of the proceeding, such

        as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or an unnecessary 
        increase in the cost of the proceeding;

        and submission of confidential information;

        response to the petition under section 323 after a post-grant 
        review has been instituted, and requiring that the patent owner

        additional factual evidence and expert opinions on which the 
        patent owner relies in support of the response;

        the patent owner to move to amend the patent under subsection 
        (d) to cancel a challenged claim or propose a reasonable number 
        of substitute claims, and ensuring that any information 
        submitted by the patent owner in support of any amendment 
        entered under subsection (d) is made available to the public as 
        part of the prosecution history of the patent;
            ``(10) providing either party with the right to an oral 
        hearing as part of the proceeding;
            ``(11) requiring that the final determination in any post-
        grant review be issued not later than 1 year after the date on 
        which the Director notices the institution of a proceeding under 
        this chapter, except that the Director may, for good cause 
        shown, extend the 1-year period by not more than 6 months, and 
        may adjust the time periods in this paragraph in the case of 
        joinder under section 325(c); and
            ``(12) providing the petitioner with at least 1 opportunity 
        to file written comments within a time period established by the 
        Director.

    ``(b) Considerations.--In prescribing regulations under this 
section, the Director shall consider the effect of any such regulation 
on the economy, the integrity of the patent system, the efficient 
administration of the Office, and the ability of the Office to timely 
complete proceedings instituted under this chapter.
    ``(c) Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--The Patent Trial and Appeal 
Board shall, in accordance with section 6, conduct each post-grant 
review instituted under this chapter.
    ``(d) Amendment of the Patent.--
            ``(1) In general.--During a post-grant review instituted 
        under this chapter, the patent owner may file 1 motion to amend 
        the patent in 1 or more of the following ways:
                    ``(A) Cancel any challenged patent claim.
                    ``(B) For each challenged claim, propose a 
                reasonable number of substitute claims.
            ``(2) Additional motions.--Additional motions to amend may 
        be permitted upon the joint request of the petitioner and the 
        patent owner to materially advance the settlement of a

        owner for good cause shown.
            ``(3) Scope of claims.--An amendment under this subsection 
        may not enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent or

``Sec. 327. Settlement

    ``(a) In General.--A post-grant review instituted under this chapter 
shall be terminated with respect to any petitioner upon the joint 
request of the petitioner and the patent owner, unless the Office has 
decided the merits of the proceeding before the request for termination 
is filed. If the post-grant review is terminated with respect to a 
petitioner under this section, no estoppel under section 325(e) shall 
attach to the petitioner, or to the real party in interest or privy of 
the petitioner, on the basis of that petitioner's institution of that 
post-grant review. If no petitioner remains in the post-grant review, 
the Office may terminate the post-grant review or proceed to a final 
written decision under section 328(a).
    ``(b) Agreements in Writing.--Any agreement or understanding between 
the patent owner and a petitioner, including any collateral agreements 
referred to in such agreement or understanding, made in connection with, 
or in contemplation of, the termination of a post-grant review under 
this section shall be in writing, and a true copy of such agreement or 
understanding shall be filed in the Office before the termination of the 
post-grant review as between the parties. <<NOTE: Confidentiality.>> At 
the request of a party to the proceeding, the agreement or understanding 
shall be treated as business confidential information, shall be kept 
separate from the file of the involved patents, and shall be made 
available only to Federal Government agencies on written request, or to 
any person on a showing of good cause.
``Sec. 328. Decision of the Board

    ``(a) Final Written Decision.--If a post-grant review is instituted 
and not dismissed under this chapter, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board 
shall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability 
of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner and any new claim added 
under section 326(d).
    ``(b) Certificate.--If the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issues a 
final written decision under subsection (a) and the time for appeal has 
expired or any appeal has terminated, the Director shall issue and 
publish a certificate canceling any claim of the patent finally 
determined to be unpatentable, confirming any claim of the patent 
determined to be patentable, and incorporating in the patent by 
operation of the certificate any new or amended claim determined to be 
patentable.
    ``(c) Intervening Rights.--Any proposed amended or new claim 
determined to be patentable and incorporated into a patent following a 
post-grant review under this chapter shall have the same effect as that 
specified in section 252 of this title for reissued patents on the right 
of any person who made, purchased, or used within the United States, or 
imported into the United States, anything patented by such proposed 
amended or new claim, or who made substantial preparation therefor, 
before the issuance of a certificate under subsection (b).

        Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding 3 times the median household 
        income for that preceding calendar year, as most recently

not considered to be named on a previously filed application for 
purposes of subsection (a)(2) if the applicant has assigned, or is under 
an obligation by contract or law to assign, all ownership rights in the 
application as the result of the applicant's previous employment.

[[Page 125 STAT. 319]]

this section, the Director may, in the Director's discretion, impose 
income limits, annual filing limits, or other limits on who may qualify 
as a micro entity pursuant to this section if the Director determines 
that such additional limits are reasonably necessary to avoid an undue 
impact on other patent applicants or owners or are otherwise reasonably 
necessary and appropriate. <<NOTE: Deadline. Notification.>> At least 3 
months before any limits proposed to be imposed pursuant to this 
subsection take effect, the Director shall inform the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the Senate of any such proposed limits.''.

        35, United States Code. All fees paid under this subsection

establish. <<NOTE: Deadline. Certificate.>> Within 3 months after the 
date a request for supplemental examination meeting the requirements of 
this section is received, the Director shall conduct the supplemental 
examination and shall conclude such examination by issuing a certificate

        considered, reconsidered, or corrected during a supplemental 
        examination of the patent. The making of a request under

section 102 or 103 of title 35, United States Code, any strategy for 
reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability, whether known or unknown 
at the time of the invention or application for patent, shall be deemed 
insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the prior art.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``tax 
liability'' refers to any liability for a tax under any Federal, State, 
or local law, or the law of any foreign jurisdiction, including any

        product, or system used solely for financial management, to the

        limit the use of any tax strategy by any taxpayer or tax 
        advisor.

construed to imply that other business methods are patentable or that

        that patent, the court shall decide whether to enter a stay 
        based on--
                    (A) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will 
                simplify the issues in question and streamline the 
                trial;
                    (B) whether discovery is complete and whether a 
                trial date has been set;
                    (C) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, would 
                unduly prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear 
                tactical advantage for the moving party; and
                    (D) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will 
                reduce the burden of litigation on the parties and on 
                the court.
            (2) Review.--A party may take an immediate interlocutory 
        appeal from a district court's decision under paragraph (1). The

        testing and diagnoses.
            (2) The effect that providing independent second opinion 
        genetic diagnostic testing would have on the existing patent and 
        license holders of an exclusive genetic test.
            (3) The impact that current exclusive licensing and patents 
        on genetic testing activity has on the practice of medicine,
