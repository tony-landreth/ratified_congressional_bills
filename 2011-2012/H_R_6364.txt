            (1) From 2014 through 2018, the United States and nations 
        around the world will mark the centennial of World War I, 
        including the entry of the United States into the war in April 
        1917.
            (2) America's support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and 
        its other allies in World War I marked the first time in United 
        States history that American soldiers went abroad in defense of 
        liberty against foreign aggression, and it marked the true 
        beginning of the ``American century''.
            (3) Although World War I was at the time called ``the war to 
        end all wars'', in fact the United States would commit its 
        troops to the defense of foreign lands 3 more times in the 20th 
        century.
            (4) More than 4,000,000 men and women from the United States 
        served in uniform during World War I, among them 2 future 
        presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two 
        million individuals from the United States served overseas 
        during World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel who served 
        on the seas. The United States suffered 375,000 casualties 
        during World War I, including 116,516 deaths.
            (5) The events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, the 
        United States, and the lives of millions of people.

[[Page 126 STAT. 2449]]

            (6) The centennial of World War I offers an opportunity for 
        people in the United States to learn about and commemorate the 
        sacrifices of their predecessors.
            (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow 
        people in the United States to learn about the history of World 
        War I, the United States involvement in that war, and the war's 
        effects on the remainder of the 20th century, and to commemorate
