SEC. 15. REVIEW AND REPORT ON DOMESTIC CONTENT POLICY.

    (a) In General.--The Export-Import Bank of the United States shall

term transactions. The review shall examine and evaluate the 
effectiveness of the Bank's policy--
            (1) in maintaining and creating jobs in the United States; 
        and
            (2) in contributing to a stronger national economy through 
        the export of goods and services.

    (b) Factors to Consider.--In conducting the review under subsection 
(a), the Bank shall consider the following:
            (1) Whether the domestic content policy accurately captures 
        the costs of United States production of goods and services, 
        including the direct and indirect costs of manufacturing costs, 
        parts, components, materials and supplies, research, planning 
        engineering, design, development, production, return on 
        investment, marketing and other business costs and the effect of 
        such policy on the maintenance and creation of jobs in the 
        United States.
            (2) The ability of the Bank to provide financing that is 
        competitive with the financing provided by foreign export credit 
        agencies and the impact that such financing has in enabling

[[Page 126 STAT. 359]]

        companies with operations in the United States to contribute to 
        a stronger United States economy by increasing employment 
        through the export of goods and services.
            (3) The effects of the domestic content policy on the 
        manufacturing and service workforce of the United States.
            (4) Any recommendations the members of the Bank's Advisory 
        Committee have regarding the Bank's domestic content policy.
            (5) The effect that changes to the Bank's domestic content 
        requirements would have in providing companies an incentive to 
        create and maintain operations in the United States and to 
        increase jobs in the United States.

    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Bank shall submit a report on the results of the review 
conducted under this section to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of

                      STATES.

conduct a study of the process and methodology used by the Export-Import 
Bank of the United States (in this section referred to as the ``Bank'')

the creation and maintenance of employment in the United States, 
determine and assess the basis on which the Bank has so used the 
methodology, and make any recommendations the Comptroller General deems

Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Congress and the Bank

General of the United States shall review the adequacy of the design and 
effectiveness of the controls used by the Export-Import Bank of the
