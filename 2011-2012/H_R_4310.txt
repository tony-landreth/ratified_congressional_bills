SEC. 129. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERING IN EARLY 
                        STAGES OF SHIPBUILDING.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) placing a priority on engineering dollars in the early 
        stages of shipbuilding programs is a vital component of keeping 
        cost down; and
            (2) therefore, the Secretary of the Navy should take 
        appropriate steps to prioritize early engineering in large ship 
        construction including amphibious class ships beginning with the 
        LHA-8.
SEC. 130. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC 
                        SUBMARINES.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the continuous at-sea deterrence provided by a robust 
        and modern fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines 
        is critical to maintaining nuclear deterrence and assurance and 
        therefore is a central pillar of the national security of the 
        United States;
            (2) the Navy should--
                    (A) carry out a program to replace the Ohio class 
                ballistic missile submarines;
                    (B) ensure that the first such replacement submarine 
                is delivered and fully operational by not later than 
                2031 in order to maintain continuous at-sea deterrence; 
                and
                    (C) develop a risk mitigation plan to ensure that 
                robust continuous at-sea deterrence is provided during 
                the transition from Ohio class ballistic missile 
                submarines to the replacement submarines; and
            (3) a minimum of 12 replacement ballistic missile submarines 
        are necessary to provide continuous at-sea deterrence over the 
        lifetime of such submarines and, therefore, the Navy should 
        carry out a program to produce 12 such submarines.
SEC. 131. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARINE CORPS AMPHIBIOUS LIFT AND 
                        PRESENCE REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Marine Corps is a combat force that leverages 
        maneuver from the sea as a force multiplier allowing for a 
        variety of operational tasks ranging from major combat 
        operations to humanitarian assistance.
            (2) The Marine Corps is unique in that, while embarked upon 
        naval vessels, they bring all the logistic support necessary for 
        the full range of military operations and, operating ``from the 
        sea'', they require no third-party host nation permission to 
        conduct military operations.
            (3) The Navy has a requirement for 38 amphibious assault 
        ships to meet this full range of military operations.
            (4) Due only to fiscal constraints, that requirement of 38 
        vessels was reduced to 33 vessels, which adds military risk to 
        future operations.
            (5) The Navy has been unable to meet even the minimal 
        requirement of 30 operationally available vessels and has 
        submitted a shipbuilding and ship retirement plan to Congress 
        that will reduce the force to 28 vessels.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1659]]

            (6) Experience has shown that early engineering and design 
        of naval vessels has significantly reduced the acquisition costs 
        and life-cycle costs of those vessels.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should carefully evaluate the 
        maritime force structure necessary to execute demand for forces 
        by the commanders of the combatant commands;
            (2) the Navy should carefully evaluate amphibious lift 
        capabilities to meet current and projected requirements;
            (3) the Navy should consider prioritization of investment in 
        and procurement of the next generation of amphibious assault 
        ships as a component of the balanced battle force;
            (4) the next generation amphibious assault ships should 
        maintain survivability protection;
            (5) operation and maintenance requirements analysis, as well 
        as the potential to leverage a common hull form design, should 
        be considered to reduce total ownership cost and acquisition 
        cost; and
            (6) maintaining a robust amphibious ship building industrial 
        base is vital for the future of the national security of the 
        United States.
SEC. 132. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY FISCAL 
                        YEAR 2014 BUDGET REQUEST FOR TACTICAL 
                        AVIATION AIRCRAFT.

    It is the sense of the Senate that, if the budget request of the 
Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-18 aircraft includes a 
request for funds for more than 13 new F-18 aircraft, the budget request 
of the Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-35 aircraft 
should include a request for funds for not fewer than six F-35B aircraft 
and four F-35C aircraft, presuming that development, testing, and 
production of the F-35 aircraft are proceeding according to current 
plans.

            (1) it is a national priority to defend the United States 
        homeland against the threat of limited ballistic missile attack 
        (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate);
            (2) the currently deployed ground-based midcourse defense 
        system, with 30 ground-based interceptors deployed in Alaska and 
        California, provides a level of protection of the United States 
        homeland;
            (3) it is essential for the ground-based midcourse defense 
        system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, 
        sustainability, and operational performance that will allow it 
        to continue providing protection of the United States homeland;
            (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest 
        priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 
        ground-based midcourse defense system flight test failure and 
        demonstrate the correction in flight tests before resuming 
        production of the capability enhancement-II kill vehicle, in 
        order to provide confidence that the system will work as 
        intended;
            (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance the 
        performance and reliability of the ground-based midcourse 
        defense system, and enhance the capability of the ballistic 
        missile defense system, to provide improved capability to defend 
        the homeland;
            (6) the Missile Defense Agency should have a robust, 
        rigorous, and operationally realistic testing program for the 
        ground-based midcourse defense system, including salvo testing, 
        multiple simultaneous engagement testing, and operational 
        testing;
            (7) the Department of Defense has taken a number of prudent, 
        affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant steps 
        to hedge against the possibility of future growth in the missile 
        threat to the homeland from North Korea and Iran; and

[[Page 126 STAT. 1680]]

            (8) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate 
        the evolving threat of limited ballistic missile attack, 
        particularly from countries such as North Korea and Iran, and 
        consider other possibilities for prudent, affordable, cost-
        effective, and operationally significant steps to improve the 
        posture of the United States to defend the homeland.

        is a response to the existing and growing ballistic missile 
        threat from Iran to forward deployed United States forces, 
        allies and partners in Europe;
            (6) the Department of Defense--
                    (A) should, as a high priority, continue to develop, 
                test, and plan to deploy all four phases of the European 
                Phased Adaptive Approach, including all variants of the 
                standard missile-3 interceptor;
                    (B) should continue to conduct tests to evaluate and 
                assess the capability of future phases of the European 
                Phased Adaptive Approach and to demonstrate whether they 
                will achieve their intended roles, as outlined in the 
                Ballistic Missile Defense Review of 2010; and
                    (C) should also continue with its other phased and 
                adaptive regional missile defense efforts tailored to 
                the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region; and
            (7) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization are making a variety of contributions to missile 
        defense in Europe, by hosting elements of missile defense 
        systems of the United States on their territories, through 
        individual national contributions to missile defense capability, 
        and by collective funding and development of the Active Layered 
        Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system; and
            (8) allies and partners of the United States in the Asia-
        Pacific region and in the Middle East are making contributions 
        to regional missile defense capabilities, including by hosting 
        elements of missile defense systems of the United States on 
        their territories; jointly developing missile defense 
        capabilities; and cooperating in regional missile defense

SEC. 232. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the Senate leadership, 
        President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) ``invited the Russian Federation to 
        cooperate on missile defense, which could lead to adding Russian 
        capabilities to those deployed by NATO to enhance our common 
        security against common threats. The Lisbon Summit thus 
        demonstrated that the Alliance's missile defenses can be 
        strengthened by improving NATO-Russian relations. This comes 
        even as we have made it clear that the system we intend to 
        pursue with Russia will not be a joint system, and it will not 
        in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense 
        capabilities.''.
            (2) In a February 2, 2011, message to the Senate concerning 
        its December 22, 2010, Resolution of Advice and Consent to 
        Ratification of the New START Treaty, President Obama certified 
        that ``It is the policy of the United States to continue 
        development and deployment of United States missile defense 
        systems to defend against missile threats from nations such as 
        North Korea and Iran, including qualitative and quantitative 
        improvements to such systems. As stated in the Resolution, such 
        systems include all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to 
        missile defense in Europe, the modernization of the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system, and the continued development of the 
        two-stage Ground-Based Interceptor as a technological and 
        strategic hedge.''.
            (3) In a letter dated December 13, 2011, to Senator Mark 
        Kirk, Robert Nabors, Assistant to the President and Director of 
        the Office of Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``The United 
        States remains committed to implementing the European Phased 
        Adaptive Approach to missile defense, and will not agree to any 
        constraints limiting the development or deployment of United 
        States missile defenses'' and ``[w]e will not provide Russia 
        with sensitive information about our missile defense systems 
        that would in any way compromise our national security. For 
        example, hit-to-kill technology and interceptor telemetry will 
        under no circumstances be provided to Russia.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) pursuant to section 2 of the National Missile Defense 
        Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 113 Stat. 205; 10 U.S.C. 2431 
        note), it is the policy of the United States ``to deploy as soon 
        as is technologically possible an effective National Missile 
        Defense system capable of defending the territory of

[[Page 126 STAT. 1685]]

        the United States against limited ballistic missile attack 
        (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate)...'';
            (2) defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for 
        new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should 
        deterrence fail;
            (3) further limitations on the missile defense capabilities 
        of the United States are not in the national security interest 
        of the United States;
            (4) the New Start Treaty and the April 7, 2010, unilateral 
        statement of the Russian Federation on missile defense do not 
        limit in any way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, 
        activities that the Federal Government of the United States 
        currently plans or that might be required over the duration of 
        the New START Treaty to protect the United States pursuant to 
        the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, or to protect the 
        Armed Forces of the United States and allies of the United 
        States from limited ballistic missile attack, including further 
        planned enhancements to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system and all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile 
        defense in Europe;
            (5) it was the Understanding of the Senate in its December 
        22, 2010, Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of 
        the New START Treaty that, ``any additional New START Treaty 
        limitations on the deployment of missile defenses beyond those 
        contained in paragraph 3 of Article V, including any limitations 
        agreed under the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative 
        Commission, would require an amendment to the New START Treaty 
        which may enter into force for the United States only with the 
        advice and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, 
        section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States''; 
        and
            (6) section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act 
        (22 U.S.C. 2573(b)) requires that ``no action shall be taken 
        pursuant to this or any other Act that would obligate the United 
        States to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the 
        United States in a militarily significant manner, except 
        pursuant to the treaty-making power of the President set forth 
        in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution.''.

    (c) New START Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``New START 
Treaty'' means the Treaty between the United States of America and the 
Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation 
of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into 
force on February 5, 2011.
SEC. 233. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF THE 
                        HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND 
                        STRATEGY REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF 
                        DEFENSE.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report 
        required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) is 
        necessary to inform Congress on options to protect the United 
        States homeland against the evolving ballistic missile threat, 
        including potential options prior to the deployment of Phase 4 
        of the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and

[[Page 126 STAT. 1686]]

            (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the 
        requirements of such section 233 by submitting the homeland 
        defense hedging policy and strategy report to Congress.

                    (C) products commercialized;
                    (D) small businesses trained;
                    (E) companies started; and

    (c) Collaboration.--The Secretary of Defense may meet, collaborate, 
and share resources with other Federal agencies for purposes of 
assisting in the use and appropriate growth of regional advanced 
technology clusters under this section.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
        means--
                    (A) the congressional defense committees;
                    (B) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
                Transportation of the Senate; and
                    (C) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the 
                House of Representatives.
            (2) The term ``regional advanced technology clusters'' means 
        geographic centers focused on building science and technology-
        based innovation capacity in areas of local and regional 
        strength to foster economic growth and improve quality of life.
SEC. 253. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INCREASING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS 
                        OF TRAINING EXERCISES FOR MEMBERS OF THE 
                        ARMED FORCES.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) modeling and simulation will continue to play a critical 
        role in the training of the members of the Armed Forces;
            (2) while increased modeling and simulation has reduced 
        overall costs of training of members of the Armed Forces,

[[Page 126 STAT. 1690]]

        there are still significant costs associated with the human 
        resources required to execute certain training exercises where 
        role-playing actors for certain characters such as opposing 
        forces, the civilian populace, other government agencies, and 
        non-governmental organizations are required;
            (3) technological advances in areas such as varying levels 
        of autonomy for systems, multi-player gaming techniques, and 
        artificial intelligence could reduce the number of personnel 
        required to support certain training exercises for members of 
        the Armed Forces, and thereby reduce the overall cost of the 
        exercises; and
            (4) the Secretary of Defense should develop a plan to 
        increase the use of emerging technologies in autonomous systems, 
        the commercial gaming sector, and artificial intelligence for 
        training exercises for members of the Armed Forces to increase 
        training effectiveness and reduce costs.

        the potential encroachment of a project significantly impairs or 
        degrades the capability of the Department to conduct missions or 
        maintain readiness to the extent of presenting an unacceptable 
        risk to national security with strong consideration given to the 
        input provided by the military services.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2003, the Department of Defense initiated the Item 
        Unique Identification (IUID) Initiative, which requires the 
        marking and tracking of assets deployed throughout the Armed 
        Forces or in the possession of Department contractors.
            (2) The Initiative has the potential for realizing 
        significant cost savings and improving the management of defense 
        equipment and supplies throughout their lifecycle.
            (3) The Initiative can help the Department combat the 
        growing problem of counterfeit parts in the military supply 
        chain.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) to support efforts by the Department of Defense to 
        implement the Item Unique Identification Initiative;
            (2) to support measures to verify contractor compliance with 
        section 252.211-7003 (entitled ``Item Identification and 
        Valuation'') of the Defense Supplement to the Federal 
        Acquisition Regulation, on Unique Identification, which states 
        that a unique identification equivalent recognized by the 
        Department is required for certain acquisitions;

[[Page 126 STAT. 1828]]

            (3) to encourage the Armed Forces to adopt and implement 
        Item Unique Identification actions and milestones; and
            (4) to support investment of sufficient resources and 
        continued training and leadership to enable the Department to 
        capture meaningful data and optimize the benefits of the Item 
        Unique Identification Initiative.

                    (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified 
                United States Cyber Command and a justification of the

                      could serve as a commander of a combatant command 
                      that conducts overt, though clandestine, cyber 
                      operations under title 10, United States Code, and 
                      serve as the head of an element of the 
                      intelligence community that conducts covert cyber

                      (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a manner that affords 
                      deniability to the United States; and
                          (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary 
                      believes it is appropriate either to appoint a 
                      line officer as the Director of the National 
                      Security Agency or to take the unprecedented step

                      commander; and
            (5) appropriate policy foundations and standing rules of

[[Page 126 STAT. 1897]]

            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that 
        the civilian personnel workforce and service contractor 
        workforce of the Department of Defense are appropriately sized 
        to support and execute the National Military Strategy, taking 
        into account military personnel and force structure 
        levels. <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Not later than 90 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense

        under the policies issued by the Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Personnel and Readiness for determining the most appropriate and 
        cost-efficient mix of military, civilian, and service contractor 
        personnel to perform the missions of the Department of Defense.

    (b) Savings.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall achieve 
savings in the total funding for each workforce covered by such plan 
over the period from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 that are

for basic military personnel pay achieved from reductions in military 
end strengths over the same period of time.
    (c) Exclusions.--In developing and implementing the plan required by 
subsection (a) and achieving the savings percentages required by 
subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may exclude expenses related to 
the performance of functions identified as core or critical to the

                    (A) Personnel in Mission Critical Occupations, as 
                defined by the Civilian Human Capital Strategic Plan of 
                the Department of Defense and the Acquisition Workforce

        such other critical functions as may be identified by the 
        Secretary as requiring exemption in the interest of the national 
        defense.

    (d) Reports.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 120 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense

[[Page 126 STAT. 1898]]

        shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report 
        including a comprehensive description of the plan required by 
        subsection (a).
            (2) Status reports.--As part of the budget submitted by the 
        President to Congress for each of fiscal years 2015 through 
        2018, the Secretary shall include a report describing the 
        implementation of the plan during the prior fiscal year and any 
        modifications to the plan required due to changing 
        circumstances. Each such report shall include a summary of the 
        savings achieved in such prior fiscal year through reductions in 
        the military, civilian, and service contractor personnel 
        workforces, and the number of military, civilian, and service 
        contractor personnel reduced. In any case in which savings fall 
        short of the annual target, the report shall include an 
        explanation of the reasons for such shortfall.
            (3) Exclusions.--Each report under paragraphs (1) and (2)

preclude the Secretary from exercising authority available to the 
Department under sections 129a, 2330a, 2461, and 2463 of title 10, 
United States Code.

equal to 30 percent of the amount of the reductions in appropriated 
funds attributable to reduced budgets for the civilian and service 
contractor workforces of the Department by reason of the plan required 
by subsection (a) should be made available for costs of assisting 
military personnel separated from the Armed Forces in the transition 
from military service.
    (g) Service Contractor Workforce Defined.--In this section, the term 
``service contractor workforce'' means contractor employees performing 
contract services, as defined in section 2330(c)(2) of title 10, United 
States Code, other than contract services that are funded out of amounts 
available for overseas contingency operations.
    (h) Comptroller General Review and Report.--For each fiscal year 
from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018, the Comptroller General 
of the United States shall review the status reports submitted by the 
Secretary as required by subsection (d)(2) to determine whether the

SEC. 1017. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECAPITALIZATION FOR THE NAVY AND 
                          COAST GUARD.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) More than 70 percent of the world's surface is comprised 
        of navigable oceans.
            (2) More than 80 percent of the population of the world 
        lives within 100 miles of an ocean.
            (3) More than 90 percent of the world's commerce traverses 
        an ocean.
            (4) The national security of the United States is 
        inextricably linked to the maintenance of global freedom of 
        access for both the strategic and commercial interests of the 
        United States.
            (5) To maintain that freedom of access the sea services of 
        the United States, composed of the Navy, the Marine Corps, and 
        the Coast Guard, must be sufficiently positioned as rotationally 
        globally deployable forces with the capability to decisively 
        defend United States citizens, homeland, and interests abroad 
        from direct or asymmetric attack and must

[[Page 126 STAT. 1910]]

        be comprised of sufficient vessels to maintain global freedom of 
        action.
            (6) To achieve appropriate capabilities to ensure national 
        security, the Government of the United States must continue to 
        recapitalize the fleets of the Navy and Coast Guard and must 
        continue to conduct vital maintenance and repair of existing 
        vessels to ensure such vessels meet service life goals.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the sea services of the United States should be funded 
        and maintained to provide the broad spectrum of capabilities 
        required to protect the national security of the United States;
            (2) such capabilities should include--
                    (A) the ability to project United States power 
                rapidly anywhere on the globe without the need for host 
                nation basing permission or long and potentially 
                vulnerable logistics supply lines;
                    (B) the ability to land and recover maritime forces 
                from the sea for direct combat action, to evacuate 
                United States citizens from hostile situations, and to 
                provide humanitarian assistance where needed;
                    (C) the ability to operate from the subsurface with 
                overpowering conventional combat power, as well as 
                strategic deterrence; and
                    (D) the ability to operate in collaboration with 
                United States maritime partners in the common interest 
                of preventing piracy at sea and maintaining the 
                commercial sea lanes available for global commerce;
            (3) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of the Navy, should maintain the recapitalization 
        plans for the Navy as a priority in all future force structure 
        decisions; and
            (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security should maintain the 
        recapitalization plans for the Coast Guard as a priority in all 
        future force structure decisions.
SEC. 1018. NOTICE TO CONGRESS FOR THE REVIEW OF PROPOSALS TO NAME 
                          NAVAL VESSELS.

    (a) <<NOTE: 10 USC 7292 note.>>  Findings.--Congress makes the 
following findings:
            (1) The Navy traces its ancestry to October 13, 1775, when 
        an Act of the Continental Congress authorized the first vessel 
        of a navy for the United Colonies. Vessels of the Continental 
        Navy were named for early patriots and military heroes, Federal 
        institutions, colonial cities, and positive character traits 
        representative of naval and military virtues.
            (2) An Act of Congress on March 3, 1819, made the Secretary 
        of the Navy responsible for assigning names to vessels of the 
        Navy. Traditional sources for vessel names customarily 
        encompassed such categories as geographic locations in the 
        United States; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and 
        military heroes and leaders; and noted individuals who made 
        distinguished contributions to United States national security.
            (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and 
        necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.

    (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

[[Page 126 STAT. 1911]]

    ``(d)(1) <<NOTE: Time period. Reports.>> The Secretary of the Navy 
may not announce or implement any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy 
until 30 days after the date on which the Secretary submits to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives a report setting forth such proposal.

    ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the 
justification for the proposal covered by such report in accordance with 
the standards referred to in section 1024(a) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.''.
    (c) <<NOTE: 10 USC 7292 note.>> Effective Date.--This section and

                regard to the individual to be transferred; and

SEC. 1037. NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPON REDUCTIONS AND EXTENDED 
                          DETERRENCE POLICY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should pursue negotiations with the 
        Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed 
        and nondeployed nonstrategic nuclear forces;
            (2) nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be considered when 
        weighing the balance of the nuclear forces of the United States 
        and the Russian Federation;
            (3) any geographical relocation or storage of nonstrategic 
        nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation does not constitute a 
        reduction or elimination of such weapons;
            (4) the vast advantage of the Russian Federation in 
        nonstrategic nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to the United 
        States and its allies and a growing asymmetry in Western Europe;
            (5) the forward-deployed nuclear forces of the United States 
        are an important contributor to the assurance of the allies of 
        the United States and constitute a check on proliferation and a 
        tool in dealing with neighboring states hostile to the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (``NATO'');

[[Page 126 STAT. 1926]]

            (6) the United States should maintain its commitment to 
        extended deterrence, specifically the nuclear alliance of NATO, 
        as an important component of ensuring and linking the national 
        security interests of the United States and the security of its 
        European allies;
            (7) forward-deployed nuclear forces of the United States 
        shall remain based in Europe in support of the nuclear policy 
        and posture of NATO subject to the policy and requirements of 
        NATO;
            (8) the presence of nuclear weapons of the United States in 
        Europe--combined with NATO's unique nuclear sharing arrangements 
        under which non-nuclear members participate in nuclear planning 
        and possess specially configured aircraft capable of delivering 
        nuclear weapons--provides reassurance to allies and partners who 
        feel exposed to regional threats; and
            (9) only the President and Congress have the legal authority 
        over the nuclear forces of the United States and no multilateral 
        organization, not even NATO, can articulate a declaratory policy 
        concerning the use of nuclear weapons that binds the United 
        States.

    (b) Notification.--

SEC. 1077. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECOGNIZING AIR MOBILITY COMMAND 
                          ON ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On June 1, 1992, Air Mobility Command was established as 
        the Air Force's functional command for cargo and passenger 
        delivery, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation.
            (2) As the lead Major Command for all Mobility Air Forces, 
        Air Mobility Command ensures that the Air Force's core functions 
        of global vigilance, power, and reach are fulfilled.
            (3) The ability of the United States to rapidly respond to 
        humanitarian disasters and the outbreak of hostilities anywhere 
        in the world truly defines the United States as a global power.
            (4) Mobility Air Forces Airmen are unified by one single 
        purpose: to answer the call of others so they may prevail.
            (5) The United States' hand of friendship to the world many 
        times takes the form of Mobility Air Forces aircraft delivering 
        humanitarian relief. Since its inception, Air Mobility Command 
        has provided forces for 43 humanitarian relief efforts at home 
        and abroad, from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Bam, Iran.
            (6) A Mobility Air Forces aircraft departs every 2 minutes, 
        365 days a year. Since September 11, 2001, Mobility Air Forces 
        aircraft have flown 18.9 million passengers, 6.8 million tons of 
        cargo, and offloaded 2.2 billion pounds of fuel. Many of these 
        flights have assisted combat aircraft protection United States 
        forces from overhead.
            (7) The United States keeps its solemn promise to its men 
        and women in uniform with Air Mobility Command, accomplishing 
        186,940 patient movements since the beginning of Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom.
            (8) Mobility Air Forces Airmen reflect the best values of 
        the Nation: delivering hope, saving lives, and fueling the 
        fight.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, on the 
occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Air Mobility 
Command, the people of the United States should--
            (1) recognize the critical role that Mobility Air Forces 
        play in the Nation's defense; and
            (2) express appreciation for the leadership of Air Mobility 
        Command and the more than 134,000 active-duty, Air National

        Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Department of Defense civilians 
        that make up the command.

SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States mobile communications industry is a 
        significant economic engine;
            (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing new 
        and more efficient technologies and techniques to maximize their 
        existing spectrum capacity, there is a pressing need for 
        additional spectrum for mobile broadband services;

[[Page 126 STAT. 1964]]

            (3) as the United States faces the growing demand for 
        spectrum, consideration should be given to both the supply of 
        spectrum for licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;
            (4) while such growing demand can be met in part by 
        reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, the 
        long-term solution must include reallocation and sharing of 
        Federal Government spectrum for private sector use;
            (5) recognizing the important uses of spectrum by the 
        Federal Government, including for national security, law 
        enforcement, and other critical Federal uses, existing law 
        ensures that Federal operations are not harmed as a result of a 
        reallocation of spectrum for commercial use, including through 
        the establishment of the Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse 
        Federal users for the costs of planning and implementing 
        relocation and sharing arrangements and, with respect to 
        spectrum vacated by the Department of Defense, certification 
        under section 1062(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65; 113 Stat. 768) by the 
        Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the 
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement spectrum 
        provides comparable technical characteristics to restore 
        essential military capability; and
            (6) given the need to determine equitable outcomes for the 
        United States in relation to spectrum use that balance the 
        demand of the private sector for spectrum with national security 
        and other critical Federal missions, all interested parties 
        should be encouraged to continue the collaborative efforts 
        between industry and government stakeholders that have been 
        launched by the National Telecommunications and Information 
        Administration to assess and recommend practical frameworks for 
        the development of relocation, transition, and sharing 
        arrangement and plans for 110 megahertz of Federal spectrum in 
        the 1695-1710 MHz and the 1755-1850 MHz bands.

        agency in which the employee performed such service, and these 
        performance evaluations shall be provided the same weight in the 
        receipt of promotions and other rewards by the employee from the

        national security or homeland security that requires integration

        agencies to ensure that the executive branch of the Government 
        operates as a single, cohesive enterprise to maximize mission 
        success and minimize cost.

        National Security Forces personnel and Afghan Public Protection 
        Force personnel;
            (3) the Department of Defense and the Government of

        Security Assistance Force and the Government of Afghanistan 
        should establish a program to continue to enhance vetting of 
        Afghanistan National Security Forces and Afghan Public 
        Protection Force recruits, to monitor the Afghanistan National 
        Security Forces and the Afghan Public Protection Force 
        personnel, and to re-assess Afghanistan National Security Forces

SEC. 1224. SENSE OF CONGRESS COMMENDING THE ENDURING STRATEGIC 
                          PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED 
                          STATES AND AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and Afghanistan have been allies in 
        the conflict against al Qaeda and its affiliates for over a 
        decade, with the shared goal of ensuring that Afghanistan is 
        never again a sanctuary for al Qaeda.
            (2) The United States and Afghanistan are committed to the 
        framework agreed to at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO) Summit in Lisbon in 2010, and reaffirmed at the NATO 
        Summit in Chicago in 2012, for the transition from coalition 
        forces to the Afghan National Security Forces of lead 
        responsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by the end of 
        2014.
            (3) In June 2011, President Barack Obama said, ``What we can 
        do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people 
        that endures--one that ensures that we will be able to continue 
        targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan 
        government''.
            (4) In November 2011, a traditional loya jirga in Kabul 
        declared that ``strategic cooperation with the United States of 
        America, which is a strategic ally of the people and government 
        of Afghanistan, is considered important in order to ensure 
        political, economic, and military security'' and also stated, 
        ``Signing a strategic cooperation document with the United 
        States conforms with the national interest of Afghanistan and is 
        of significant importance''.
            (5) On May 2, 2012, President Obama and President Hamid 
        Karzai signed the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement 
        Between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of 
        Afghanistan.
            (6) At the signing of the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement, President Obama said, ``Today we're agreeing to be 
        long-term partners in combating terrorism, and training Afghan 
        security forces, strengthening democratic institutions and 
        supporting development, and protecting human rights of all 
        Afghans. With this agreement, the Afghan people, and the world, 
        should know that Afghanistan has a friend and a partner in the 
        United States''.
            (7) At a May 20, 2012, bilateral meeting with President 
        Karzai at the NATO Summit in Chicago, President Obama said that 
        the Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement ``reflects a future 
        in which two sovereign nations--the United States and 
        Afghanistan--are operating as partners, to the benefit of our 
        countries' citizens, but also for the benefit of peace and 
        security and stability in the region and around the world''.
            (8) President Karzai said at the May 20, 2012, bilateral 
        meeting with President Obama, ``Mr. President, the partnership 
        that we signed a few weeks ago in Kabul has turned a new page in 
        our relations. And the new page is a page of two sovereign 
        countries working together for the mutual interests--peace and 
        security and in all other areas''.
            (9) On May 26, 2012, the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of 
        the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of 191-7 
        with 2 abstentions.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1998]]

            (10) On June 3, 2012, the Meshrano Jirga, the upper house of 
        the Afghan parliament, approved the Agreement by a vote of 67-
        13.
            (11) On July 8, 2012, at the Tokyo Conference on 
        Afghanistan, the international community and the Government of 
        Afghanistan reaffirmed their partnership in the economic growth 
        and development of Afghanistan through a process of mutual 
        commitments and accountability.
            (12) On July 4, 2012, the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement entered into force.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the members of the United States Armed Forces, 
        intelligence community, and diplomatic and development community 
        of the United States are to be commended for their dedicated 
        efforts and sacrifices in support of military and stability 
        operations in Afghanistan that have helped strengthen security 
        in Afghanistan, laid the foundation for transition to a long-
        term partnership between the United States and a sovereign 
        Afghanistan, and supported the Government and people of 
        Afghanistan as they continue to build their capacity to 
        effectively and justly govern;
            (2) the United States negotiating team for the Enduring 
        Strategic Partnership Agreement, including the United States 
        Embassy personnel in Kabul under the leadership of Ambassador 
        Ryan Crocker, is to be commended for its committed diplomatic 
        efforts;
            (3) the Governments of the United States and Afghanistan are 
        to be commended for concluding the Enduring Strategic 
        Partnership Agreement;
            (4) Congress supports the objectives and principles of the 
        Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement, including protecting 
        and promoting shared democratic values, advancing long-term 
        security, reinforcing regional security and cooperation, 
        fostering social and economic development, upholding the rights 
        of women and minorities, and strengthening institutions and 
        governance in Afghanistan;
            (5) it is essential that the Government and people of 
        Afghanistan fulfill Afghanistan's international commitments as 
        agreed at the Tokyo Conference of July 2012, the Bonn Conference 
        of December 2011, the Kabul Conference of July 2011, and other 
        venues to combat corruption, protect the equal rights of all 
        citizens of Afghanistan and enforce the rule of law, hold free 
        and fair elections in 2014, and build inclusive and effective 
        institutions of democratic governance;
            (6) a key national security interest of the United States is 
        to maintain a long-term political, economic, and military 
        relationship with Afghanistan, including a limited presence of 
        United States Armed Forces for the purpose of training, 
        advising, and supporting Afghan National Security Forces and 
        cooperating on shared counterterrorism objectives;
            (7) the negotiation and conclusion of a Bilateral Security 
        Agreement, as called for in the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement, will provide a fundamental framework for the long-
        term security relationship between the United States and 
        Afghanistan; and

[[Page 126 STAT. 1999]]

            (8) Congress has a critical role in continuing to provide 
        the support and assistance necessary to achieve the goals of the 
        Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement.

        to--
                    (A) undertake all appropriate activities to 
                accomplish the President's stated goal of transitioning 
                the lead responsibility for security to the Government 
                of Afghanistan by mid-summer 2013;
                    (B) as part of accomplishing this transition of the 
                lead responsibility for security to the Government of

                States troops by not later than December 31, 2014, and 
                take all possible steps to end such operations at the 
                earliest date consistent with a safe and orderly draw 
                down of United States troops in Afghanistan; and
            (2) the recommendations of the commanders of the 
        International Security Assistance Force on the overall strategy

        given serious consideration.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

SEC. 1281. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SALE OF AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8) codified the 
        basis for commercial, cultural, and other relations between the 
        people of the United States and the people of Taiwan;
            (2) the Taiwan Relations Act states that ``the United States 
        will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense 
        services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan 
        to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability'', and that 
        ``both the President and the Congress shall determine the nature 
        and quantity of such defense articles and services based solely 
        upon their judgment on the needs of Taiwan, in accordance with 
        procedures established by law'';

        Relations Act, should continue to make available to Taiwan such

        maintain a sufficient self-defense capability;
            (4) notwithstanding the upgrade of Taiwan's F-16 A/B 
        aircraft, Taiwan will experience a growing shortfall in fighter 
        aircraft, particularly as its F-5 aircraft are retired from 
        service; and
            (5) the President should take steps to address Taiwan's 
        shortfall in fighter aircraft, whether through the sale of F-16 
        C/D aircraft or other aircraft of similar capability, as may be 
        necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense 
        capability.

                          ISLANDS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the East China Sea is a vital part of the maritime 
        commons of Asia, including critical sea lanes of communication 
        and commerce that benefit all nations of the Asia-Pacific 
        region;

[[Page 126 STAT. 2040]]

            (2) the peaceful settlement of territorial and 
        jurisdictional disputes in the East China Sea requires the 
        exercise of self-restraint by all parties in the conduct of 
        activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and 
        destabilize the region, and differences should be handled in a 
        constructive manner consistent with universally recognized 
        principles of customary international law;
            (3) while the United States takes no position on the 
        ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands, the United States 
        acknowledges the administration of Japan over the Senkaku 
        Islands;
            (4) the unilateral action of a third party will not affect 
        the United States' acknowledgment of the administration of Japan 
        over the Senkaku Islands;
            (5) the United States has national interests in freedom of 
        navigation, the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for 
        international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce;
            (6) the United States supports a collaborative diplomatic 
        process by claimants to resolve territorial disputes without 
        coercion, and opposes efforts at coercion, the threat of use of 
        force, or use of force by any claimant in seeking to resolve 
        sovereignty and territorial issues in the East China Sea; and
            (7) the United States reaffirms its commitment to the 
        Government of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual 
        Cooperation and Security that ``[e]ach Party recognizes that an 
        armed attack against either Party in the territories under the 
        administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and 
        safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger 
        in accordance with its constitutional provisions and 
        processes''.

            (1) the industrial composition of companies receiving 
        subcontracts pursuant to the test program for the negotiation of 
        comprehensive small business subcontracting plans pursuant to 
        section 834 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal

        consolidates, or otherwise groups requirements into contracts 
        that are unsuitable for award to small business concerns, the 
        extent to which such bundling, consolidation, or grouping of 
        requirements is justified, and the effects that such practices 
        have on small business participation in contracting 
        opportunities with the Department;
            (6) the degree to which abuses of small business contracting 
        and subcontracting programs result in contracts and subcontracts 
        intended for small business concerns not being awarded to small 
        business concerns; and
            (7) an examination of the transition challenges faced by 
        businesses that graduate from small business programs or grow to 
        exceed the size standards for participation in such programs,

                authority pursuant to paragraph (2), insure that the

                goal established by the President pursuant to this 
                paragraph.''.

    (b) Amendments to the Small Business Act.--Paragraph (2) of section 
15(g) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (A), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``Such goals shall separately address prime contract awards and 
        subcontract awards for each category of small business 
        covered.'';
            (2) <<NOTE: Plans.>>  in subparagraph (D), by striking ``For 
        the purpose of establishing goals under this subsection'' and 
        all that follows through the end of that subparagraph, and 
        inserting the following: ``After establishing goals under this 
        paragraph for a fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency 
        shall develop a plan for achieving such goals at both the prime 
        contract and the subcontract level, which shall apportion 
        responsibilities among the agency's acquisition executives and 
        officials. In establishing goals under this paragraph, the head 
        of each Federal agency shall make a consistent effort to 
        annually expand participation by small business concerns from 
        each industry category in procurement contracts and subcontracts 
        of such agency, including participation by small business 
        concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, 
        qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business 
        concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and

            (3) by striking subparagraphs (E) and (F) and inserting the 
        following:
                    ``(E) The head of each Federal agency, in attempting 
                to attain expanded participation under subparagraph (D), 
                shall consider--
                          ``(i) contracts awarded as the result of 
                      unrestricted competition; and
                          ``(ii) contracts awarded after competition 
                      restricted to eligible small business concerns 
                      under this section and under the program 
                      established under section 8(a).
                    ``(F)(i) Each procurement employee or program 
                manager described in clause (ii) shall communicate to 
                the subordinates of the procurement employee or program 
                manager the importance of achieving goals established 
                under subparagraph (A).
                    ``(ii) A procurement employee or program manager

                having contracting authority.''.

    (c) <<NOTE: Deadline. Review. Revision. 15 USC 644 note.>>  
Additional Requirements.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this part, the Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration shall review and revise the Goaling Guidelines for the 
Small Business Preference Programs for Prime and Subcontract Federal 
Procurement Goals and Achievements to the extent necessary to ensure 
that--
            (1) agency subcontracting goals are established on the basis 
        of realistically achievable improvements to levels of 
        subcontracting rather than on the basis of an average of 
        previous years' subcontracting performance;
            (2) agency contracting and subcontracting goals are 
        established in a manner that does not exclude categories of 
        contracts on the basis of--
                    (A) the type of goods or services for which the 
                agency contracts;
                    (B) in the case of contracts subject to competitive 
                procedures under chapter 33 of title 41, United States 
                Code--
                          (i) whether or not funding for the contracts 
                      is made directly available to the agency by an 
                      Appropriations Act or is made available by 
                      reimbursement from another agency or account; or
                          (ii) whether or not the contract is subject to 
                      the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and
            (3) whenever an agency contracting or subcontracting goal is 
        established at a level lower than the Governmentwide goal for 
        small business concerns or the relevant category of small 
        business concerns, the Administration is required to document 
        the basis for the decision to establish such lower goal.

    (d) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Assessment Required.--Not later than 60 
days after the date of the enactment of this part, the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration shall enter into a 
contract with an appropriate entity to conduct an independent assessment 
of the small business procurement goals established in section 15(g) of 
the Small Business Act.
            (1) Coordination with department of defense.--To the extent 
        practicable, the Administrator shall coordinate this assessment 
        with the Secretary of Defense, to avoid unnecessary duplication 
        with the assessment required by section 1613 of this title.
            (2) Matters covered.--The assessment under this subsection 
        shall, at a minimum, include--
                    (A) a description of the industrial composition of 
                companies receiving prime contracts and subcontracts 
                with the Federal Government;

                domestic small business concerns, small business 
                concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled 
                veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, 
                small business concerns owned and controlled by socially

                business concerns owned and controlled by women;
                    (C) a comparison of the industrial composition of 
                prime contractors and subcontractors participating in 
                Federal contracting and the industrial composition of 
                domestic small

                more than one Federal agency to track such data;
                    (E) recommendations for improving the quality and

        Protection

[[Page 126 STAT. 2095]]

        Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)), as amended by section 1702, 
        including a report from a contracting officer representative, an

        other credible source, the contracting or grant officer shall 
        promptly refer the matter to the agency's Office of Inspector 
        General for investigation. The contracting officer may also 
        direct the contractor to take specific steps to abate an alleged 
        violation or enforce the requirements of a compliance plan 
        implemented pursuant to section 1703.
            (2) <<NOTE: Review. Determination.>>  Investigation.--An 
        Inspector General who receives a referral under paragraph (1) or

        of such a subgrantee or subcontractor, has engaged in an

        rationale for the decision not to investigate.
            (3) Criminal investigation.--If the matter is referred to 
        the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, the

        or cooperative agreement; any subgrantee or subcontractor of the 
        recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of a subgrantee or 
        subcontractor. If the <<NOTE: Determination.>> criminal 
        investigation results in a decision not to prosecute, the 
        Inspector General shall promptly determine whether to resume any 
        investigation that was suspended pursuant to this 
        paragraph. <<NOTE: Documentation.>> In the event that an 
        Inspector General does not resume an investigation, the 
        Inspector General shall document the rationale for the decision.

of a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any subcontractor or 
subgrantee of the recipient; or any agent of the recipient or of such a 
subcontractor or subgrantee, engaged in any of the activities described 
in section 106(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22

        of a subgrantee or subcontractor, engaged in any of the 
        activities described in section 106(g) of the Trafficking 
        Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)), as amended

        head of agency shall consider taking one or more of the 
        following remedial actions:
                    (A) Requiring the recipient to remove an employee 
                from the performance of work under the grant, contract, 
                or cooperative agreement.

                    (C) Suspending payments under the grant, contract, 
                or cooperative agreement until such time as the 
                recipient of the grant, contract, or cooperative 
                agreement has taken appropriate remedial action.
                    (D) Withholding award fees, consistent with the 
                award fee plan, for the performance period in which the

        executive agency may consider whether the contractor or grantee

        factor in determining which remedies, if any, should apply.
            (4) Aggravating factor.--Where applicable, the head of an 
        executive agency may consider the failure of a contractor or 
        grantee to abate an alleged violation or enforce the 
        requirements of a compliance plan when directed by a contracting 
        officer pursuant to subsection (a)(1) as an aggravating factor
