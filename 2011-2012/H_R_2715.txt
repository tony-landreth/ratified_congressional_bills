To provide the Consumer Product Safety Commission with greater authority 
 and discretion in enforcing the consumer product safety laws, and for 
         other purposes. <<NOTE: Aug. 12, 2011 -  [H.R. 2715]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON LEAD IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS.

    (a) Prospective Application of Lead Limit for Children's Products.--
Section 101(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 
(15 U.S.C. 1278a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Application.--Each limit set forth in paragraph (2) 
        (except for the limit set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B)) 
        shall apply only to a children's product (as defined in section 
        3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a))) 
        that is manufactured after the effective date of such respective 
        limit.''.

    (b) Alternative Limits and Exceptions.--Section 101(b) of such Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1278a(b)(1)) is amended--
            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:
            ``(1) Functional purpose exception.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The <<NOTE: Notice.>> Commission, 
                on its own initiative or upon petition by an interested 
                party, shall grant an exception to the limit in 
                subsection (a) for a specific product, class of product, 
                material, or component part if the Commission, after 
                notice and a hearing, determines that--

                      or component part requires the inclusion of lead

                      technologically feasible to manufacture such 
                      product, class of product, material, or component 
                      part, as the case may be, in accordance with 
                      subsection (a) by removing the excessive lead or 
                      by making the lead inaccessible;

                      material, or component part is not likely to be 
                      placed in the mouth or ingested, taking into 
                      account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and 
                      abuse of such product, class of product, material, 
                      or component part by a child; and

                      product, material, or component part will have no 
                      measurable adverse effect on public health or 
                      safety, taking into account normal and reasonably 
                      foreseeable use and abuse.

                    ``(B) Measurement.--For purposes of subparagraph 
                (A)(iii), there is no measurable adverse effect on 
                public health or safety if the exception described in 
                subparagraph (A) will result in no measurable increase 
                in blood lead levels of a child. The Commission may 
                adopt an alternative method of measurement other than 
                blood lead levels if it determines, after notice and a 
                hearing, that such alternative method is a better 
                scientific method for measuring adverse effect on public 
                health and safety.
                    ``(C) Procedures for granting exception.--
                          ``(i) Burden of proof.--A party seeking an 
                      exception under subparagraph (A) has the burden of 
                      demonstrating that it meets the requirements of 
                      such subparagraph.
                          ``(ii) Grounds for decision.--In the case 
                      where a party has petitioned for an exception, in 
                      determining whether to grant the exception, the 
                      Commission may base its decision solely on the 
                      materials presented by the party seeking the 
                      exception and any materials received through 
                      notice and a hearing.
                          ``(iii) Admissible evidence.--In demonstrating 
                      that it meets the requirements of subparagraph 
                      (A), a party seeking an exception under such 
                      subparagraph may rely on any nonproprietary 
                      information submitted by any other party seeking 
                      such an exception and such information shall be 
                      considered part of the record presented by the 
                      party that relies on that information.
                          ``(iv) Scope of exception.--If an exception is 
                      sought for an entire product, the burden is on the 
                      petitioning party to demonstrate that the criteria 
                      in subparagraph (A) are met with respect to every 
                      accessible component or accessible material of the

                cases, petitioners must notify the Commission of their
