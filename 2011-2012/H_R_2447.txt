SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On June 25, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued 
        Executive Order No. 8802 establishing the Fair Employment 
        Practices Commission and opening the doors for the very first 
        African-Americans to enlist in the United States Marine Corps.
            (2) The first Black Marine recruits were trained at Camp 
        Montford Point, near the New River in Jacksonville, North 
        Carolina.
            (3) On August 26, 1942, Howard P. Perry of Charlotte, North 
        Carolina, was the first Black private to set foot on Montford 
        Point.
            (4) During April 1943 the first African-American Marine 
        Drill Instructors took over as the senior Drill Instructors of 
        the eight platoons then in training; the 16th Platoon (Edgar R. 
        Huff), 17th (Thomas Brokaw), 18th (Charles E. Allen), 19th 
        (Gilbert H. Johnson), 20th (Arnold R. Bostic), 21st (Mortimer A. 
        Cox), 22nd (Edgar R. Davis, Jr.), and 23rd (George A. Jackson).
            (5) Black Marines of the 8th Ammunition Company and the 36th 
        Depot Company landed on the island of Iwo Jima on D-Day, 
        February 19, 1945.
            (6) The largest number of Black Marines to serve in combat 
        during World War II took part in the seizure of Okinawa in the 
        Ryuku Islands with some 2,000 Black Marines seeing action during 
        the campaign.
            (7) On November 10, 1945, the first African-American Marine, 
        Frederick C. Branch, was commissioned as a second lieutenant at 
        the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia.
            (8) Overall 19,168 Blacks served in the Marine Corps in 
        World War II.
            (9) An enterprising group of men, including original 
        Montford Pointer Master Sergeant Brooks E. Gray, planned a 
        reunion of the Men of Montford Point, and on September 15, 1965, 
        approximately 400 Montford Point Marines gathered at the Adelphi 
        Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to lay the foundation for 
        the Montford Point Marine Association Inc., 16 years after the 
        closure of Montford Point as a training facility for Black 
        recruits.

[[Page 125 STAT. 750]]

            (10) Organized as a non-military, nonprofit entity, the 
        Montford Point Marine Association's main mission is to preserve 
        the legacy of the first Black Marines.
            (11) Today the Montford Point Marine Association has 36 
        chapters throughout the United States.
            (12) Many of these first Black Marines stayed in the Marine 
        Corps like Sergeant Major Edgar R. Huff.
            (13) Sergeant Major Huff was one of the very first recruits 
        aboard Montford Point.
            (14) Sergeant Major Huff was also the first African-American 
        Sergeant Major and the first African-American Marine to retire 
        with 30 years of service which included combat in three major 
        wars, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.
            (15) During the Tet Offensive, Sergeant Major Huff was 
        awarded the Bronze Star Medal with combat ``V'' for valor for 
        saving the life of his radio operator.
            (16) Another original Montford Pointer who saw extensive 
        combat action in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War was 
        Sergeant Major Louis Roundtree.
            (17) Sergeant Major Roundtree was awarded the Silver Star 
        Medal, four Bronze Star Medals, three Purple Hearts, and 
        numerous other personal and unit awards for his service during 
        these conflicts.
            (18) On April 19, 1974, Montford Point was renamed Camp 
        Johnson after legendary Montford Pointer Sergeant Major Gilbert 
        ``Hashmark'' Johnson.
            (19) The Montford Point Marine Association has several 
        memorials in place to perpetuate the memory of the first 
        African-American Marines and their accomplishments, including--
                    (A) the Montford Point Marine Association Edgar R. 
                Huff Memorial Scholarship which is offered annually 
                through the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation;
                    (B) the Montford Point Museum located aboard Camp 
                Johnson (Montford Point) in Jacksonville, North 
                Carolina;
                    (C) the Brooks Elbert Gray, Jr. Consolidated 
                Academic Instruction Facility named in honor of original 
                Montford Pointer and the Montford Point Marine Corps 
                Association founder Master Gunnery Sergeant Gray. This 
                facility was dedicated on 15 April 2005 aboard Camp 
                Johnson, North Carolina; and
                    (D) during July of 1997 Branch Hall, a building 
                within the Officers Candidate School in Quantico, 
                Virginia, was named in honor of Captain Frederick
