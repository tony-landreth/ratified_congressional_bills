                or fungible material or by using an inventory management 
                method with respect to the fungible good or fungible

                classification set forth in Annex 4.1 of the Agreement.

        in calculating the regional value-content of the good.

    (i) Packaging Materials and Containers for Retail Sale.--Packaging 
materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale, if

all the nonoriginating materials used in the production of the good 
undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set forth in 
Annex 3-A or Annex 4.1 of the Agreement, and, if the good is subject to 
a regional value-content requirement, the value of such packaging

                paragraph (1) of section 330(d) of the Tariff Act of 
                1930 (19 U.S.C. 1330(d)(1)), may extend the effective 
                period of any import relief provided under this section 
                by up to 2 years, if the President determines that--
                          (i) the import relief continues to be 
                      necessary to remedy or prevent serious injury and

                      to import competition; and
                          (ii) there is evidence that the industry is

                      Commission shall conduct an investigation to 
                      determine whether action under this section 
                      continues to be necessary to remedy or prevent 
                      serious injury and whether there is evidence that 
                      the industry is making a positive adjustment to 
                      import competition.

                        RELIEF.

    (a) Determination.--
            (1) In general.--If a positive determination is made under 
        section 321(b), the President shall determine whether, as a 
        result of the elimination of a duty under the Agreement, a 
        Colombian textile or apparel article is being imported into the 
        United States in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or 
        relative to the domestic market for that article, and under such 
        conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, 
        to a domestic industry producing an article that is like, or 
        directly competitive with, the imported article.
            (2) Serious damage.--In making a determination under 
        paragraph (1), the President--
                    (A) shall examine the effect of increased imports on 
                the domestic industry, as reflected in changes in such 
                relevant economic factors as output, productivity, 
                utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, 
                exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and 
                losses, and investment, no one of which is necessarily 
                decisive; and
                    (B) shall not consider changes in consumer 
                preference or changes in technology in the United States 
                as factors supporting a determination of serious damage 
                or actual threat thereof.

    (b) Provision of Relief.--
            (1) In general.--If a determination under subsection (a) is 
        affirmative, the President may provide relief from imports of 
        the article that is the subject of such determination, as 
        provided in paragraph (2), to the extent that the President 
        determines necessary to remedy or prevent the serious damage and 
        to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry.
            (2) Nature of relief.--The relief that the President is 
        authorized to provide under this subsection with respect to 
        imports of an article is an increase in the rate of duty imposed 
        on the article to a level that does not exceed the lesser of--
                    (A) the column 1 general rate of duty imposed under 
                the HTS on like articles at the time the import relief 
                is provided; or

        extend the effective period of any import relief provided under 
        this subtitle for a period of not more than 1 year, if the 
        President determines that--
                    (A) the import relief continues to be necessary to 
                remedy or prevent serious damage and to facilitate 
                adjustment by the domestic industry to import 
                competition; and
                    (B) there is evidence that the industry is making a 
                positive adjustment to import competition.
