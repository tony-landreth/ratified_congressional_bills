                due to not disclosing such information;
            (3) notifying the Director of National Intelligence that 
        there is a significant supply chain risk to the covered system

SEC. 414. <<NOTE: 50 USC 403-4a note.>> CREATING AN OFFICIAL 
                        RECORD OF THE OSAMA BIN LADEN OPERATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed terrorist 
        leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a targeted strike 
        against his secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
            (2) Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist 
        organization, the most significant terrorism threat to the 
        United States and the international community.
            (3) Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks 
        which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, 2001, the 
        most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in which al 
        Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into 
        the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in 
        Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by civilian 
        passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near Shanksville, 
        Pennsylvania.
            (4) Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other 
        deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its 
        allies, including the 1998 bombings of United States embassies 
        in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in 
        Yemen, and against innocent civilians in countries around the 
        world, including the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, 
        Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in 
        London, England.
            (5) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the 
        United States, under President George W. Bush, led an 
        international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda, 
        deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned areas along 
        the Pakistani border, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.
            (6) President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional 
        forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan

[[Page 125 STAT. 1892]]

        as ``the central front in our enduring struggle against 
        terrorism and extremism''.
            (7) The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces 
        have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its 
        affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world.
            (8) The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence 
        community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, 
        Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous dedication, 
        sacrifice, and professionalism.
            (9) The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the 
        intelligence community prompted the Director of National 
        Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, ``Never have I 
        seen a more remarkable example of focused integration, seamless 
        collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence as was 
        demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the ultimate 
        demise of Osama bin Laden.''.
            (10) While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a 
        significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its affiliates 
        and to terrorist organizations around the world, terrorism 
        remains a critical threat to United States national security.
            (11) President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin Laden 
        has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot 
        attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The 
        death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to 
        date in our Nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the 
        best of the intelligence community's capabilities and teamwork;
            (2) for years to come, Americans will look back at this 
        event as a defining point in the history of the United States;
            (3) it is vitally important that the United States 
        memorialize all the events that led to the raid so that future 
        generations will have an official record of the events that 
        transpired before, during, and as a result of the operation; and
            (4) preserving this history now will allow the United States 
        to have an accurate account of the events while those that 
        participated in the events are still serving in the Government.

    (c) Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden.--Not later 
than 90 days after the completion of the report being prepared by the 
Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the history of and 
lessons learned from the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin 
Laden, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit such 
report to the congressional intelligence committees.
    (d) Preservation of Records.--The Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency shall preserve any records, including intelligence 
information and assessments, used to generate the report described in 
subsection (c).

        personnel authorities of Inspectors General of other agencies 
        and departments of the United States, including a comparison of

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the nation's railway transportation (including subway 
        transit) network is broad and technically complex, requiring

        threats;

[[Page 125 STAT. 1897]]

        Intelligence and Analysis maintains a constructive relationship 
        with other Federal agencies, state and local governments, and 
        private entities to safeguard our railways; and
            (3) railway transportation security (including subway 
        transit security) should continue to be prioritized in the
