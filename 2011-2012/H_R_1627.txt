                        OF CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO HOMELESS 
                        VETERANS IN SUPPORTED HOUSING PROGRAM.

    (a) <<NOTE: Contracts.>>  In General.--The Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs shall consider entering into contracts or agreements, under 
sections 513 and 8153 of title 38, United States Code, with eligible 
entities to collaborate with the Secretary in the provision of case 
management services to covered veterans as part of the supported housing 
program carried out under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing 
Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)) to ensure that the homeless 
veterans facing the most significant difficulties in obtaining suitable 
housing receive the assistance they require to obtain such housing.

    (b) Covered Veterans.--For purposes of this section, a covered 
veteran is any veteran who, at the time of receipt of a housing voucher 
under such section 8(o)(19)--
            (1) requires the assistance of a case manager in obtaining 
        suitable housing with such voucher; and
            (2) is having difficulty obtaining the amount of such 
        assistance the veteran requires, including because--
                    (A) the veteran resides in an area that has a 
                shortage of low-income housing and because of such 
                shortage the veteran requires more assistance from a 
                case manager than the Secretary otherwise provides;
                    (B) the location in which the veteran resides is 
                located at such distance from facilities of the 
                Department of Veterans Affairs as makes the provision of 
                case management services by the Secretary to such 
                veteran impractical; or
                    (C) the veteran resides in an area where veterans 
                who receive case management services from the Secretary 
                under such section have a significantly lower average 
                rate of successfully obtaining suitable housing than the 
                average rate of successfully obtaining suitable housing 
                for all veterans receiving such services.

    (c) Eligible Entities.--For purposes of this section, an eligible 
entity is any State or local government agency, tribal organization (as 
such term is defined in section 4 of the Indian Self Determination and

            (1) under a contract or agreement described in subsection 
        (a), agrees--

                covered veterans on an as-needed basis;
                    (B) to maintain referral networks for covered 
                veterans for purposes of assisting covered veterans in 
                demonstrating eligibility for assistance and additional 
                services under entitlement and assistance programs 
                available for covered veterans, and to otherwise aid 
                covered veterans in obtaining such assistance and 
                services;
                    (C) <<NOTE: Confidentiality. Records.>>  to ensure 
                the confidentiality of records maintained by the entity 
                on covered veterans receiving services through the 
                supported housing program described in subsection (a);
                    (D) <<NOTE: Procedures.>>  to establish such
