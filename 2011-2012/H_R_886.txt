To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration 
  of the 225th anniversary of the establishment of the Nation's first 
       Federal law enforcement agency, the United States Marshals 
             Service. <<NOTE: Apr. 2, 2012 -  [H.R. 886]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: United States 
Marshals Service 225th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. 31 USC 5112 
note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Marshals Service 225th 
Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress hereby finds as follows:
            (1) The United States Marshals, the first Federal law 
        enforcement officers in America, were established under section 
        27 of the Act of Congress entitled ``Chapter XX.--An Act to 
        Establish the Judicial Courts of the United States'' and enacted 
        on September 24, 1789 (commonly referred to as the ``Judiciary 
        Act of September 24, 1789''), during the 1st Session of the 1st 
        Congress, and signed into law by the 1st President of the United 
        States, George Washington.
            (2) George Washington had carefully considered the 
        appointments to the Judicial Branch long before the enactment of 
        the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, and nominated the first 
        11 United States Marshals on September 24, and the remaining two 
        Marshals on September 25, 1789. The Senate confirmed all 13 on 
        September 26, 1789, 2 days after the Judiciary Act was signed 
        into law.
            (3) In 1969, by order of the Department of Justice, the 
        United States Marshals Service was created, and achieved Bureau 
        status in 1974. The United States Marshals Service has had major 
        significance in the history of the United States, and has 
        directly contributed to the safety and preservation of this 
        Nation, by serving as an instrument of civil authority used by 
        all 3 branches of the United States Government.
            (4) One of the original 13 United States Marshals, Robert 
        Forsyth of Georgia, a 40-year-old veteran of the Revolutionary 
        War, was the first civilian official of the United States 
        Government, and the first of many United States Marshals and 
        deputies, to be killed in the line of duty when he was shot on 
        January 11, 1794, while trying to serve civil process.
            (5) The United States Marshals Service Commemorative Coin 
        will be the first commemorative coin to honor the United States 
        Marshals Service.

[[Page 126 STAT. 287]]

            (6) The United States should pay tribute to the Nation's 
        oldest Federal law enforcement agency, the United States 
        Marshals Service, by minting and issuing commemorative coins, as 
        provided in this Act.
            (7) A commemorative coin will bring national and 
        international attention to the lasting legacy of this Nation's 
        oldest Federal law enforcement agency.
            (8) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of such 
        commemorative coins will assist the financing of national 
        museums and charitable organizations.

[[Page 126 STAT. 288]]

                          (i) Obverse.--The obverse of the $5 coins 
                      issued under this Act shall bear an image of the 
                      United States Marshals Service Star (also known as 
                      ``America's Star'').
                          (ii) Reverse.--The reverse of the $5 coins 
                      issued under this Act shall bear a design 
                      emblematic of the sacrifice and service of the men 
                      and women of the United States Marshals Service 
                      who lost their lives in the line of duty and 
                      include the Marshals Service motto ``Justice, 
                      Integrity, Service''.

                      issued under this Act shall bear an image of the

                      emblematic of the United States Marshals legendary 
                      status in America's cultural landscape. The image 
                      should depict Marshals as the lawmen of our 
                      frontiers, including their geographic, political, 
                      or cultural history, and shall include the 
                      Marshals Service motto ``Justice, Integrity,

                      clad coins issued under this Act shall bear an 
                      image consistent with the role that the United 
                      States Marshals played in a changing nation, as 
                      they were involved in some of the most pivotal 
                      social issues in American history. The image 
                      should show the ties that the Marshals have to the 
                      United States Constitution, with themes 
                      including--
                                    (I) the Whiskey Rebellion and the 
                                rule of law;
                                    (II) slavery and the legacy of 
                                inequality; and
                                    (III) the struggle between labor and 
                                capital.
            (4) Realistic and historically accurate depictions.--The 
        images for the designs of coins issued under this Act shall be 
        selected on the basis of the realism and historical accuracy of 
        the images and on the extent to which the images are reminiscent 
        of the dramatic and beautiful artwork on coins of the so-called 
        ``Golden Age of Coinage'' in the United States, at the beginning 
        of the 20th Century, with the participation of such noted 
        sculptors and medallic artists as James Earle Fraser, Augustus 
        Saint-Gaudens, Victor David Brenner, Adolph A. Weinman, Charles 
        E. Barber, and George T. Morgan.

    (b) Selection.--The design for the coins minted under this Act shall 
be--
            (1) selected by the Secretary, after consultation with the
