the United States, or a prior international design application 
designating the United States, and a national application shall be 
entitled to the benefit of the filing date of a prior international 
design application designating the United States. If any claim for the 
benefit of an earlier filing date is based on a prior international 
application as defined in section 351(c) which designated but did not 
originate in the United States or a prior international design 
application which designated but did not originate in the United States,

application designating the United States is withdrawn, renounced or 
canceled or considered withdrawn or abandoned, either generally or as to 
the United States, under the conditions of the treaty and the 
Regulations, the designation of the United States shall have no effect 
after the date of withdrawal, renunciation, cancellation, or abandonment 
and shall be considered as not having been made, unless a claim for 
benefit of a prior filing date under section 386(c) was made in a 
national application, or an international design application designating 
the United States, or a claim for benefit under section 365(c) was made 
in an international application designating the United States, filed 
before the date of such withdrawal, renunciation, cancellation, or 
abandonment. However, such withdrawn, renounced, canceled, or abandoned 
international design application may serve as the basis for a claim of 
priority under subsections (a) and (b) of section 386, or under 
subsection (a) or (b) of section 365, if it designated a country other 
than the United States.
``Sec. 389. <<NOTE: 35 USC 389.>> Examination of international

force and effect of a patent issued on an application filed under 
chapter 16.
