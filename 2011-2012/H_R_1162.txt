    (b) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the Reservation is located on the western coast 
                of the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, 
                bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Park 
                on the north, south, and east;
                    (B) most of the Reservation village of La Push is 
                located within the coastal flood plain, with the Tribe's 
                administrative buildings, school, elder center, and 
                housing all located in a tsunami zone;
                    (C) for many decades, the Tribe and the Park have 
                had a dispute over the Reservation boundaries along the 
                Quillayute River;
                    (D) in recent years, this dispute has intensified as 
                the Tribe has faced an urgent need for additional lands 
                for housing, schools, and other Tribe purposes outside 
                the tsunami and Quillayute River flood zones; and
                    (E) the lack of a settlement of this dispute 
                threatens to adversely impact the public's existing and 
                future recreational use of several attractions in the 
                Park that are accessed by the public's use of 
                Reservation lands.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
                    (A) to resolve the longstanding dispute along 
                portions of the northern boundary of the Quileute Indian 
                Reservation;

[[Page 126 STAT. 258]]

                    (B) to clarify public use and access to Olympic 
                National Park lands that are contiguous to the 
                Reservation;
                    (C) to provide the Quileute Indian Tribe with 
                approximately 275 acres of land currently located within 
                the Park and approximately 510 acres of land along the 
                Quillayute River, also within the Park;
                    (D) to adjust the wilderness boundaries to provide 
                the Quileute Indian Tribe Tsunami and flood protection; 
                and
                    (E) through the land conveyance, to grant the Tribe 
                access to land outside of tsunami and Quillayute River 
                flood zones, and link existing Reservation land with 
                Tribe land to the east of the Park.

                      forested landscape of the Tribe-owned headlands 
                      between First and Second Beach in a manner that

                any easements or conditions, and the natural conditions 
                of such land may be altered to allow for the relocation 
                of Tribe members and structures outside the tsunami and 
                Quillayute River flood zones.
                    (D) Protection of infrastructure.--Nothing in this

                parklands by locating buildings and facilities an 
                adequate distance from parklands to prevent damage to 
                these facilities from such threats as hazardous trees 
                and wildfire.

        satisfied and extinguished upon a formal Tribal Council 
        resolution, including claims related to the following:
