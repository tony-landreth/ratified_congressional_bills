SEC. 3. LAND TITLE REPORTS.

    (a) In General.--The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall prepare and 
submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate a 
report regarding the history and experience of Indian tribes that have 
chosen to assume responsibility for operating the Indian Land Title and 
Records Office (referred to in this section as the ``LTRO'') functions 
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (b) Consultation.--In conducting the review under subsection (a), 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall consult with the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development Office of Native American Programs and the 
Indian tribes that are managing LTRO functions (referred to in this 
section as the ``managing Indian tribes'').
    (c) Contents.--The review under subsection (a) shall include an 
analysis of the following factors:
            (1) Whether and how tribal management of the LTRO functions 
        has expedited the processing and issuance of Indian land title 
        certifications as compared to the period during which the Bureau 
        of Indian Affairs managed the programs.
            (2) Whether and how tribal management of the LTRO functions 
        has increased home ownership among the population of the 
        managing Indian tribe.
            (3) What internal preparations and processes were required 
        of the managing Indian tribes prior to assuming management of 
        the LTRO functions.
            (4) Whether tribal management of the LTRO functions resulted 
        in a transfer of financial resources and manpower from the 
        Bureau of Indian Affairs to the managing Indian tribes and, if 
        so, what transfers were undertaken.
            (5) Whether, in appropriate circumstances and with the 
        approval of geographically proximate Indian tribes, the LTRO

[[Page 126 STAT. 1154]]

        functions may be performed by a single Indian tribe or a tribal 
        consortium in a cost effective manner.
