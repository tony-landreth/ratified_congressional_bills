        such employee is a pro rata portion of the unemployment 
        compensation which would otherwise be payable to the employee if 
        such employee were unemployed;

        defined contribution plan (as defined in section 414(i)) to any 
        employee whose workweek is reduced under the program that such 
        benefits will continue to be provided to employees participating 
        in the short-time compensation program under the same terms and 
        conditions as though the workweek of such employee had not been 
        reduced

        the short-time compensation program;

        employer to submit a written plan describing the manner in which

        an employee whose workweek is to be reduced) together with an 
        estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred 
        absent the ability to participate in short-time compensation and 
        such other information as the Secretary of Labor determines is 
        appropriate;

        on the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as

    (a) Reverse Auction to Identify Incentive Amount.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  In general.--The Commission 
        shall conduct a reverse auction to determine the amount of 
        compensation that each broadcast television licensee would 
        accept in return for voluntarily relinquishing some or all of 
        its broadcast television spectrum usage rights in order to make 
        spectrum available for assignment through a system of 
        competitive bidding under subparagraph (G) of section 309(j)(8) 
        of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by section 6402.
            (2) Eligible relinquishments.--A relinquishment of usage 
        rights for purposes of paragraph (1) shall include the 
        following:
                    (A) Relinquishing all usage rights with respect to a 
                particular television channel without receiving in 
                return any usage rights with respect to another 
                television channel.
                    (B) Relinquishing all usage rights with respect to 
                an ultra high frequency television channel in return for 
                receiving usage rights with respect to a very high 
                frequency television channel.
                    (C) Relinquishing usage rights in order to share a 
                television channel with another licensee.
            (3) Confidentiality.--The Commission shall take all 
        reasonable steps necessary to protect the confidentiality of 
        Commission-held data of a licensee participating in the reverse 
        auction under paragraph (1), including withholding the identity 
        of such licensee until the reassignments and reallocations (if 
        any) under subsection (b)(1)(B) become effective, as described 
        in subsection (f)(2).

[[Page 126 STAT. 226]]

            (4) Protection of carriage rights of licensees sharing a 
        channel.--A broadcast television station that voluntarily 
        relinquishes spectrum usage rights under this subsection in

        of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 338; 534; 535) on November 30, 2010, shall 
        have, at its shared location, the carriage rights under such 
        section that would apply to such station at such location if it 
        were not sharing a channel.

    (b) Reorganization of Broadcast TV Spectrum.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of making available spectrum 
        to carry out the forward auction under subsection (c)(1), the 
        Commission--
                    (A) shall evaluate the broadcast television spectrum 
                (including spectrum made available through the reverse 
                auction under subsection (a)(1)); and
                    (B) may, subject to international coordination along 
                the border with Mexico and Canada--
                          (i) make such reassignments of television 
                      channels as the Commission considers appropriate; 
                      and
                          (ii) reallocate such portions of such spectrum 
                      as the Commission determines are available for 
                      reallocation.
            (2) Factors for consideration.--In making any reassignments 
        or reallocations under paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall 
        make all reasonable efforts to preserve, as of the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the coverage area and population served 
        of each broadcast television licensee, as determined using the 
        methodology described in OET Bulletin 69 of the Office of 
        Engineering and Technology of the Commission.
            (3) No involuntary relocation from uhf to vhf.--In making 
        any reassignments under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the Commission may 
        not involuntarily reassign a broadcast television licensee--
                    (A) from an ultra high frequency television channel 
                to a very high frequency television channel; or
                    (B) from a television channel between the 
                frequencies from 174 megahertz to 216 megahertz to a 
                television channel between the frequencies from 54 
                megahertz to 88 megahertz.
            (4) Payment of relocation costs.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), from amounts made available under subsection 
                (d)(2), the Commission shall reimburse costs reasonably 
                incurred by--
                          (i) a broadcast television licensee that was 
                      reassigned under paragraph (1)(B)(i) from one 
                      ultra high frequency television channel to a 
                      different ultra high frequency television channel, 
                      from one very high frequency television channel to 
                      a different very high frequency television 
                      channel, or, in accordance with subsection 
                      (g)(1)(B), from a very high frequency television 
                      channel to an ultra high frequency television 
                      channel, in order for the licensee to relocate its 
                      television service from one channel to the other;

[[Page 126 STAT. 227]]

                          (ii) a multichannel video programming 
                      distributor in order to continue to carry the 
                      signal of a broadcast television licensee that--
                                    (I) is described in clause (i);
                                    (II) voluntarily relinquishes 
                                spectrum usage rights under subsection 
                                (a) with respect to an ultra high 
                                frequency television channel in return 
                                for receiving usage rights with respect 
                                to a very high frequency television 
                                channel; or
                                    (III) voluntarily relinquishes 
                                spectrum usage rights under subsection

                                another licensee; or
                          (iii) a channel 37 incumbent user, in order to 
                      relocate to other suitable spectrum, provided that 
                      all such users can be relocated and that the total 
                      relocation costs of such users do not exceed 
                      $300,000,000. For the purpose of this section, the 
                      spectrum made available through relocation of 
                      channel 37 incumbent users shall be deemed as 
                      spectrum reclaimed through a reverse auction under 
                      section 6403(a).
                    (B) <<NOTE: Waiver.>>  Regulatory relief.--In lieu 
                of reimbursement for relocation costs under subparagraph 
                (A), a broadcast television licensee may accept, and the 
                Commission may grant as it considers appropriate, a 
                waiver of the service rules of the Commission to permit 
                the licensee, subject to interference protections, to 
                make flexible use of the spectrum assigned to the 
                licensee to provide services other than broadcast 
                television services. Such waiver shall only remain in 
                effect while the licensee provides at least 1 broadcast 
                television program stream on such spectrum at no charge 
                to the public.
                    (C) Limitation.--The Commission may not make 
                reimbursements under subparagraph (A) for lost revenues.
                    (D) Deadline.--The Commission shall make all 
                reimbursements required by subparagraph (A) not later 
                than the date that is 3 years after the completion of 
                the forward auction under subsection (c)(1).
            (5) Low-power television usage rights.--Nothing in this 
        subsection shall be construed to alter the spectrum usage rights 
        of low-power television stations.

    (c) Forward Auction.--
            (1) Auction required.--The Commission shall conduct a 
        forward auction in which--
                    (A) the Commission assigns licenses for the use of 
                the spectrum that the Commission reallocates under 
                subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii); and
                    (B) the amount of the proceeds that the Commission 
                shares under clause (i) of section 309(j)(8)(G) of the 
                Communications Act of 1934 with each licensee whose bid 
                the Commission accepts in the reverse auction under 
                subsection (a)(1) is not less than the amount of such 
                bid.
            (2) Minimum proceeds.--
                    (A) In general.--If the amount of the proceeds from 
                the forward auction under paragraph (1) is not greater 
                than the sum described in subparagraph (B), no licenses 
                shall be assigned through such forward auction, no 
                reassignments or reallocations under subsection 
                (b)(1)(B)

                revoke any spectrum usage rights by reason of a bid that 
                the Commission accepts in the reverse auction under 
                subsection (a)(1).

                          (ii) the costs of conducting such forward

                      U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(B)); and
                          (iii) the estimated costs for which the

                Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(B))

                Commission in conducting the reverse auction under 
                subsection (a)(1), conducting the evaluation of the

[[Page 126 STAT. 229]]

            (4) Transfer of unused funds.--If any amounts remain in the 
        TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund after the date that is 3 years
