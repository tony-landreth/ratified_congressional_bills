Public Law 112-210
112th Congress

                                 An Act


 
   To allow for innovations and alternative technologies that meet or 
     exceed desired energy efficiency goals, and to make technical 
corrections to existing Federal energy efficiency laws to allow American 
  manufacturers to remain competitive. <<NOTE: Dec. 18, 2012 -  [H.R. 
                                6582]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: American Energy 
Manufacturing Technical Corrections Act. 42 USC 6201 note.>>
