        infection, in vitro techniques, valid microbiological surrogate 
        markers, the use of noninferiority versus superiority trials, 
        trial enrollment, data requirements, and appropriate delta 
        values for noninferiority trials.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Except to the extent to which the 
        Secretary makes revisions under paragraph (1)(B), nothing in 
        this section shall be construed to repeal or otherwise effect 
        the guidance documents of the Food and Drug Administration.

    (b) Recommendations for Investigations.--

               TITLE IX--DRUG APPROVAL AND PATIENT ACCESS

SEC. 901. ENHANCEMENT OF ACCELERATED PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW MEDICAL 
                        TREATMENTS.

    (a) <<NOTE: 21 USC 356 note.>> Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
                    (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in 
                this section as the ``FDA'') serves a critical role in 
                helping to assure that new medicines are safe and 
                effective. Regulatory innovation is 1 element of the 
                Nation's strategy to address serious and life-
                threatening diseases or conditions by promoting 
                investment in and development of innovative treatments 
                for unmet medical needs.
                    (B) During the 2 decades following the establishment 
                of the accelerated approval mechanism, advances in 
                medical sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, 
                and bioinformatics, have provided an unprecedented 
                understanding of the underlying biological mechanism and 
                pathogenesis of disease. A new generation of modern, 
                targeted medicines is under development to treat serious 
                and life-threatening diseases, some applying drug 
                development strategies based on biomarkers or 
                pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial 
                enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, 
                such as adaptive clinical trials.
                    (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and 
                medical advances, the FDA should be encouraged to 
                implement more broadly effective processes for the 
                expedited development and review of innovative new 
                medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for 
                serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, 
                including those for rare diseases or conditions, using a 
                broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and 
                modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development 
                cycle when appropriate. This may result in fewer, 
                smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended 
                patient population or targeted subpopulation

[[Page 126 STAT. 1083]]

                without compromising or altering the high standards of 
                the FDA for the approval of drugs.
                    (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe 
                and effective innovative therapies to treat unmet 
                medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases 
                or conditions.
                    (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in 
                effect on the day before the date of enactment of this 
                Act governing expedited approval of drugs for serious or 
                life-threatening diseases or conditions should be 
                amended in order to enhance the authority of the FDA to 
                consider appropriate scientific data, methods, and 
                tools, and to expedite development and access to novel 
                treatments for patients with a broad range of serious or 
                life-threatening diseases or conditions.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated 
        approval and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 of 
        the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as 
        amended by this section, to help expedite the development and 
        availability to patients of treatments for serious or life-
        threatening diseases or conditions while maintaining safety and 
        effectiveness standards for such treatments.

    (b) Expedited Approval of Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening 
Diseases or Conditions.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. 356) is amended to read 
as follows:
``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-
                        THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.

    ``(a) Designation of Drug as Fast Track Product.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of 
        the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and 
        expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether 
        alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the 
        treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, 
        and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs 
        for such a disease or condition. (In this section, such a drug 
        is referred to as a `fast track product'.)
            ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug 
        may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track 
        product. A request for the designation may be made concurrently 
        with, or at any time after, submission of an application for the 
        investigation of the drug under section 505(i) or section 
        351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act.
            ``(3) <<NOTE: Deadline. Determination.>> Designation.--
        Within 60 calendar days after the receipt of a request under 
        paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine whether the drug 
        that is the subject of the request meets the criteria described 
        in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that the drug meets the 
        criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug as a fast track 
        product and shall take such actions as are appropriate to 
        expedite the development and review of the application for 
        approval of such product.

    ``(b) Accelerated Approval of a Drug for a Serious or Life-
Threatening Disease or Condition, Including a Fast Track Product.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Accelerated approval.--The Secretary may 
                approve an application for approval of a product for a

                serious or life-threatening disease or condition, 
                including a fast track product, under section 505(c) or 
                section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act upon a 
                determination that the product has an effect on a 
                surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict 
                clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be 
                measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or 
                mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an 
                effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other 
                clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, 
                rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the 
                availability or lack of alternative treatments. The 
                approval described in the preceding sentence is referred 
                to in this section as `accelerated approval'.
                    ``(B) Evidence.--The evidence to support that an 
                endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical 
                benefit under subparagraph (A) may include 
                epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, 
                pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using 
                biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or 
                tools.
            ``(2) Limitation.--Approval of a product under this 
        subsection may be subject to 1 or both of the following 
        requirements:
                    ``(A) That the sponsor conduct appropriate 
                postapproval studies to verify and describe the 
                predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality 
                or other clinical benefit.
                    
                ``(B) <<NOTE: Records. Determination. Deadline.>> That 
                the sponsor submit copies of all promotional materials 
                related to the product during the preapproval review 
                period and, following approval and for such period 
                thereafter as the Secretary determines to be 
                appropriate, at least 30 days prior to dissemination of 
                the materials.
            ``(3) <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Expedited withdrawal of 
        approval.--The Secretary may withdraw approval of a product 
        approved under accelerated approval using expedited procedures 
        (as prescribed by the Secretary in regulations which shall 
        include an opportunity for an informal hearing) if--
                    ``(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required 
                postapproval study of the drug with due diligence;
                    ``(B) a study required to verify and describe the 
                predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality

                and describe such effect or benefit;
                    ``(C) other evidence demonstrates that the product 
                is not safe or effective under the conditions of use; or

        determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data 
        submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be 
        effective, the Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and may 
        commence review of portions of, an application for the approval 
        of the product before the sponsor submits a complete 
        application. The Secretary shall commence such review only if 
        the applicant--

        year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
        Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the 
        ``Secretary'') shall issue draft guidance to implement the 
        amendments made by this section. In developing such guidance, 
        the Secretary shall specifically consider issues arising under 
        the accelerated approval and fast track processes under section 
        506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by 
        subsection (b), for drugs designated for a rare disease or 
        condition under section 526 of such Act (21 U.S.C. 360bb) and 
        shall also consider any unique issues associated with very rare 
        diseases.

        Not later than 1 year after the issuance of draft guidance under 
        paragraph (1), and after an opportunity for public comment, the 
        Secretary shall--
                    (A) issue final guidance; and
                    (B) amend the regulations governing accelerated 
                approval in parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of 
                Federal Regulations, as necessary to conform such 
                regulations with the amendment made by subsection (b).
            (3) Consideration.--In developing the guidance under 
        paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) and the amendments under paragraph 
        (2)(B), the Secretary shall consider how to incorporate novel 
        approaches to the review of surrogate endpoints based on 
        pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence in such guidance, 
        especially in instances where the low prevalence of a disease 
        renders the existence or collection of other types of data 
        unlikely or impractical.
            (4) Conforming changes.--The Secretary shall issue, as 
        necessary, conforming amendments to the applicable regulations 
        under title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, governing 
        accelerated approval.

            ``(1) Drug.--The term `drug' excludes any controlled 
        substance (as such term is defined in section 102 of the 
        Controlled Substances Act).
            ``(2) Health system.--The term `health system' means a 
        collection of hospitals that are owned and operated by the same 
        entity and that share access to databases with drug order 
        information for their patients.
            ``(3) Repackage.--For the purposes of this section only, the 
        term `repackage', with respect to a drug, means to divide the 
        volume of a drug into smaller amounts in order to--
                    ``(A) extend the supply of a drug in response to the 
                placement of the drug on a drug shortage list under 
                section 506E; and
                    ``(B) facilitate access to the drug by hospitals 
                within the same health system.

    ``(b) Exclusion From Registration.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, a hospital shall not be considered an 
establishment for which registration is required under section 510 
solely because it repackages a drug and transfers it to another hospital 
within the same health system in accordance with the conditions in 
subsection (c)--
            ``(1) during any period in which the drug is listed on the 
        drug shortage list under section 506E; or
            ``(2) during the 60-day period following any period 
        described in paragraph (1).

    ``(c) Conditions.--Subsection (b) shall only apply to a hospital, 
with respect to the repackaging of a drug for transfer to another 
hospital within the same health system, if the following conditions are 
met:
            ``(1) Drug for intrasystem use only.--In no case may a drug 
        that has been repackaged in accordance with this section be sold 
        or otherwise distributed by the health system or a hospital 
        within the system to an entity or individual that is not a 
        hospital within such health system.
            ``(2) Compliance with state rules.--Repackaging of a drug 
        under this section shall be done in compliance with applicable 
        State requirements of each State in which the drug is repackaged 
        and received.

date on which the Secretary issues final guidance that clarifies the 
policy of the Food and Drug Administration regarding hospital

hospitals within the same health system during a drug shortage.''.
SEC. 1008. STUDY ON DRUG SHORTAGES.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study to examine the cause of drug shortages and formulate 
recommendations on how to prevent or alleviate such shortages.
    (b) Consideration.--In conducting the study under this section, the 
Comptroller General shall consider the following questions:
            (1) What are the dominant characteristics of drugs that have 
        gone into a drug shortage over the preceding 3 years?
            (2) Are there systemic high-risk factors (such as drug 
        pricing structure, including Federal reimbursements, or the 
        number of manufacturers producing a drug product) that have led 
        to the concentration of drug shortages in certain drug products 
        that have made such products vulnerable to drug shortages?
            (3) Is there a reason why drug shortages have occurred 
        primarily in the sterile injectable market and in certain 
        therapeutic areas?
            (4)(A) How have regulations, guidance documents, regulatory 
        practices, policies, and other actions of Federal departments 
        and agencies (including the effectiveness of interagency and 
        intra-agency coordination, communication, strategic planning, 
        and decisionmaking), including those used to enforce statutory 
        requirements, affected drug shortages?
            (B) Do any such regulations, guidances, policies, or 
        practices cause, exacerbate, prevent, or mitigate drug 
        shortages?
            (C) How can regulations, guidances, policies, or practices 
        be modified, streamlined, expanded, or discontinued in order to 
        reduce or prevent such drug shortages?
            (D) What effect would the changes described in subparagraph 
        (C) have on the public health?
            (5) How does hoarding affect drug shortages?
            (6) How would incentives alleviate or prevent drug 
        shortages?
            (7) To what extent are health care providers, including 
        hospitals and physicians responding to drug shortages, able to 
        adjust care effectively to compensate for such shortages, and 
        what impediments exist that hinder provider ability to adjust to 
        such shortages?
            (8)(A) Have drug shortages led market participants to 
        stockpile affected drugs or sell such drugs at inflated prices?
            (B) What has been the impact of any such activities 
        described in subparagraph (A) on Federal revenue, and are there 
        any economic factors that have exacerbated or created a market 
        for such activities?
            (C) Is there a need for any additional reporting or 
        enforcement actions to address such activities?
            (9)(A) How have the activities under section 506D of the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by section 1003 
        of this Act) improved the efforts of the Food and Drug 
        Administration to mitigate and prevent drug shortages?
            (B) Is there a need to continue the task force and strategic 
        plan under such section 506D, or are there any other 
        recommendations to increase communication and coordination

[[Page 126 STAT. 1108]]

        inside the Food and Drug Administration, between the Food and 
        Drug Administration and other agencies, and between the Food and 
        Drug Administration and stakeholders?

    (c) Consultation With Stakeholders.--In conducting the study under 
this section, the Comptroller General shall consult with relevant 
stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, patients, 
drug manufacturers, and other health providers.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate on 
the results of the study under this section.
