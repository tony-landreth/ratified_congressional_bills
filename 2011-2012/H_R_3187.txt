of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Franklin Roosevelt's personal struggle with 
        polio led him to create the National Foundation for Infantile 
        Paralysis (now known as the March of Dimes) on January 3, 1938, 
        at a time when polio was on the rise.
            (2) The Foundation established patient aid programs and 
        funded research for polio vaccines developed by Jonas Salk, MD, 
        and Albert Sabin, MD.
            (3) Tested in a massive field trial in 1954 that involved 
        1.8 million schoolchildren known as ``polio pioneers'', the Salk 
        vaccine was licensed for use on April 12, 1955 as ``safe, 
        effective, and potent''. The Salk and Sabin polio vaccines 
        funded by the March of Dimes ended the polio epidemic in the 
        United States.
            (4) With its original mission accomplished, the Foundation 
        turned its focus to preventing birth defects, prematurity, and 
        infant mortality in 1958. The Foundation began to fund research 
        into the genetic, prenatal, and environmental causes of over 
        3,000 birth defects.
            (5) The Foundation's investment in research has led to 13 
        scientists winning the Nobel Prize since 1954, including Dr. 
        James Watson's discovery of the double helix.
            (6) Virginia Apgar, MD, creator of the Apgar Score, helped 
        develop the Foundation's mission for birth defects prevention; 
        joining the Foundation as the head of its new birth defects 
        division in 1959.
            (7) In the 1960s, the Foundation created over 100 birth 
        defects treatment centers, and then turned its attention to 
        assisting in the development of Neonatal Intensive Care Units, 
        or NICUs.
            (8) With March of Dimes support, a Committee on Perinatal 
        Health released Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy in 
        1976, which included recommendations that led to the 
        regionalization of perinatal health care in the United States.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1511]]

            (9) Since 1998, the March of Dimes has advocated for and 
        witnessed the passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act, 
        Children's Health Act, PREEMIE Act, and Newborn Screening Save 
        Lives Act.
            (10) In 2003, the March of Dimes launched a Prematurity 
        Campaign to increase awareness about and reduce the incidence of 
        preterm birth, infant mortality, birth defects, and lifelong 
        disabilities and disorders.
            (11) The March of Dimes actively promotes programs for and 
        funds research into newborn screening, pulmonary surfactant 
        therapy, maternal nutrition, smoking cessation, folic acid 
        consumption to prevent neural tube defects, increased access to 
        maternity care, and similar programs to improve maternal and 
        infant health.
