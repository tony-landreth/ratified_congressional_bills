112th Congress

                                 An Act


 
   To provide for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iran's growing 
 hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 28, 2012 -  [H.R. 3783]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Countering Iran 
in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012. 22 USC 8701 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Iran in the Western 
Hemisphere Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has vital political, economic, and 
        security interests in the Western Hemisphere.
            (2) Iran is pursuing cooperation with Latin American 
        countries by signing economic and security agreements in order 
        to create a network of diplomatic and economic relationships to 
        lessen the blow of international sanctions and oppose Western 
        attempts to constrict its ambitions.
            (3) According to the Department of State, Hezbollah, with 
        Iran as its state sponsor, is considered the ``most technically 
        capable terrorist group in the world'' with ``thousands of 
        supporters, several thousand members, and a few hundred 
        terrorist operatives,'' and officials from the Iranian Islamic 
        Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force have been working in 
        concert with Hezbollah for many years.
            (4) The IRGC's Qods Force has a long history of supporting 
        Hezbollah's military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, 
        providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and 
        logistical support, and in 2007, the Department of the Treasury 
        placed sanctions on the IRGC and its Qods Force for their 
        support of terrorism and proliferation activities.
            (5) The IRGC's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign 
        embassies, charities, and religious and cultural institutions to 
        foster relationships, often building on existing socioeconomic 
        ties with the well established Shia Diaspora, and recent years 
        have witnessed an increased presence in Latin America.
            (6) According to the Department of Defense, the IRGC and its 
        Qods Force played a significant role in some of the deadliest 
        terrorist attacks of the past two decades, including the 1994 
        attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, by 
        generally directing or supporting the groups that actually 
        executed the attacks.
            (7) Reports of Iranian intelligence agents being implicated 
        in Hezbollah-linked activities since the early 1990s suggest

[[Page 126 STAT. 1597]]

        direct Iranian government support of Hezbollah activities in the 
        Tri-Border Area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and in the 
        past decade, Iran has dramatically increased its diplomatic 
        missions to Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Argentina, 
        and Brazil. Iran has built 17 cultural centers in Latin America, 
        and it currently maintains 11 embassies, up from 6 in 2005.
            (8) Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies with a presence in 
        Latin America have raised revenues through illicit activities, 
        including drug and arms trafficking, counterfeiting, money 
        laundering, forging travel documents, pirating software and 
        music, and providing haven and assistance to other terrorists 
        transiting the region.
            (9) Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela 
        expressed their intention to assist Iran in evading sanctions by 
        signing a statement supporting Iran's nuclear activities and 
        announcing at a 2010 joint press conference in Tehran their 
        determination to ``continue and expand their economic ties to 
        Iran'' with confidence that ``Iran can give a crushing response 
        to the threats and sanctions imposed by the West and 
        imperialism''.
            (10) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in 
        2008 that almost one-half of the foreign terrorist organizations 
        in the world are linked to narcotics trade and trafficking, 
        including Hezbollah and Hamas.
            (11) In October 2011, the United States charged two men, 
        Manssor Arbabsiar, a United States citizen holding both Iranian 
        and United States passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based 
        member of Iran's IRGC Qods Force, with conspiracy to murder a 
        foreign official using explosives in an act of terrorism. 
        Arbabsiar traveled to Mexico with the express intent to hire 
        ``someone in the narcotics business'' to carry out the 
        assassination of the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in the United 
        States. While in the end, he only engaged a U.S. Drug 
        Enforcement Agency informant posing as an associate of a drug 
        trafficking cartel, Arbabsiar believed that he was working with 
        a member of a Mexican drug trafficking organization and sought 
        to send money to this individual in installments and not in a 
        single transfer.
            (12) In February 2011, actions by the Department of the 
        Treasury effectively shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank. 
        Subsequent actions by the United States Government in connection 
        with the investigation into Lebanese Canadian Bank resulted in 
        the indictment in December 2011 of Ayman Joumaa, an individual 
        of Lebanese nationality, with citizenship in Lebanon and 
        Colombia, and with ties to Hezbollah, for trafficking cocaine to 
        the Los Zetas drug trafficking organization in Mexico City for 
        sale in the United States and for laundering the proceeds.
