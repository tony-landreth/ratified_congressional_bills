    (b) <<NOTE: 23 USC 101 note.>> Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise

[[Page 126 STAT. 415]]

                program, discrimination and related barriers continue to 
                pose significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned 
                businesses seeking to do business in federally-assisted 
                surface transportation markets across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
                documentation of race and gender discrimination from 
                numerous sources, including congressional hearings and 
                roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address 
                the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.

                          (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``small business

                      economically disadvantaged individual or 
                      individuals that have average annual gross

                      excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted annually by the 
                      Secretary for inflation.
                    (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals.--The term ``socially and economically

                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations 
                issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be

        concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals.

[[Page 126 STAT. 416]]

            (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.--

                concerns referred to in paragraph (2) in the State, 
                including the location of the small business concerns in 
                the State; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Notification.>> notify the Secretary, in 
                writing, of the percentage of the small business 
                concerns that are controlled by--
                          (i) women;
                          (ii) socially and economically disadvantaged 
                      individuals (other than women); and
                          (iii) individuals who are women and are 
                      otherwise socially and economically disadvantaged 
                      individuals.
            (5) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish 
                minimum uniform criteria for use by State governments in 
                certifying whether a concern qualifies as a small 
                business concern for the purpose of this subsection.
                    (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall include, with 
                respect to a potential small business concern--
                          (i) on-site visits;
                          (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                          (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;

        requirements for use by State governments in reporting to the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) information concerning disadvantaged business 
                enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and
                    (B) such other information as the Secretary 
                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under divisions A and B of this Act 
        and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if the entity 
        or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from complying with 
        paragraph (2) because a Federal court issues a final order in 
        which the court finds that a requirement or the implementation 
        of paragraph (2) is unconstitutional.

than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, for the repair or 
reconstruction of any road, highway, or bridge that is in operation or 
under construction when damaged by an emergency declared by the Governor 
of the State and concurred in by the Secretary, or for a disaster or 
emergency declared by the President pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), 
the Secretary shall publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to treat any 
such repair or reconstruction activity as a class of action 
categorically excluded from the requirements relating to environmental 
assessments or environmental impact statements under section 1508.4 of 
title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, and section 771.117 of title 23, 
Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of 
this Act) if such repair or reconstruction activity is--
            (1) in the same location with the same capacity, dimensions, 
        and design as the original road, highway, or bridge as before 
        the declaration described in this section; and
            (2) commenced within a 2-year period beginning on the date 
        of a declaration described in this section.

    (b) Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure that the 
        rulemaking helps to conserve Federal resources and protects 
        public safety and health by providing for periodic evaluations 
        to determine if reasonable alternatives exist to roads, 
        highways, or bridges that repeatedly require repair and 
        reconstruction activities.
            (2) Reasonable alternatives.--The reasonable alternatives 
        described in paragraph (1) include actions that could reduce the 
        need for Federal funds to be expended on such repair and 
        reconstruction activities, better protect public safety and 
        health and the environment, and meet transportation needs as 
        described in relevant and applicable Federal, State, local and 
        tribal plans.

    (a) In General.--In preparing a final environmental impact statement 
under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
seq.), if the lead agency modifies the statement in response to comments 
that are minor and are confined to factual corrections or explanations 
of why the comments do not warrant additional agency response, the lead 
agency may write on errata sheets attached to the statement instead of 
rewriting the draft statement, subject to the condition that the errata 
sheets--
            (1) cite the sources, authorities, or reasons that support 
        the position of the agency; and
            (2) if appropriate, indicate the circumstances that would 
        trigger agency reappraisal or further response.

    (b) Incorporation.--To the maximum extent practicable, the lead 
agency shall expeditiously develop a single document that consists of a 
final environmental impact statement and a record of decision, unless--
            (1) the final environmental impact statement makes

                          AGREEMENTS FOR EARLY COORDINATION.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant 
        jurisdiction in the environmental review process should 
        cooperate with each other and other agencies on environmental 
        review and project delivery activities at the earliest 
        practicable

[[Page 126 STAT. 552]]

        time to avoid delays and duplication of effort later in the 
        process, head off potential conflicts, and ensure that planning 
        and project development decisions reflect environmental values; 
        and
            (2) such cooperation should include the development of 
        policies and the designation of staff that advise planning 
        agencies or project sponsors of studies or other information 
        foreseeably required for later Federal action and early 
        consultation with appropriate State and local agencies and 
        Indian tribes.

    (b) Technical Assistance.--If requested at any time by a State or 
local planning agency, the Secretary and other Federal agencies with 
relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, shall, to the 
extent practicable and appropriate, as determined by the agencies, 
provide technical assistance to the State or local planning agency on 
accomplishing the early coordination activities described in subsection 
(d).
    (c) Memorandum of Agency Agreement.--If requested at any time by a 
State or local planning agency, the lead agency, in consultation with 
other Federal agencies with relevant jurisdiction in the environmental 
review process, may establish memoranda of agreement with the project 
sponsor, State, and local governments and other appropriate entities to 
accomplish the early coordination activities described in subsection 
(d).
    (d) Early Coordination Activities.--Early coordination activities 
shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, the following:
            (1) Technical assistance on identifying potential impacts 
        and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.
            (2) The potential appropriateness of using planning products 
        and decisions in later environmental reviews.
            (3) The identification and elimination from detailed study 
        in the environmental review process of the issues that are not 
        significant or that have been covered by prior environmental 
        reviews.
            (4) The identification of other environmental review and 
        consultation requirements so that the lead and cooperating 
        agencies may prepare, as appropriate, other required analyses 
        and studies concurrently with planning activities.
            (5) The identification by agencies with jurisdiction over 
        any permits related to the project of any and all relevant 
        information that will reasonably be required for the project.
            (6) The reduction of duplication between requirements under 
        the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
        seq.) and State and local planning and environmental review 
        requirements, unless the agencies are specifically barred from 
        doing so by applicable law.
            (7) Timelines for the completion of agency actions during 
        the planning and environmental review processes.
            (8) Other appropriate factors.

        protect workers on highway construction projects in long-
        duration stationary work zones when the project design speed is 
        anticipated to be high and the nature of the work requires 
        workers to be within 1 lane-width from the edge of a live travel 
        lane, unless--

                the annual average daily traffic load of the applicable 
                road is less than 100 vehicles per hour; and
            (3) when positive protective devices are necessary for 
        highway construction projects, those devices are paid for on a 
        unit-pay basis, unless doing so would create a conflict with 
        innovative contracting approaches, such as design-build or some 
        performance-based contracts under which the contractor is paid 
        to assume a certain risk allocation and payment is generally 
        made on a lump-sum basis.

SEC. 1536. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON HARBOR MAINTENANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there are 926 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors 
        maintained by the Corps of Engineers;
            (2) according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics--
                    (A) in 2009, the ports and waterways of the United 
                States handled more than 2,200,000,000 short tons of 
                imports, exports, and domestic shipments; and
                    (B) in 2010, United States ports were responsible 
                for more than $1,400,000,000,000 in waterborne imports 
                and exports;
            (3) according to the Congressional Research Service, full 
        channel dimensions are, on average, available approximately \1/
        3\ of the time at the 59 harbors of the United States with the 
        highest use rates;
            (4) in 1986, Congress created the Harbor Maintenance Trust 
        Fund to provide funds for the operation and maintenance of the 
        navigation channels of the United States;
            (5) in fiscal year 2012, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
        is expected to grow from $6,280,000,000 to $7,011,000,000, an 
        increase of approximately 13 percent;
            (6) despite growth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, 
        expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund have not 
        been sufficiently spent; and
            (7) inadequate investment in dredging needs is restricting 
        access to the ports of the United States for domestic shipping, 
        imports, and exports and therefore threatening the economic 
        competitiveness of the United States.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Administration should request full use of the Harbor 
        Maintenance Trust Fund for operating and maintaining the 
        navigation channels of the United States;
            (2) the amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund should 
        be fully expended to operate and maintain the navigation 
        channels of the United States; and
            (3) Congress should ensure that other programs, projects, 
        and activities of the Civil Works Program of the Corps of 
        Engineers, especially those programs, projects, and activities 
        relating to inland navigation and flood control, are not 
        adversely impacted.

        maintained using appropriations from the Harbor Maintenance 
        Trust Fund that would result from harbor maintenance activities 
        to be funded by the budget request; and
            (2) an estimate of the average annual amount of 
        appropriations from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund that would 
        be required to increase that average availability to 95 percent 
        over a 3-year period.

                      performance-based planning as a tool for guiding

comment, since individual projects included in the statewide 
transportation plans and the transportation improvement program are 
subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and since decisions by the Secretary 
concerning statewide transportation plans or the transportation 
improvement program described in this section have not been reviewed

        score. The Secretary shall work with the bus testing facility, 
        bus manufacturers, and transit agencies to develop the bus model 
        scoring system under this paragraph. A passing aggregate test

        only that amounts appropriated or made available under this 
        chapter may be obligated or expended to acquire a new bus model 
        and shall not be interpreted as a warranty or guarantee that the 
        new bus model will meet a purchaser's specific requirements.''.

recipient of assistance under this chapter may not deny reasonable 
access for a private intercity or charter transportation operator to 
federally funded public transportation facilities, including intermodal

determining reasonable access, capacity requirements of the recipient of 
assistance and the extent to which access would be detrimental to 
existing public transportation services must be considered.''.

                is allowed to

[[Page 126 STAT. 817]]

                operate and the effect that any such diversion would 
                have on other modes of transportation;
                    (B) the effect that any such diversion would have on 
                public safety, infrastructure, cost responsibilities, 
                fuel efficiency, freight transportation costs, and the 
                environment;

for adjustment of claims) in selling, writing, and servicing standard

reimbursed in both catastrophic and noncatastrophic years. Such

actual expenses, including standard business costs and operating 
expenses, of such companies as closely as practicably possible.

effective date of the final rule issued pursuant to subsection (d), the

                adequate progress on the reconstruction or improvement 
                of a flood protection system if--
                          (i) 100 percent of the project cost has been

                      or construction of the improvement commences.
                    (B) Considerations.--In determining whether a flood 
                protection system has been assessed as being without 
                deficiencies, the Administrator shall consider the 
                requirements under section 65.10 of chapter 44, Code of 
                Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.

        located has made adequate progress on the reconstruction or 
        improvement of the flood protection system.
            (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        be construed to prohibit the Administrator from making a 
        determination under paragraph (2) for any community in which a 
        flood protection system is not undergoing reconstruction or 
        improvement on the date of enactment of this Act.

    (b) Termination of Eligibility.--

                has not made adequate continuing progress; or
                    (B) on the date that is 5 years after the date on 
                which the reconstruction or construction of the 
                improvement commences, the project has not been 
                completed.
            (3) Waiver.--A person whose eligibility would otherwise be 
        terminated under paragraph (2)(B) shall continue to be eligible 
        to purchase flood insurance coverage described in subsection (a) 
        if the Administrator determines--
                    (A) the community has made adequate continuing 
                progress on the reconstruction or improvement of a flood 
                protection system; and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  there is a reasonable 
                expectation that the reconstruction or improvement of 
                the flood protection system will be completed not later 
                than 1 year after the date of the determination under 
                this paragraph.
            (4) Risk premium rate.--If the Administrator terminates the 
        eligibility of persons residing in a community to purchase flood 
        insurance coverage described in subsection (a), the 
        Administrator shall establish an appropriate risk premium rate 
        for flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance 
        Program for persons residing in the community that purchased 
        flood insurance coverage before the date on which the 
        termination of eligibility takes effect, taking into 
        consideration the then-current state of the flood protection 
        system.

    (c) Additional Authority.--
            (1) Additional authority.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), 
        in exceptional and exigent circumstances, the Administrator

[[Page 126 STAT. 949]]

        may, in the Administrator's sole discretion, determine that a 
        person residing in a community, which is a participant in the 
        National Flood Insurance Program, that has begun reconstruction 
        or improvement of a flood protection system that will afford 
        flood protection for a 100-year floodplain (without regard to 
        the level of Federal funding of or participation in the 
        reconstruction or improvement) shall be eligible for flood 
        insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program at 
        a risk premium rate that does not exceed the risk premium rate 
        that would be chargeable if the flood protection system had been 
        completed, provided--
                    (A) the community makes a written request for the 
                determination setting forth the exceptional and exigent 
                circumstances, including why the community cannot meet 
                the criteria for adequate progress set forth in under 
                subsection (a)(2)(A) and why immediate relief is 
                necessary;
                    (B) <<NOTE: Reports. Deadline.>>  the Administrator 
                submits a written report setting forth findings of the 
                exceptional and exigent circumstances on which the 
                Administrator based an affirmative determination to the 
                Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
                Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
                House of Representatives not later than 15 days before 
                making the determination; and
                    (C) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  the eligibility for flood 
                insurance coverage at a risk premium rate determined 
                under this subsection terminates no later than 1 year 
                after the date on which the Administrator makes the 
                determination.
            (2) Limitation.--Upon termination of eligibility under 
        paragraph (1)(C), a community may submit another request 
        pursuant to paragraph (1)(A). The Administrator may make no more 
        than two determinations under paragraph (1) with respect to 
        persons residing within any single requesting community.
            (3) Termination.--The authority provided under paragraphs 
        (1) and (2) shall terminate two years after the enactment of 
        this Act.
SEC. 100231. STUDIES AND REPORTS.

    (a) Report on Improving the National Flood Insurance Program.--Not 
later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study and 
submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives, on--
            (1) the number of flood insurance policy holders currently 
        insuring--
                    (A) a residential structure up to the maximum 
                available coverage amount, as established in section 
                61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, of--
                          (i) $250,000 for the structure; and
                          (ii) $100,000 for the contents of such 
                      structure; or
                    (B) a commercial structure up to the maximum 
                available coverage amount, as established in section 
                61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, of 
                $500,000;
            (2) the increased losses the National Flood Insurance 
        Program would have sustained during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane

[[Page 126 STAT. 950]]

        season if the National Flood Insurance Program had insured all 
        policyholders up to the maximum conforming loan limit for fiscal 
        year 2006 of $417,000, as established under section 302(b)(2) of 
        the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 
        1717(b)(2));
            (3) the availability in the private marketplace of flood 
        insurance coverage in amounts that exceed the current limits of 
        coverage amounts established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code 
        of Federal Regulations; and
            (4) what effect, if any--
                    (A) raising the current limits of coverage amounts 
                established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal 
                Regulations, would have on the ability of private 
                insurers to continue providing flood insurance coverage; 
                and
                    (B) reducing the current limits of coverage amounts 
                established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal 
                Regulations, would have on the ability of private 
                insurers to provide sufficient flood insurance coverage 
                to effectively replace the current level of flood 
                insurance coverage being provided under the National 
                Flood Insurance Program.

        Program; and
            (2) <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>>  not later than 18 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, submit a report on the 
        findings of such review to the Administrator, the Committee on 
        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, and the 
        Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.

    (e) Study and Report on Graduated Risk.--
            (1) Study.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Contracts.>>  Study required.--The 
                Administrator shall enter into a contract under which 
                the National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study 
                exploring methods for understanding graduated risk 
                behind levees and the associated land development, 
                insurance, and risk communication dimensions.
                    (B) Contents of study.--The study under this 
                paragraph shall--
                          (i) research, review, and recommend current 
                      best practices for estimating direct annualized 
                      flood losses behind levees for residential and 
                      commercial structures;
                          (ii) rank each best practice recommended under 
                      clause (i) based on the best value, balancing 
                      cost, scientific integrity, and the inherent 
                      uncertainties associated with all aspects of the 
                      loss estimate, including geotechnical engineering, 
                      flood frequency estimates, economic value, and 
                      direct damages;
                          (iii) research, review, and identify current 
                      best floodplain management and land use practices 
                      behind levees that effectively balance social, 
                      economic, and environmental considerations as part 
                      of an overall flood risk management strategy;
                          (iv) identify areas in which the best 
                      floodplain management and land use practices 
                      described in clause (iii) have proven effective 
                      and recommend methods and processes by which such 
                      practices could be applied more broadly across the 
                      United States, given the variety of different 
                      flood risks, State and local legal frameworks, and 
                      evolving judicial opinions;
                          (v) research, review, and identify a variety 
                      of flood insurance pricing options for flood 
                      hazards behind levees that are actuarially sound 
                      and based on the flood risk data developed using 
                      the 3 best practices recommended under clause (i) 
                      that have the best value as determined under 
                      clause (ii);
                          (vi) evaluate and recommend methods to reduce 
                      insurance costs through creative arrangements 
                      between insureds and insurers while keeping a 
                      clear accounting of how much financial risk is 
                      being borne by various parties such that the 
                      entire risk is accounted for, including 
                      establishment of explicit limits on disaster aid 
                      or other assistance in the event of a flood; and
                          (vii) taking into consideration the 
                      recommendations under clauses (i) through (iii), 
                      recommend approaches to communicate the associated 
                      risks to

[[Page 126 STAT. 953]]

                      community officials, homeowners, and other 
                      residents of communities.
            (2) Report.--The contract under paragraph (1)(A) shall 
        provide that not later than 12 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the National Academy of Sciences shall 
        submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
        of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services and the 
        Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of 
        Representatives a report on the study under paragraph (1) that 
        includes the information and recommendations required under 
        paragraph (1).

    (a) FEMA and GAO Reports on Privatization.--Not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall each--
            (1) <<NOTE: Study.>>  conduct a separate study to assess a 
        broad range of options, methods, and strategies for privatizing 
        the National Flood Insurance Program; and

        Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate with recommendations 
        for the best manner to accomplish the privatization described in 
        paragraph (1).

    (b) Private Risk-management Initiatives.--The Administrator may 
carry out such private risk-management initiatives as are otherwise 
authorized under applicable law, as the Administrator considers 
appropriate to determine the capacity of private insurers, reinsurers, 
and financial markets to assist communities, on a voluntary basis only, 
in managing the full range of financial risks associated with flooding.
    (c) Reinsurance Assessment.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>>  Private market pricing 
        assessment.--Not later than 12 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to 
        Congress a report that--
                    (A) assesses the capacity of the private 
                reinsurance, capital, and financial markets to assist 
                communities, on a voluntary basis, in managing the full 
                range of financial risks associated with flooding by 
                requesting proposals to assume a portion of the 
                insurance risk of the National Flood Insurance Program;
                    (B) describes any responses to the request for 
                proposals under subparagraph (A);
                    (C) assesses whether the rates and terms contained 
                in any proposals received by the Administrator are--
                          (i) reasonable and appropriate; and
                          (ii) in an amount sufficient to maintain the 
                      ability of the National Flood Insurance Program to 
                      pay claims;
                    (D) describes the extent to which carrying out the 
                proposals received by the Administrator would minimize 
                the likelihood that the Administrator would use the 
                borrowing authority under section 1309 of the National

SEC. 100240. LEVEES CONSTRUCTED ON CERTAIN PROPERTIES.

    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``covered hazard 
mitigation land'' means land that--
            (1) was acquired and deed restricted under section 1366 of 
        the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4104c) 
        during the period beginning on January 1, 1999, and ending 
        December 31, 2011;
            (2) is located at--
                    (A) 1029 Oak Street, Fargo, North Dakota;
                    (B) 27 South Terrace, Fargo, North Dakota;
                    (C) 1033 Oak Street, Fargo, North Dakota;
                    (D) 308 Schnell Drive, Oxbow, North Dakota; or
                    (E) 306 Schnell Drive, Oxbow, North Dakota; and
            (3) is located in a community that--
                    (A) is participating in the National Flood Insurance 
                Program on the date on which a State, local, or tribal 
                government submits an application requesting to 
                construct a permanent flood risk reduction levee under 
                subsection (b); and
                    (B) <<NOTE: Certification.>>  certifies to the 
                Administrator and the Chief of Engineers that the 
                community will continue to participate in the National 
                Flood Insurance Program.

    (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other prohibition on 
construction on property acquired with funding from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for conversion to open space purposes, the 
Administrator shall allow the construction of a permanent flood risk 
reduction levee by a State, local, or tribal government on covered 
hazard mitigation land if--
            (1) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  the Administrator and the 
        Chief of Engineers make a determination that--
                    (A) construction of the proposed permanent flood 
                risk reduction levee would more effectively mitigate 
                against flooding risk than an open floodplain or other 
                flood risk reduction measures;
                    (B) the proposed permanent flood risk reduction 
                levee complies with Federal, State, and local 
                requirements, including mitigation of adverse impacts 
                and implementation of floodplain management 
                requirements, which shall include an evaluation of 
                whether the construction, operation, and maintenance of 
                the proposed levee--
                          (i) would continue to meet best available 
                      industry standards and practices;
                          (ii) would be the most cost-effective measure 
                      to protect against the assessed flood risk; and
                          (iii) minimizes future costs to the Federal 
                      Government;
                    (C) the State, local, or tribal government seeking 
                to construct the proposed permanent flood risk reduction 
                levee has provided an adequate maintenance plan that 
                documents the procedures the State, local, or tribal 
                government will use to ensure that the stability, 
                height, and overall integrity of the proposed levee and 
                the structure and systems of the proposed levee are 
                maintained, including--
                          (i) specifying the maintenance activities to 
                      be performed;
                          (ii) specifying the frequency with which 
                      maintenance activities will be performed;

[[Page 126 STAT. 962]]

                          (iii) specifying the person responsible for 
                      performing each maintenance activity (by name or 
                      title);
                          (iv) detailing the plan for financing the 
                      maintenance of the levee; and
                          (v) documenting the ability of the State, 
                      local, or tribal government to finance the 
                      maintenance of the levee; and
            (2) before the commencement of construction, the State, 
        local, or tribal government provides to the Administrator an 
        amount--
                    (A) equal to the Federal share of all project costs 
                previously provided by the Administrator under the 
                applicable program for each deed restricted parcel of 
                the covered hazard mitigation land, which the 
                Administrator shall deposit in the National Flood 
                Insurance Fund; and
                    (B) that does not include any Federal funds.

    (c) Maintenance Certification.--
            (1) In general.--A State, local, or tribal government that 
        constructs a permanent flood risk reduction levee under 
        subsection (b) shall submit to the Administrator and the Chief 
        of Engineers an annual certification indicating whether the 
        State, local, or tribal government is in compliance with the 
        maintenance plan provided under subsection (b)(1)(C).
            (2) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Review.--The Chief of 
        Engineers shall review each certification submitted under 
        paragraph (1) and determine whether the State, local, or tribal 
        government has complied with the maintenance plan.

                    (A) construction of the proposed flood protection 
                improvement would more effectively mitigate against 
                flooding risk than an open floodplain or other flood 
                risk reduction measures;
                    (B) the proposed flood protection improvement 
                complies with Federal, State, and local requirements,

                      industry standards and practices;
                          (ii) would be the most cost-effective measure 
                      to protect against the assessed flood risk; and
                          (iii) minimizes future costs to the Federal 
                      Government;
                    (C) the State, local, or tribal government seeking

                the covered hazard mitigation land, which the 
                Administrator shall deposit in the National Flood 
                Insurance Fund; and
