SEC. 101. <<NOTE: 22 USC 8711.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENFORCEMENT 
                        OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME AND 
                        EXPANSION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS 
                        LAWS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling Iran to 
abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other 
threatening activities can be effectively achieved through a 
comprehensive policy that includes economic sanctions, diplomacy,

[[Page 126 STAT. 1217]]

 and military planning, capabilities and options, and that this 
objective is consistent with the one stated by President Barack Obama in 
the 2012 State of the Union Address: ``Let there be no doubt: America is 
determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will 
take no options off the table to achieve that goal''. Among the economic 
measures to be taken are--
            (1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral sanctions 
        regime with respect to Iran;
            (2) full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all 
        sanctions enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or 
        expanded by this Act or amendments made by this Act, through--
                    (A) intensified monitoring by the President and the 
                designees of the President, including the Secretary of 
                the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and senior 
                officials in the intelligence community (as defined in 
                section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50

                provided for under the International Emergency Economic 
                Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and other sanctions 
                laws;
                    (C) reallocation of resources to provide the 
                personnel necessary, within the Department of the 
                Treasury, the Department of State, and the Department of 
                Commerce, and, where appropriate, the intelligence 
                community, to apply and enforce sanctions; and
                    (D) expanded cooperation with international 
                sanctions enforcement efforts;
            (3) urgent consideration of the expansion of existing 
        sanctions with respect to such areas as--
                    (A) the provision of energy-related services to 
                Iran;
                    (B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance 
                services to Iran;
                    (C) the provision of shipping services to Iran; and
                    (D) those Iranian financial institutions not yet 
                designated for the imposition of sanctions that may be 
                acting as intermediaries for Iranian financial 
                institutions that are designated for the imposition of 
                sanctions; and
            (4) a focus on countering Iran's efforts to evade sanctions, 
        including--
                    (A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, 
                and satellite service providers, in and outside of Iran, 
                to ensure that such providers are not participating in 
                or facilitating, directly or indirectly, the evasion of 
                the sanctions regime with respect to Iran or violations 
                of the human rights of the people of Iran;
                    (B) the activities of financial institutions or 
                other businesses or government agencies, in or outside 
                of Iran, not yet designated for the imposition of 
                sanctions; and
                    (C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran's energy, 
                national security, financial, and telecommunications 
                sectors, to gauge the effects of, and possible defects 
                in, particular sanctions, with prompt efforts to correct 
                any gaps in the existing sanctions regime with respect 
                to Iran.

                      Shipping Lines from landing at seaports, and cargo 
                      flights of Iran Air from landing at airports, in 
                      that country because of the role of those

        intermediary financial institution with access to such messaging 
        services.

                regime, terminated the knowing provision of such 
                messaging services to, and the knowing enabling and 
                facilitation of direct or indirect access to such 
                messaging services for, the Central Bank of Iran and

        the commission of serious human rights abuses against citizens 
        of Iran or their family members on or after June 12, 2009, 
        regardless of whether such abuses occurred in Iran. For any such 
        person who is not included in such report, the Secretary of 
        State should describe in the report the reasons why the person 
        was not included, including information on whether sufficient 
        credible evidence of responsibility for such abuses was found.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified 
        annex.
