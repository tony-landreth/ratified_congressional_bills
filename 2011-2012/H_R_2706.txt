112th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To prohibit the sale of billfish. <<NOTE: Oct. 5, 2012 -  [H.R. 2706]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Billfish 
Conservation Act of 2012. 16 USC 1801 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Billfish Conservation Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1827a note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States carefully regulates its domestic 
        fisheries for billfish and participates in international fishery 
        management bodies in the Atlantic and Pacific.
            (2) Global billfish populations have declined significantly, 
        however, because of overfishing primarily through retention of 
        bycatch by non-United States commercial fishing fleets.
            (3) Ending the importation of foreign-caught billfish for 
        sale in the United States aligns with U.S. management measures 
        of billfish and protects the significant economic benefits to 
        the U.S. economy of recreational fishing and marine commerce and 
        the traditional cultural fisheries.
