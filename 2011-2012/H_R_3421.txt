SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the tragic deaths at the World Trade Center, at the 
        Pentagon, and in rural Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, have 
        forever changed our Nation;
            (2) the officers, emergency workers, and other employees of 
        State and local government agencies, including the Port 
        Authority of New York and New Jersey, and of the United States 
        government and others, who responded to the attacks on the World 
        Trade Center in New York City and perished as a result of the 
        tragic events of September 11, 2001 (including those who are 
        missing and presumed dead), took heroic and noble action on that 
        day;
            (3) the officers, emergency rescue workers, and employees of 
        local and United States government agencies, who responded to 
        the attack on the Pentagon in Washington, DC, took heroic and 
        noble action to evacuate the premises and prevent further 
        casualties of Pentagon employees;
            (4) the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, 
        recognizing the imminent danger that the aircraft that they were 
        aboard posed to large numbers of innocent men, women and 
        children, American institutions, and the symbols of American 
        democracy, took heroic and noble action to ensure that the 
        aircraft could not be used as a weapon; and
            (5) given the unprecedented nature of the attacks against 
        the United States of America and the need to properly 
        demonstrate the support of the country for those who lost their 
        lives to terrorism, it is fitting that their sacrifice be 
        recognized with the award of an appropriate medal.
