Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
        Museum opened in Cooperstown, New York. Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, 
        Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner comprised the 
        inaugural class of inductees. This class set the standard for 
        all future inductees. Since 1939, just one percent of all Major 
        League Baseball players have earned induction into the National 
        Baseball Hall of Fame.
            (2) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is 
        dedicated to preserving history, honoring excellence, and 
        connecting generations through the rich history of our national 
        pastime. Baseball has mirrored our Nation's history since the 
        Civil War, and is now an integral part of our Nation's heritage.
            (3) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum chronicles 
        the history of our national pastime and houses the world's 
        largest collection of baseball artifacts, including more than 
        38,000 three dimensional artifacts, 3,000,000 documents, 500,000 
        photographs, and 12,000 hours of recorded media. This collection 
        ensures that baseball history and its unique connection to 
        American history will be preserved and recounted for future 
        generations.
            (4) Since its opening in 1939, more than 14,000,000 baseball 
        fans have visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 
        to learn about the history of our national pastime and the 
        game's connection to the American experience.
            (5) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an 
        educational institution, reaching 10,000,000 Americans annually. 
        Utilizing video conference technology, students and teachers 
        participate in interactive lessons led by educators from the 
        National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum. These award-winning 
        educational programs draw upon the wonders of baseball to reach 
        students in classrooms nationwide. Each educational program uses 
        baseball as a lens for teaching young Americans important 
        lessons on an array of topics, including

[[Page 126 STAT. 1156]]

        mathematics, geography, civil rights, women's history, 
        economics, industrial technology, arts, and communication.
SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.

    (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame, the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this 
Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue the following 
coins:
            (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which 
        shall--
                    (A) weigh 8.359 grams;
                    (B) have diameter of 0.850 inches; and
                    (C) contain 90 percent gold and 10 percent alloy.
            (2) $1 silver coins.--Not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which 
        shall--
                    (A) weigh 26.73 grams;
                    (B) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and
                    (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.
            (3) Half-dollar clad coins.--Not more than 750,000 half-
        dollar coins which shall--
                    (A) weigh 11.34 grams;
                    (B) have a diameter of 1.205 inches; and
                    (C) be minted to the specifications for half-dollar 
                coins contained in section 5112(b) of title 31, United 
                States Code.

    (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be legal 
tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United States Code.

title 31, United States Code, all coins minted under this Act shall be 
considered to be numismatic items.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to the 
extent possible without significantly adding to the purchase price of 
the coins, the $1 coins and $5 coins minted under this Act should be 
produced in a fashion similar to the 2009 International Year of 
Astronomy coins issued by Monnaie de Paris, the French Mint, so that the 
reverse of the coin is convex to more closely resemble a baseball and 
the obverse concave, providing a more dramatic display of the obverse 
design chosen pursuant to section 4(c).

                    (B) the Commission of Fine Arts; and
            (2) reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory 
        Committee.

    (b) Designations and Inscriptions.--On each coin minted under this 
Act there shall be--
            (1) a designation of the value of the coin;

        coins minted under this Act may be submitted in accordance with 
        the design selection and approval process developed by the
