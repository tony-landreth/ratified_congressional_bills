                liquidity for small and middle capitalization company 
                securities and whether there is sufficient economic 
                incentive to support trading operations in these 
                securities in penny increments. Not later than 90 days 
                after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the 
                Commission shall submit to Congress a report on the

    (a) In General.--With respect to an exemption provided to emerging 
growth companies under this title, or an amendment made by this title, 
an emerging growth company may choose to

[[Page 126 STAT. 313]]

forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply 
to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company.
    (b) Special Rule.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to 
the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting 
standards provided under section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 
1933 and section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added 
by section 102(b), if an emerging growth company chooses to comply with 
such standards to the same extent that a non-emerging growth company is 
required to comply with such standards, the emerging growth company--
            (1) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  must make such choice at the 
        time the company is first required to file a registration 
        statement, periodic report, or other report with the Commission 
        under section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 
        notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of such choice;
            (2) may not select some standards to comply with in such 
        manner and not others, but must comply with all such standards 
        to the same extent that a non-emerging growth company is 
        required to comply with such standards; and
            (3) must continue to comply with such standards to the same 
        extent that a non-emerging growth company is required to comply 
        with such standards for as long as the company remains an 
        emerging growth company.
SEC. 108. REVIEW OF REGULATION S-K.

    (a) Review.--The Securities and Exchange Commission shall conduct a 
review of its Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.10 et seq.) to--
            (1) comprehensively analyze the current registration 
        requirements of such regulation; and
            (2) determine how such requirements can be updated to 
        modernize and simplify the registration process and reduce the 
        costs and other burdens associated with these requirements for 
        issuers who are emerging growth companies.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this title, the Commission shall transmit to Congress a report of the 
review conducted under subsection (a). The report shall include the 
specific recommendations of the Commission on how to streamline the 
registration process in order to make it more efficient and less 
burdensome for the Commission and for prospective issuers who are 
emerging growth companies.

        date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission shall revise its rules issued in section 230.506 of 
        title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to provide that the 
        prohibition against general solicitation or general advertising 
        contained in section 230.502(c) of such title shall not apply to 
        offers and sales of securities made pursuant to section 230.506,

        investors. Such rules shall require the issuer to take 
        reasonable steps to verify

[[Page 126 STAT. 314]]

        that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors, 
        using such methods as determined by the Commission. Section 
        230.506 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised 
        pursuant to this section, shall continue to be treated as a 
        regulation issued under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of

            (2) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise 
        subsection (d)(1) of section 230.144A of title 17, Code of 
        Federal Regulations, to provide that securities sold under such 
        revised exemption may be offered to persons other than qualified 
        institutional buyers, including by means of general solicitation 
        or general advertising, provided that securities are sold only 
        to persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of 
        the seller reasonably believe is a qualified institutional 
        buyer.

    (b) Consistency in Interpretation.--Section 4 of the Securities Act 
of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``The provisions of section 5'' and 
        inserting ``(a) The provisions of section 5''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

advertising or general solicitation.''.

        inserting ``(a) The provisions of section 5''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

                solicitations, general advertisements, or similar or 
                related activities by issuers of such securities, 
                whether online, in person, or through any other means;
                    ``(B) that person or any person associated with that

        with the offer, sale, purchase, or negotiation of such security, 
        so long as such services do not include, for separate 
        compensation, investment advice or recommendations to issuers or
