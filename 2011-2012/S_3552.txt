  (1) <<NOTE: Extension.>> A decision review time that would otherwise 
end on a Satur- day, Sunday, or 
federal holiday, will be extended to end on the next business day.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1333]]

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica- 
tion must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the 
category covers a maximum of five new products. Each ap- plication for 
an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is 
submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food 
use application package is subject to the reg- istration service fee for 
a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications 
that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient 
or first food use decision re- view time. In the case of a new active 
ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, 
any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the 
registration service fee and decision review time for a new active 
ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that 
first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of 
the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first 
food use application.
  (3) <<NOTE: Labeling. Deadlines.>> Where the action involves approval 
of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision 
review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted 
label, includ- ing any changes made by the Agency that differ from the 
applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the 
Agency. The <<NOTE: Notification.>> applicant will notify the Agency 
that the applicant ei- ther (a) agrees to all of the terms associated 
with the draft accept- ed label as amended by the Agency and requests 
that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; 
or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted 
label as amended by the Agency and requests additional time to resolve 
the dif- ference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without prejudice 
for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration 
service fee. For cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 
30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms 
of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the 
terms of the accepted label as in (a), including upon reso- lution of 
differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the 
registrant's written or electronic confirmation of agreement to the 
Agency.

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the

any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the

first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of

Agency.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1338]]

  (4) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered 
product labels are covered by the base fee for the new use(s). All 
items in the covered application must be submitted together in one 
package. Each application for an additional new product registra- 
tion and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new use ap- 
plication package is subject to the registration service fee for a new 
product or a new inert approval. However, if a new use application only 
proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no 
amendments in the application, then review of one new product 
application is covered by the new use fee. All such associ- 
ated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the 
new use decision review time. Any application for a new product or an 
amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to 
submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its 
decision review time and (c) containing the same new uses, will be 
deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a sepa- 
rate registration service fee and new decision review time for a new 
use. If the new-use application includes non-food (indoor and/or 
outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is 
due for each type of new use and the longest decision review time 
applies to all of the new uses requested in the application. 
Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the 
Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's ini- 
tiative to support the application after completion of the technical 
deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration applica- 
tion, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the 
new use application.

  (1) <<NOTE: Extension.>> A decision review time that would otherwise 
end on a Satur- day, Sunday, or 
federal holiday, will be extended to end on the next business day.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1341]]

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica- 
tion must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the 
category covers a maximum of five new products. Each ap- plication for 
an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is 
submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food 
use application package is subject to the reg- istration service fee for 
a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications 
that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient 
or first food use decision re- view time. In the case of a new active 
ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, 
any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the 
registration service fee and decision review time for a new active 
ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that 
first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of 
the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first 
food use application.
  (3) <<NOTE: Labeling. Deadlines.>> Where the action involves approval 
of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision 
review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted 
label, includ- ing any changes made by the Agency that differ from the 
applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the 
Agency. The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant ei- ther 
(a) agrees to all of the terms associated with the draft accept- ed 
label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued 
as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; or (b) does not agree to 
one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the 
Agency and requests additional time to resolve the dif- ference(s); or 
(c) withdraws the application without prejudice for subsequent 
resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For 
cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days 
to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms of the Agency-
accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the 
accepted label as in (a), including upon reso- lution of differences in 
(b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-stamped label to 
the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written 
or electronic confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica- 
tion must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the 
category covers a maximum of five new products. Each ap- plication for 
an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is 
submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food 
use application package is subject to the reg- istration service fee for 
a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications 
that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient 
or first food use decision re- view time. In the case of a new active 
ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, 
any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the 
registration service fee and decision review time for a new active 
ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that 
first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of 
the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first 
food use application.

(c) withdraws the application without prejudice for subsequent 
resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For

accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the

  (1) <<NOTE: Extension.>> A decision review time that would otherwise 
end on a Satur- day, Sunday, or 
federal holiday, will be extended to end on the next business day.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1356]]

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica- 
tion must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the 
category covers a maximum of five new products. Each ap- plication for 
an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is 
submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food 
use application package is subject to the reg- istration service fee for 
a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications 
that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient 
or first food use decision re- view time. In the case of a new active 
ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, 
any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the 
registration service fee and decision review time for a new active 
ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that 
first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of 
the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first 
food use application.
  (3) <<NOTE: Time period.>> If EPA data rules are amended to newly 
require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of an 
anti- microbial product where such ingredient was not previously subject 
to such a clearance, then review of the data for such clearance of such 
product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance 
action for two years from the effective date of the rule.

  (4) <<NOTE: Labeling. Deadlines.>> Where the action involves approval 
of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision 
review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted 
label, includ- ing any changes made by the Agency that differ from the 
applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the 
Agency. The <<NOTE: Notification.>> applicant will notify the Agency 
that the applicant ei- ther (a) agrees to all of the terms associated 
with the draft accept- ed label as amended by the Agency and requests 
that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; 
or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted 
label as amended by the Agency and requests additional time to resolve 
the dif- ference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without prejudice 
for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration 
service fee. For cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 
30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms 
of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the 
terms of the accepted label as in (a), including upon reso- lution of 
differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the 
registrant's written or electronic confirmation of agreement to the 
Agency.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1357]]

  (5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered 
product labels are covered by the base fee for the new use(s). All 
items in the covered application must be submitted together in one 
package. Each application for an additional new product registra- 
tion and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new use ap- 
plication package is subject to the registration service fee for a new 
product or a new inert approval. However, if a new use application only 
proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no 
amendments in the application, then review of one new product 
application is covered by the new use fee. All such associ- 
ated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the 
new use decision review time. Any application for a new product or an 
amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to 
submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its 
decision review time and (c) containing the same new uses, will be 
deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a sepa- 
rate registration service fee and new decision review time for a new 
use. If the new-use application includes non-food (indoor and/or 
outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is 
due for each type of new use and the longest decision review time 
applies to all of the new uses requested in the application. 
Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the 
Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's ini- 
tiative to support the application after completion of the technical 
deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration applica- 
tion, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the 
new use application.

subject to the new inert approval decision review time. In the case of a 
new active in- gredient application, until that new active ingredient is 
approved, any subsequent application for another new product 
containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed 
labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject 
to the registration service fee and decision review time for a new 
active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until 
that first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an addi- 
tional new food use or uses will be subject to the registration serv- 
ice fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any informa- 
tion that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) 
is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's initiative to support 
the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, 
and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be 
assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the new active

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica-

ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, 
any subsequent application for another new product containing the same 
active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed labeling will be 
deemed a new ac- tive ingredient application, subject to the 
registration service fee and decision review time for a new active 
ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that 
first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional 
new food use or uses will be subject to the registration service fee and 
decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was 
neither re- quested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by 
the ap- plicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application 
after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is 
not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of 
the full registration service fee for the new active ingredient or first 
food use application.
  (3) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered 
product labels are covered by the base fee for the new use(s). All 
items in the covered application must be submitted together in one 
package. Each application for an additional new product registra- 
tion and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new use ap- 
plication package is subject to the registration service fee for a new 
product or a new inert approval. However, if a new use application only 
proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no 
amendments in the application, then review of one new product 
application is covered by the new use fee. All such associ- 
ated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the 
new use decision review time. Any application for a new product or an 
amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to 
submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its 
decision review time and (c) containing the same new uses, will be 
deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a sepa- 
rate registration service fee and new decision review time for a new 
use. If the new-use application includes non-food (indoor and/or 
outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is 
due for each type of new use and the longest decision review time 
applies to all of the new uses requested in the application. 
Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the 
Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's ini- 
tiative to support the application after completion of the technical 
deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration applica- 
tion, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the 
new use application.

  (1) <<NOTE: Extension.>> A decision review time that would otherwise 
end on a Satur- day, Sunday, or 
federal holiday, will be extended to end on the next business day.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1385]]

  (2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in 
any application for a new active ingredient or a first food use are 
covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food 
use application and retain the same decision time review period as the 
new active ingredient or first food use application. The applica- 
tion must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the 
category covers a maximum of five new products. Each ap- plication for 
an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is 
submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food 
use application package is subject to the reg- istration service fee for 
a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications 
that are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient 
or first food use decision re- view time, except where the new inert 
approval decision review time is greater than that for the new active 
ingredient, in which case the associated new active ingredient will be 
subject to the new inert approval decision review time. In the case of a 
new active in- gredient application, until that new active ingredient is 
approved, any subsequent application for another new product 
containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed 
labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject 
to the registration service fee and decision review time for a new 
active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until 
that first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an addi- 
tional new food use or uses will be subject to the registration serv- 
ice fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any informa- 
tion that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) 
is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's initiative to support 
the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, 
and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be 
assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the new active 
ingredient or first food use application.
  (3) An application for a new end-use product using a source of ac- 
tive ingredient that (a) is not yet registered but (b) has an applica- 
tion pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an ap- 
plication for a new product with an unregistered source of active 
ingredient.
  (4) (a) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged registra- tion 
service fees. (b) Registrant-initiated fast-track amendments are to be 
completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B) and 
are not subject to registration service fees. (c) Registrant-initiated 
fast-track amendments handled by the Antimicrobials Division are to be 
completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(h) and are 
not subject to registration service fees. (d) Registrant initiated 
amendments submitted by no- tification under PR Notices, such as PR 
Notice 98-10, continue under PR Notice timelines and are not subject to 
registration serv- ice fees. (e) Submissions with data and requiring 
data review are subject to registration service fees.

[[Page 126 STAT. 1386]]

  (5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered 
product labels are covered by the base fee for the new use(s). All 
items in the covered application must be submitted together in one 
package. Each application for an additional new product registra- 
tion and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new use ap- 
plication package is subject to the registration service fee for a new 
product or a new inert approval. However, if a new use application only 
proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no 
amendments in the application, then review of one new product 
application is covered by the new use fee. All such associ- 
ated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the 
new use decision review time. Any application for a new product or an 
amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to 
submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its 
decision review time and (c) containing the same new uses, will be 
deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a sepa- 
rate registration service fee and new decision review time for a new 
use. If the new-use application includes non-food (indoor and/or 
outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is 
due for each type of new use and the longest decision review time 
applies to all of the new uses requested in the application. 
Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the 
Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's ini- 
tiative to support the application after completion of the technical 
deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration applica- 
tion, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the 
new use application.

  (1) <<NOTE: Extension.>> A decision review time that would otherwise 
end on a Satur- day, Sunday, or 
federal holiday, will be extended to end on the next business day.

  (2) New PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that has not been 
registered.
  (3) Registered PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that is cur- 
rently registered.
  (4) Transfer registered PIP through conventional breeding for new 
food/feed use, such as from field corn to sweet corn.
  (5) The scientific data involved in this category are complex. EPA 
often seeks technical advice from the Scientific Advisory Panel on 
risks that pesticides pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide appli- 
cators, non-target species, as well as insect resistance, and novel 
scientific issues surrounding new technologies. The scientists of the 
SAP neither make nor recommend policy decisions. They provide advice on 
the science used to make these decisions. Their advice is invaluable to 
the EPA as it strives to protect humans and the envi- ronment from risks 
posed by pesticides. Due to the time it takes to schedule and prepare 
for meetings with the SAP, additional time and costs are needed.
  (6) Registered PIPs stacked through conventional breeding.
  (7) Deployment of a registered PIP with a different IRM plan (e.g., 
seed blend).
  (8) The negotiated acreage cap will depend upon EPA's deter- mination 
of the potential environmental exposure, risk(s) to non- target 
organisms, and the risk of targeted pest developing resist- ance to the 
pesticidal substance. The uncertainty of these risks may reduce the 
allowable acreage, based upon the quantity and type of non-target 
organism data submitted and the lack of insect resistance management 
data, which is usually not required for seed-increase registrations. 
Registrants are encouraged to consult with EPA prior to submission of a 
registration application in this category.
  (9) Application can be submitted prior to or concurrently with an 
application for commercial registration.
  (10) For example, IRM plan modifications that are applicant-ini- 
tiated.
  (11) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged fees.

ent upon a pending application for an inert ingredient action, each 
application will be subject to its respective registration service fee. 
The decision review time for the other associated covered applica- tion 
will be extended to match the PRIA due date of the pending 
inert ingredient action, unless the PRIA due date for the other as- 
sociated covered action is further out, in which case it will be sub- 
ject to its own decision review time. If the application covers multiple 
ingredients grouped by EPA into one chemical class, a single 
registration service fee will be assessed for approval of those ingre- 
dients.
  (3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under 
section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of an antimicrobial product 
where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, 
then review of the data for such clearance of such product is not 
subject to a registration service fee for the tol- erance action for two 
years from the effective date of the rule.

that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; 
or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted 
label as amended by the Agency and requests additional time to resolve 
the dif- ference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without prejudice 
for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration 
service fee. For cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 
30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms 
of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the 
terms of the accepted label as in (a), including upon reso- lution of
