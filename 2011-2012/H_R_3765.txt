                  TITLE IV--MORTGAGE FEES AND PREMIUMS

SEC. 401. GUARANTEE FEES.

    Subpart A of part 2 of subtitle A of title XIII of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1992 is amended by adding after section 
1326 (12 U.S.C. 4546) the following new section:
``SEC. 1327. <<NOTE: 12 USC 4547.>>  ENTERPRISE GUARANTEE FEES.

    ``(a) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  Definitions.--For purposes of this 
section, the following definitions shall apply:
            ``(1) Guarantee fee.--The term `guarantee fee'--
                    ``(A) means a fee described in subsection (b); and
                    ``(B) includes--
                          ``(i) the guaranty fee charged by the Federal 
                      National Mortgage Association with respect to 
                      mortgage-backed securities; and
                          ``(ii) the management and guarantee fee 
                      charged by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
                      Corporation with respect to participation 
                      certificates.
            ``(2) Average fees.--The term `average fees' means the 
        average contractual fee rate of single-family guaranty 
        arrangements by an enterprise entered into during 2011, plus the 
        recognition of any up-front cash payments over an estimated 
        average life, expressed in terms of basis points. Such 
        definition shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the 
        annual report on guarantee fees by the Federal Housing Finance 
        Agency.

    ``(b) Increase.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Phased increase required.--Subject to 
                subsection (c), the Director shall require each 
                enterprise to charge a guarantee fee in connection with 
                any guarantee of the timely payment of principal and 
                interest on securities, notes, and other obligations 
                based on or backed by mortgages on residential real 
                properties designed principally for occupancy of from 1 
                to 4 families, consummated after the date of enactment 
                of this section.
                    ``(B) Amount.--The amount of the increase required 
                under this section shall be determined by the Director 
                to appropriately reflect the risk of loss, as well the 
                cost of capital allocated to similar assets held by 
                other fully private regulated financial institutions, 
                but such amount shall be not less than an average 
                increase of 10 basis points for each origination year or 
                book year above the average fees imposed in 2011 for 
                such guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an 
                enterprise from offsetting the cost of the fee to 
                mortgage originators, borrowers, and investors by 
                decreasing other charges, fees, or premiums, or in any 
                other manner.
            ``(2) Authority to limit offer of guarantee.--The Director 
        shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating any offer for a 
        guarantee to a lender for mortgage-backed securities, if--
                    ``(A) the guarantee is inconsistent with the 
                requirements of this section; or

                    ``(B) the risk of loss is allowed to increase, 
                through lowering of the underwriting standards or other 
                means, for the primary purpose of meeting the 
                requirements of this section.
            ``(3) Deposit in treasury.--Amounts received from fee 
        increases imposed under this section shall be deposited directly 
        into the United States Treasury, and shall be available only to 
        the extent provided in subsequent appropriations Acts. The fees 
        charged pursuant to this section shall not be considered a 
        reimbursement to the Federal Government for the costs or subsidy 
        provided to an enterprise.

    ``(c) Phase-in.--
            ``(1) <<NOTE: Time period.>>  In general.--The Director may 
        provide for compliance with subsection (b) by allowing each 
        enterprise to increase the guarantee fee charged by the 
        enterprise gradually over the 2-year period beginning on the 
        date of enactment of this section, in a manner sufficient to 
        comply with this section. In determining a schedule for such 
        increases, the Director shall--
                    ``(A) provide for uniform pricing among lenders;
                    ``(B) provide for adjustments in pricing based on 
                risk levels; and
                    ``(C) take into consideration conditions in 
                financial markets.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be interpreted to undermine the minimum increase required 
        by subsection (b).

    ``(d) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  Information Collection and Annual 
Analysis.--The Director shall require each enterprise to provide to the 
Director, as part of its annual report submitted to Congress--
            ``(1) a description of--
                    ``(A) changes made to up-front fees and annual fees 
                as part of the guarantee fees negotiated with lenders;
                    ``(B) changes to the riskiness of the new borrowers 
                compared to previous origination years or book years; 
                and
                    ``(C) any adjustments required to improve for future 
                origination years or book years, in order to be in

            ``(2) an assessment of how the changes in the guarantee fees 
        described in paragraph (1) met the requirements of subsection 
        (b).

    ``(e) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) Required adjustments.--Based on the information from 
        subsection (d) and any other information the Director deems 
        necessary, the Director shall require an enterprise to make 
        adjustments in its guarantee fee in order to be in compliance 
        with subsection (b).
            ``(2) Noncompliance penalty.--An enterprise that has been 
        found to be out of compliance with subsection (b) for any 2 
        consecutive years shall be precluded from providing any 
        guarantee for a period, determined by rule of the Director, but 
        in no case less than 1 year.
            ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be interpreted as preventing the Director from initiating 
        and implementing an enforcement action against an enterprise, at 
        a time the Director deems necessary, under other existing 
        enforcement authority.

        collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account 
        delinquent payments or prepayments).

        Secretary, until the number of basis points of the annual

        of paragraph (1), a provision shall be considered an emergency 
        designation if it designates any item pursuant to section 
        251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985.
            ``(4) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under 
        paragraph (1) may be raised by a Senator as provided in section 
        313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
            ``(5) Conference reports.--When the Senate is considering a 
        conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
        relation to, a bill, upon a point of order being made by any 
        Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order being 
        sustained, such material contained in such conference report 
        shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to 
        consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from 
        its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur in 
        the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may 
        be, which further amendment shall consist of only that portion 
        of the conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, 
        not so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be 
        debatable. In any case in which such point of order is sustained 
        against a conference report (or Senate amendment derived from 
        such conference report by operation of this subsection), no 
        further amendment shall be in order.''.
