        international airports that are not included in ticket prices.

    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on

                otherwise eligible for construction assistance under

[[Page 126 STAT. 27]]

SEC. 140. MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

    (a) <<NOTE: 49 USC 47113 note.>> Findings.--Congress finds the 
following:
            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination and 
        related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for 
        minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
        airport-related markets across the Nation. These continuing 
        barriers merit the continuation of the airport disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
            (2) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. This 
        testimony and documentation shows that race- and gender-neutral 
        efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem.
            (3) This testimony and documentation demonstrates that 
        discrimination across the Nation poses a barrier to full and 
        fair participation in airport-related businesses of women 
        business owners and minority business owners in the racial 
        groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, and has impacted firm development and many aspects 
        of airport-related business in the public and private markets.
            (4) This testimony and documentation provides a strong basis 
        that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the 
        airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the 
        airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program to 
        address race and gender discrimination in airport-related 
        business.

    (b) Standardizing Certification of Disadvantaged Business 
Enterprises.--Section 47113 is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(e) Mandatory Training Program.--
            ``(1) In general.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Not later than 1 
        year after the date of enactment of this subsection, the 
        Secretary shall establish a mandatory training program for 
        persons described in paragraph (3) to provide streamlined 
        training on certifying whether a small business concern 
        qualifies as a small business concern owned and controlled by 
        socially and economically disadvantaged individuals under this 
        section and section 47107(e).
            ``(2) Implementation.--The training program may be 
        implemented by one or more private entities approved by the 
        Secretary.
            ``(3) Participants.--A person referred to in paragraph (1) 
        is an official or agent of an airport sponsor--
                    ``(A) who is required to provide a written assurance 
                under this section or section 47107(e) that the airport 
                owner or operator will meet the percentage goal of 
                subsection (b) of this section or section 47107(e)(1), 
                as the case may be; or
                    ``(B) who is responsible for determining whether or 
                not a small business concern qualifies as a small 
                business concern owned and controlled by socially and 
                economically disadvantaged individuals under this 
                section or section 47107(e).''.

    (c) Inspector General Report on Participation in FAA Programs by 
Disadvantaged Small Business Concerns.--
            (1) In general.--For each of fiscal years 2013 through 2015, 
        the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation shall 
        submit to Congress a report on the number of new small business 
        concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals, including those owned by veterans, 
        that participated in the programs and activities funded using 
        the amounts made available under this Act.
            (2) New small business concerns.--For purposes of subsection 
        (a), a new small business concern is a small business concern 
        that did not participate in the programs and activities 
        described in subsection (a) in a previous fiscal year.
            (3) Contents.--The report shall include--
                    (A) a list of the top 25 and bottom 25 large and 
                medium hub airports in terms of providing opportunities 
                for small business concerns owned and controlled by 
                socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to 
                participate in the programs and activities funded using 
                the amounts made available under this Act;
                    (B) the results of an assessment, to be conducted by 
                the Inspector General, on the reasons why the top 
                airports have been successful in providing such 
                opportunities; and
                    (C) recommendations to the Administrator of the 
                Federal Aviation Administration and Congress on methods 
                for other airports to achieve results similar to those 
                of the top airports.

SEC. 218. <<NOTE: 49 USC 40101 note.>> AIRSPACE REDESIGN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The airspace redesign efforts of the Federal Aviation 
        Administration will play a critical near-term role in enhancing

[[Page 126 STAT. 53]]

        capacity, reducing delays, transitioning to more flexible 
        routing, and ultimately saving money in fuel costs for airlines 
        and airspace users.
            (2) The critical importance of airspace redesign efforts is 
        underscored by the fact that they are highlighted in strategic 
        plans of the Administration, including Flight Plan 2009-2013 and 
        the NextGen Implementation Plan.
            (3) Funding cuts have led to delays and deferrals of 
        critical capacity enhancing airspace redesign efforts.
            (4) New runways planned for the period of fiscal years 2011

                        DISCLOSURE REPORTING SYSTEM.

    (a) Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program Defined.--In this 
section, the term ``Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program'' means the 
program established by the Federal Aviation Administration through 
Advisory Circular 00-58A, dated September 8, 2006, including any 
subsequent revisions thereto.
    (b) Verification.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall modify the Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program 
to require inspectors to--
            (1) verify that air carriers are implementing comprehensive 
        solutions to correct the underlying causes of the violations 
        voluntarily disclosed by such air carriers; and
            (2) confirm, before approving a final report of a violation, 
        that a violation with the same root causes, has not been 
        previously discovered by an inspector or self-disclosed by the 
        air carrier.

    (c) Supervisory Review of Voluntary Self-Disclosures.--The 
Administrator shall establish a process by which voluntary self-
disclosures received from air carriers are reviewed and approved by a 
supervisor after the initial review by an inspector.
    (d) Inspector General Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Inspector General of the Department of 
        Transportation shall conduct a study of the Voluntary Disclosure 
        Reporting Program.

                report under the provisions of the program;
                    (B) evaluates the effectiveness of corrective 
                actions taken by air carriers; and
                    (C) effectively prevents abuse of the voluntary 
                disclosure reporting program through its secondary 
                review of self-disclosures before they are accepted and 
                closed by the Administration.
            (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Inspector General shall 
        submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of

operations under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, and 
who accepts an additional assignment for flying under part 91 of such 
title from the air carrier or from any other air carrier conducting 
operations under part 121 or 135 of such title, to apply the period of 
the additional assignment

[[Page 126 STAT. 82]]

(regardless of whether the assignment is performed by the flight 
crewmember before or after an assignment to fly under part 121 of such 
title) toward any limitation applicable to the flight crewmember

        and retention tests specified by Technical Standard Orders C91a 
        and C126 are adequate to assess retention capabilities in ELT 
        designs.
            (2) Revision.--Based on the determination under paragraph 
        (1), the Administrator shall make any necessary revisions to the 
        requirements and retention tests referred to in paragraph (1) to 
        ensure that ELTs are properly retained in the event of an 
        aircraft accident.

    (c) Report.--Upon the completion of any revisions under subsection 
(b)(2), the Administrator shall submit a report on the implementation of 
this section to--
            (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
        of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of 
        the House of Representatives.

SEC. 405. AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Armed Forces is comprised of approximately 1,450,000 
        members who are stationed on active duty at more than 6,000 
        military bases in 146 different countries;
            (2) the United States is indebted to the members of the 
        Armed Forces, many of whom are in grave danger due to their 
        engagement in, or exposure to, combat;
            (3) military service, especially in the current war against 
        terrorism, often requires members of the Armed Forces to be

[[Page 126 STAT. 86]]

        separated from their families on short notice, for long periods 
        of time, and under very stressful conditions;
            (4) the unique demands of military service often preclude 
        members of the Armed Forces from purchasing discounted advance 
        airline tickets in order to visit their loved ones at home; and
            (5) it is the patriotic duty of the people of the United 
        States to support the members of the Armed Forces who are 
        defending the Nation's interests around the world at great 
        personal sacrifice.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) all United States commercial air carriers should seek to 
        lend their support with flexible, generous policies applicable 
        to members of the Armed Forces who are traveling on leave or 
        liberty at their own expense; and
            (2) each United States air carrier, for all members of the 
        Armed Forces who have been granted leave or liberty and who are 
        traveling by air at their own expense, should--
                    (A) seek to provide reduced air fares that are 
                comparable to the lowest airfare for ticketed flights 
                and that eliminate to the maximum extent possible 
                advance purchase requirements;

                        MANAGEMENT PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall carry out a 
pilot program at not more than 5 public-use airports under which the 
Federal Aviation Administration shall use funds made available under 
section 48101(a) to test air traffic flow management tools,

SEC. 509. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the European Union directive extending the European 
        Union's emissions trading proposal to international civil 
        aviation without working through the International Civil 
        Aviation Organization (in this section referred to as the 
        ``ICAO'') in

[[Page 126 STAT. 107]]

        a consensus-based fashion is inconsistent with the Convention on 
        International Civil Aviation, completed in Chicago on December 
        7, 1944 (TIAS 1591; commonly known as the ``Chicago 
        Convention''), and other relevant air services agreements and 
        antithetical to building international cooperation to address 
        effectively the problem of greenhouse gas emissions by aircraft 
        engaged in international civil aviation;
            (2) the European Union and its member states should instead 
        work with other contracting states of ICAO to develop a 
        consensual approach to addressing aircraft greenhouse gas 
        emissions through ICAO; and
            (3) officials of the United States Government, and 
        particularly the Secretary of Transportation and the 
        Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, should use 
        all political, diplomatic, and legal tools at the disposal of 
        the United States to ensure that the European Union's emissions 
        trading scheme is not applied to aircraft registered by the 
        United States or the operators of those aircraft, including the 
        mandates that United States carriers provide emissions data to 
        and purchase emissions allowances from or surrender emissions 
        allowances to the European Union Member States.

designee of the Secretary, may not issue or enforce any regulation or 
other requirement regarding the transportation by aircraft of lithium 
metal cells or batteries or lithium ion cells or batteries, whether 
transported separately or packed with or contained in equipment, if the 
requirement is more stringent than the requirements of the ICAO 
Technical Instructions.

        under section 172.102(c)(2) of title 49, Code of Federal

[[Page 126 STAT. 134]]

        the Secretary obtains a credible report with respect to a safety 
        incident from a national or international governmental 
        regulatory or investigating body that demonstrates that the 
        presence of lithium metal cells or batteries or lithium ion 
        cells or batteries on an aircraft, whether transported 
        separately or packed with or contained in equipment, in 
        accordance with the requirements of the ICAO Technical 
        Instructions, has substantially contributed to the initiation or 
        propagation of an onboard fire, the Secretary--
                    (A) may issue and enforce an emergency regulation, 
                more stringent than the requirements of the ICAO 
                Technical Instructions, that governs the transportation 
                by aircraft of such cells or batteries, if that 
                regulation--

                Technical Instructions, that governs the transportation 
                by aircraft of such cells or batteries, if--
                          (i) the Secretary bases the regulation upon 
                      substantial credible evidence that the otherwise 
                      permissible presence of such cells or batteries 
                      would substantially contribute to the initiation 
                      or propagation of an onboard fire;
                          (ii) the regulation addresses solely the 
                      deficiencies in existing regulations; and
                          (iii) the regulation imposes the least 
                      disruptive and least expensive variation from 
                      existing requirements while adequately addressing 
                      identified deficiencies.

preceding sentence shall not apply to any fixed-wing aircraft equipped

enactment of this Act.
SEC. 1106. <<NOTE: 26 USC 408 note.>> ROLLOVER OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED 
                          IN AIRLINE CARRIER BANKRUPTCY.

    (a) <<NOTE: Time period.>> General Rules.--
            (1) Rollover of airline payment amount.--If a qualified 
        airline employee receives any airline payment amount and 
        transfers any portion of such amount to a traditional IRA within 
        180 days of receipt of such amount (or, if later, within 180 
        days of the date of the enactment of this Act), then such amount 
        (to the extent so transferred) shall be treated as a rollover 
        contribution described in section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986. A qualified airline employee making such a 
        transfer may exclude from gross income the amount transferred, 
        in the taxable year in which the airline payment amount was paid 
        to the qualified airline employee by the commercial passenger 
        airline carrier.
            (2) Transfer of amounts attributable to airline payment 
        amount following rollover to roth ira.--A qualified airline 
        employee who has contributed an airline payment amount to a Roth 
        IRA that is treated as a qualified rollover contribution 
        pursuant to section 125 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer 
        Recovery Act of 2008, may transfer to a traditional IRA, in a 
        trustee-to-trustee transfer, all or any part of the contribution 
        (together with any net income allocable to such contribution), 
        and the transfer to the traditional IRA will be deemed to have 
        been made at the time of the rollover to the Roth IRA, if such 
        transfer is made within 180 days of the date of the enactment of 
        this Act. A qualified airline employee making such a transfer 
        may exclude from gross income the airline payment amount 
        previously rolled over to the Roth IRA, to the extent an amount 
        attributable to the previous rollover was transferred to a 
        traditional IRA, in the taxable year in which the airline 
        payment amount was paid to the qualified airline employee by the 
        commercial passenger airline carrier. No amount so transferred 
        to a traditional IRA may be treated as a qualified rollover 
        contribution with respect to a Roth IRA within the 5-taxable 
        year period beginning with the taxable year in which such 
        transfer was made.
            (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A qualified 
        airline employee who excludes an amount from gross income in a 
        prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may reflect such 
        exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the period of 
        limitation under section 6511(a) of such Code (or, if later, 
        April 15, 2013).
            (4) Overall limitation on amounts transferred to traditional 
        iras.--

[[Page 126 STAT. 153]]

                    (A) In general.--The aggregate amount of airline 
                payment amounts which may be transferred to 1 or more 
                traditional IRAs under paragraphs (1) and (2) with 
                respect to any qualified employee for any taxable year 
                shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--
                          (i) 90 percent of the aggregate airline 
                      payment amounts received by the qualified airline 
                      employee during the taxable year and all preceding 
                      taxable years, over
                          (ii) the aggregate amount of such transfers to 
                      which paragraphs (1) and (2) applied for all 
                      preceding taxable years.
                    (B) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> Special rules.--For 
                purposes of applying the limitation under subparagraph 
                (A)--
                          (i) any airline payment amount received by the 
                      surviving spouse of any qualified employee, and 
                      any amount transferred to a traditional IRA by 
                      such spouse under subsection (d), shall be treated 
                      as an amount received or transferred by the 
                      qualified employee, and
                          (ii) any amount transferred to a traditional 
                      IRA which is attributable to net income described 
                      in paragraph (2) shall not be taken into account.
            (5) Covered executives not eligible to make transfers.--
        Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to any transfer by a 
        qualified airline employee (or any transfer authorized under 
        subsection (d) by a surviving spouse of the qualified airline 
        employee) if at any time during the taxable year of the transfer 
        or any preceding taxable year the qualified airline employee 
        held a position described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 
        162(m)(3) with the commercial passenger airline carrier from 
        whom the airline payment amount was received.

    (b) Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for 
Employment Taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act, an airline 
payment amount shall not fail to be treated as a payment of wages by the 
commercial passenger airline carrier to the qualified airline employee 
in the taxable year of payment because such amount is excluded from the 
qualified airline employee's gross income under subsection (a).

            (1) Airline payment amount.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``airline payment amount''

                      paid in lieu of a note being issued), or any other 
                      fixed obligation of the carrier to pay a lump sum 
                      amount.
                The amount of such payment shall be determined without 
                regard to any requirement to deduct and withhold tax
