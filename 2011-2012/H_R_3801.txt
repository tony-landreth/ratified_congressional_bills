SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has worked collaboratively 
        with the Department of Homeland Security to identify equipment, 
        technology, and expertise used by the Department of Defense that 
        could be leveraged by the Department of Homeland Security to 
        help fulfill its missions.
            (2) As part of that collaborative effort, the Department of 
        Homeland Security has leveraged Department of Defense equipment, 
        technology, and expertise to enhance the ability of U.S. Customs 
        and Border Protection to detect, track, and engage illicit 
        trafficking across the international borders

[[Page 126 STAT. 9]]

         between the United States and Mexico and the United States and 
        Canada.
            (3) Leveraging Department of Defense equipment, technology, 
        and expertise is a cost-effective inter-agency approach to 
        enhancing the effectiveness of the Department of Homeland 
        Security to protect the United States against a variety of 
        threats and risks.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should--
            (1) continue the broad program of cooperation and 
        collaboration with the Secretary of Homeland Security described 
        in subsection (a); and
            (2) ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is able 
        to identify equipment and technology used by the Department of 
        Defense that could also be used by U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection to enhance its efforts to combat illicit trafficking 
        across the international borders between the United States and 
        Mexico and the United States and Canada, including equipment and 
        technology that could be used to detect and track the illicit 
        use of ultralight aircraft.

    Approved February 10, 2012.
