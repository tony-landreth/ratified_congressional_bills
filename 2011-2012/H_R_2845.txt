SEC. 5. <<NOTE: 49 USC 60109 note.>> INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT.

    (a) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Evaluation.--Not later than 18 months after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall 
evaluate--
            (1) whether integrity management system requirements, or 
        elements thereof, should be expanded beyond high-consequence 
        areas; and
            (2) with respect to gas transmission pipeline facilities, 
        whether applying integrity management program requirements, or 
        elements thereof, to additional areas would mitigate the need 
        for class location requirements.

    (b) Factors.--In conducting the evaluation under subsection (a), the 
Secretary shall consider, at a minimum, the following:
            (1) The continuing priority to enhance protections for 
        public safety.
            (2) The continuing importance of reducing risk in high-
        consequence areas.
            (3) The incremental costs of applying integrity management 
        standards to pipelines outside of high-consequence areas where 
        operators are already conducting assessments beyond what is 
        required under chapter 601 of title 49, United States Code.
            (4) The need to undertake integrity management assessments 
        and repairs in a manner that is achievable and sustainable, and 
        that does not disrupt pipeline service.

[[Page 125 STAT. 1908]]

            (5) The options for phasing in the extension of integrity 
        management requirements beyond high-consequence areas, including 
        the most effective and efficient options for decreasing risks to 
        an increasing number of people living or working in proximity to 
        pipeline facilities.
            (6) The appropriateness of applying repair criteria, such as 
        pressure reductions and special requirements for scheduling 
        remediation, to areas that are not high-consequence areas.

    (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a report, based on the evaluation conducted 
under subsection (a), containing the Secretary's analysis and findings 
regarding--
            (1) expansion of integrity management requirements, or 
        elements thereof, beyond high-consequence areas; and
            (2) with respect to gas transmission pipeline facilities, 
        whether applying the integrity management program requirements, 
        or elements thereof, to additional areas would mitigate the need 
        for class location requirements.

    (d) Data Reporting.--The Secretary shall collect any relevant data 
necessary to complete the evaluation required by subsection (a).
    (e) Technical Correction.--Section 60109(c)(3)(B) is amended to read 
as follows:
                    ``(B) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Subject to paragraph (5), 
                periodic reassessments of the facility, at a minimum of 
                once every 7 calendar years, using methods described in 
                subparagraph <<NOTE: Notification.>> (A). The Secretary 
                may extend such deadline for an additional 6 months if 
                the operator submits written notice to the Secretary 
                with sufficient justification of the need for the 
                extension.''.

    (f) Rulemaking Requirements.--
            (1) Review period defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``review period'' means the period beginning on the date of 
        enactment of this Act and ending on the earlier of--
                    (A) the date that is 1 year after the date of 
                completion of the report under subsection (c); or
                    (B) the date that is 3 years after the date of 
                enactment of this Act.
            (2) Congressional authority.--In order to provide Congress 
        the necessary time to review the results of the report required 
        by subsection (c) and implement appropriate recommendations, the 
        Secretary shall not, during the review period, issue final 
        regulations described in paragraph (3)(B).
            (3) Standards.--
                    (A) Findings.--As soon as practicable following the 
                review period, the Secretary shall issue final 
                regulations described in subparagraph (B), if the 
                Secretary finds, in the report required under subsection 
                (c), that--
                          (i) integrity management system requirements, 
                      or elements thereof, should be expanded beyond 
                      high-consequence areas; and

                          (ii) with respect to gas transmission pipeline 
                      facilities, applying integrity management program 
                      requirements, or elements thereof, to additional 
                      areas would mitigate the need for class location 
                      requirements.
                    (B) Regulations.--Regulations issued by the 
                Secretary under subparagraph (A), if any, shall--

                      requirements for gas transmission pipeline 
                      facilities that are regulated under an integrity 
                      management program adopted and implemented under 
                      section 60109(c)(2) of title 49, United States 
                      Code.
            (4) Savings clause.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  In general.--
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 
                the Secretary, during the review period, may issue final 
                regulations described in paragraph (3)(B), if the 
                Secretary determines that a condition that poses a risk 
                to public safety, property, or the environment is 
                present or an imminent hazard exists and that the 
                regulations will address the risk or hazard.
                    (B) Imminent hazard defined.--In subparagraph (A), 
                the term ``imminent hazard'' means the existence of a 
                condition related to pipelines or pipeline operations 
                that presents a substantial likelihood that death, 
                serious illness, severe personal injury, or substantial 
                endangerment to health, property, or the environment may 
                occur.

    (g) Report to Congress on Risk-Based Pipeline Reassessment 
Intervals.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall evaluate--
            (1) whether risk-based reassessment intervals are a more 
        effective alternative for managing risks to pipelines in high-
        consequence areas once baseline assessments are complete when 
        compared to the reassessment interval specified in section 
        60109(c)(3)(B) of title 49, United States Code;
            (2) the number of anomalies found in baseline assessments 
        required under section 60109(c)(3)(A) of title 49, United States 
        Code, as compared to the number of anomalies found in 
        reassessments required under section 60109(c)(3)(B) of such 
        title; and
            (3) the progress made in implementing the recommendations in 
        GAO Report 06-945 and the current relevance of those
