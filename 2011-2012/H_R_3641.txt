Public Law 112-245
112th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To establish Pinnacles National Park in the State of California as a 
 unit of the National Park System, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Jan. 
                       10, 2013 -  [H.R. 3641]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Pinnacles 
National Park Act. 16 USC 410ooo note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pinnacles National Park Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 410ooo.>> FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Pinnacles National Monument was established by 
        Presidential Proclamation 796 on January 16, 1908, for the 
        purposes of protecting its rock formations, and expanded by 
        Presidential Proclamation 1660 of May 7, 1923; Presidential 
        Proclamation 1704 of July 2, 1924; Presidential Proclamation 
        1948 of April 13, 1931; Presidential Proclamation 2050 of July 
        11, 1933; Presidential Proclamation 2528 of December 5, 1941; 
        Public Law 94-567; and Presidential Proclamation 7266 of January 
        11, 2000.
            (2) While the extraordinary geology of Pinnacles National 
        Monument has attracted and enthralled visitors for well over a 
        century, the expanded Monument now serves a critical role in 
        protecting other important natural and cultural resources and 
        ecological processes. This expanded role merits recognition 
        through legislation.
            (3) Pinnacles National Monument provides the best remaining 
        refuge for floral and fauna species representative of the 
        central California coast and Pacific coast range, including 32 
        species holding special Federal or State status, not only 
        because of its multiple ecological niches but also because of 
        its long-term protected status with 14,500 acres of 
        Congressionally designated wilderness.
            (4) Pinnacles National Monument encompasses a unique blend 
        of California heritage from prehistoric and historic Native 
        Americans to the arrival of the Spanish, followed by 18th and 
        19th century settlers, including miners, cowboys, vaqueros, 
        ranchers, farmers, and homesteaders.
            (5) Pinnacles National Monument is the only National Park 
        System site within the ancestral home range of the California 
        Condor. The reintroduction of the condor to its traditional 
        range in California is important to the survival of the species, 
        and as a result, the scientific community with centers at the 
        Los Angeles Zoo and San Diego Zoo in California and Buenos Aires 
        Zoo in Argentina looks to Pinnacles National Monument as

[[Page 126 STAT. 2386]]

        a leader in California Condor recovery, and as an international 
        partner for condor recovery in South America.
            (6) The preservation, enhancement, economic and tourism 
        potential and management of the central California coast and 
        Pacific coast range's important natural and cultural resources 
        requires cooperation and partnerships among local property 
        owners, Federal, State, and local government entities and the 
        private sector.
