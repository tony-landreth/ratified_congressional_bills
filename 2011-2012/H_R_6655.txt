Public Law 112-275
112th Congress

                                 An Act


 
      To establish a commission to develop a national strategy and 
 recommendations for reducing fatalities resulting from child abuse and 
            neglect. <<NOTE: Jan. 14, 2013 -  [H.R. 6655]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Protect our Kids 
Act of 2012. 42 USC 1305 note.>> 
SECTION 1. COMMISSION.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect our Kids Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) deaths from child abuse and neglect are preventable;
            (2) deaths from child abuse and neglect are significantly 
        underreported and there is no national standard for reporting 
        such deaths;
            (3) according to the Child Maltreatment Report of 2011, in 
        fiscal year 2011, 1,545 children in the United States are 
        reported to have died from child abuse and neglect, and many 
        experts believe that the actual number may be significantly 
        more;
            (4) over 42 percent of the number of children in the United 
        States who die from abuse are under the age of 1, and almost 82 
        percent are under the age of 4;
            (5) of the children who died in fiscal year 2011, 70 percent 
        suffered neglect either exclusively or in combination with 
        another maltreatment type and 48 percent suffered physical abuse 
        either exclusively or in combination;
            (6) increased understanding of deaths from child abuse and 
        neglect can lead to improvement in agency systems and practices 
        to protect children and prevent child abuse and neglect; and
            (7) Congress in recent years has taken a number of steps to 
        reduce child fatalities from abuse and neglect, such as--
                    (A) providing States with flexibility through the 
                Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act 
                of 2011 to operate child welfare demonstration projects 
                to test services focused on preventing abuse and neglect 
                and ensuring that children remain safely in their own 
                homes;
                    (B) providing funding through the Child and Family 
                Services Improvement Act of 2006 for services and 
                activities to enhance the safety of children who are at 
                risk of being placed in foster care as a result of a 
                parent's substance abuse;
                    (C) providing funding through the Fostering 
                Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 
                2008

[[Page 126 STAT. 2461]]

                for grants to facilitate activities such as family group 
                decisionmaking meetings and residential family treatment 
                programs to support parents in caring for their 
                children; and
                    (D) requiring States through the Child and Family 
                Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 to 
                describe how they will improve the quality of data 
                collected on fatalities from child abuse and neglect.
