SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) First Lieutenant Ryan Patrick Jones volunteered to serve 
        the United States in the Army.
            (2) Lieutenant Jones earned his rank, the Army Achievement 
        Medal, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Iraqi Freedom 
        Medal, the Combat Action Badge, and the War on Terrorism Badge 
        through his dedication to the highest ideals of the United 
        States.
            (3) Lieutenant Jones chose from a young age to generously 
        volunteer his talents to his community, and was recognized with 
        academic, social, and athletic leadership positions throughout 
        his life.
            (4) Lieutenant Jones committed himself to excellence in all 
        aspects of his life, including earning a Bachelor of Science 
        degree, with honors, in civil and environmental engineering.
            (5) While earning his engineering degree at Worcester 
        Polytechnic Institute, Lieutenant Jones was awarded a Reserve 
        Officers' Training Corps scholarship.
            (6) Lieutenant Jones faithfully and expertly led his fellow 
        soldiers as a platoon leader in the Army's First Infantry 
        Division while deployed to Iraq in 2007.
            (7) Lieutenant Jones made the ultimate sacrifice for the 
        United States on May 2, 2007, when he was killed in action by an 
        improvised explosive device set by the enemy.
            (8) Lieutenant Jones' life of service, courage, and honor 
        was made possible by his dedicated parents, Mr. Kevin Jones and 
        Mrs. Elaine Jones, who reside in Westminster, Massachusetts.
            (9) Mr. and Mrs. Jones organized the shipment of supplies to 
        soldiers serving alongside their son, thereby supporting the 
        morale of the members of the Armed Forces.
            (10) Before entering combat, Lieutenant Jones made 
        arrangements to ensure that his life insurance policy proceeds

[[Page 126 STAT. 2484]]

        would become a scholarship fund to benefit others, a request 
        that Mr. and Mrs. Jones fulfilled.
            (11) Lieutenant Jones is remembered by his family, his 
        friends, and the people of the United States as a role model for 
        his fellow citizens to emulate.
            (12) Lieutenant Jones' spirit of generosity has been 
        commemorated by organizations ranging from the Commonwealth of 
        Massachusetts to the Boston Celtics.
            (13) It is fitting that the life of Lieutenant Jones should 
        be further memorialized for future generations by naming the 
        post office in Westminster, Massachusetts, in his honor.
