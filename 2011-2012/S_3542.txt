SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No-Hassle Flying Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. PRECLEARANCE AIRPORTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 44901(d) of title 49, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(4) Preclearance airports.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For a flight or flight segment 
                originating at an airport outside the United States and 
                traveling to the United States with respect to which 
                checked baggage has been screened in accordance with an 
                aviation security preclearance agreement between the 
                United States and the country in which such airport is 
                located, the Assistant Secretary (Transportation 
                Security Administration) may, in coordination with U.S. 
                Customs and Border Protection, determine whether such 
                baggage must be re-screened in the United States by an 
                explosives detection system before such baggage 
                continues on any additional flight or flight segment.
                    ``(B) Aviation security preclearance agreement 
                defined.--In this paragraph, the term `aviation security 
                preclearance agreement' means an agreement that 
                delineates and implements security standards and 
                protocols that are determined by the Assistant 
                Secretary, in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection, to be comparable to those of the United 
                States and therefore sufficiently effective to enable 
                passengers to deplane into sterile areas of airports in 
                the United States.
                    ``(C) Report.--The Assistant Secretary shall submit 
                to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
                Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
                Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on 
                Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate 
                an annual report on the re-screening of baggage under 
                this paragraph. Each such report shall include the 
                following for the year covered by the report:
                          ``(i) A list of airports outside the United 
                      States from which a flight or flight segment 
                      traveled to the

[[Page 126 STAT. 1594]]

                      United States for which the Assistant Secretary 
                      determined, in accordance with the authority under 
                      subparagraph (A), that checked baggage was not 
                      required to be re-screened in the United States by 
                      an explosive detection system before such baggage 
                      continued on an additional flight or flight 
                      segment.
                          ``(ii) The amount of Federal savings generated 
                      from the exercise of such authority.''.

    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 44901 of title 49, United States 
Code, is amended by striking ``explosive'' each place it appears and 
inserting ``explosives''.

    Approved December 20, 2012.
