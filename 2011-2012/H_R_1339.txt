To designate the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the

                                1339]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 32 USC 101 note.>> OFFICIAL DESIGNATION OF 
                              SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS, AS THE 
                              BIRTHPLACE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD OF 
                              THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 1629, Captain John Endicott organized the first 
        militia in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Salem.
            (2) The colonists had adopted the English militia system, 
        which required all males between the ages of 16 and 60 to 
        possess arms and participate in the defense of the community.
            (3) In 1636, the Massachusetts General Court ordered the 
        organization of three militia regiments, designated as the 
        North, South, and East regiments.
            (4) These regiments drilled once a week and provided guard 
        details each evening to sound the alarm in case of attack.
            (5) The East Regiment, the predecessor of the 101st Engineer 
        Battalion, assembled as a regiment for the first time in 1637 on 
        the Salem Common, marking the beginning of the Massachusetts 
        National Guard and the National Guard of the United States.
            (6) Since 1785, Salem's own Second Corps of Cadets (101st 
        and 102nd Field Artillery) has celebrated the anniversary of 
        that first muster.
            (7) As the policy contained in section 102 of title 32, 
        United States Code, clearly expresses, the National Guard 
        continues its historic mission of providing units for the first 
        line defense of the United States and current missions 
        throughout the world.
            (8) The designation of the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as 
        the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States will 
        contribute positively to tourism and economic development in the 
        city, create jobs, and instill pride in both the local and State 
        communities.

    (b) Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as National Guard 
Birthplace.--In light of the findings made in subsection (a), the City 
of Salem, Massachusetts, is hereby designated as the Birthplace of the 
National Guard of the United States.
    (c) Responsibilities.--
            (1) Military ceremonial support.--The Chief of the National 
        Guard Bureau, in conjunction with the Secretary of

[[Page 126 STAT. 2373]]

        the Army, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Council of 
        Governors, and the Adjutant General of the State of 
        Massachusetts, shall provide military ceremonial support at the 
        dedication of any monument, plaque, or other form of official 
        recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, celebrating the 
        designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the 
        National Guard of the United States.
            (2) Funding source.--Federal funds may not be used to 
        design, procure, prepare, install, or maintain any monument, 
        plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, 
        Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, 
        Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the 
        United States, but the Adjutant General of the State of 
        Massachusetts may accept and expend contributions of non-Federal 
        funds for this purpose.

    Approved January 10, 2013.
