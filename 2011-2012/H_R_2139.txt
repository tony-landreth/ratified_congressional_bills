International Century of Service Commemorative Coin Act. 31 USC 5112 
note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lions Clubs International Century of 
Service Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) <<NOTE: Melvin Jones.>> Lions Clubs International is the 
        world's largest service club organization founded in 1917 by 
        Chicago business leader Melvin Jones. Lions Clubs International 
        empowers volunteers to serve their communities, meet 
        humanitarian needs, encourage peace and promote international 
        understanding through Lions clubs.
            (2) Today, Lions Clubs International has over 1.35 million 
        members in more than 45,000 clubs globally, extending its 
        mission of service throughout the world every day.
            (3) In 1945, Lions Clubs International became one of the 
        first nongovernmental organizations invited to assist in 
        drafting the United Nations Charter and has enjoyed a special 
        relationship with the United Nations ever since.
            (4) In 1968, Lions Clubs International Foundation was 
        established to assist with global and large-scale local 
        humanitarian projects and has since then awarded more than $700 
        million to fund five unique areas of service: preserving sight, 
        combating disability, promoting health, serving youth and 
        providing disaster relief.
            (5) In 1990, the Lions Clubs International Foundation 
        launched the SightFirst program to build comprehensive eye care 
        systems to fight the major causes of blindness and care for the 
        blind or visually impaired. Thanks to the generosity of Lions 
        worldwide, over $415 million has been raised, resulting in the 
        prevention of serious vision loss in 30 million people and 
        improved eye care for hundreds of millions of people.
            (6) On June 7, 2017, Lions Clubs International will 
        celebrate 100 years of community service to men, women, and 
        children in need throughout the world.
