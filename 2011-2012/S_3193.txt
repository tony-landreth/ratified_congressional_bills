 To make technical corrections to the legal description of certain land

          other purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 28, 2012 -  [S. 3193]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Barona Band of 
Mission Indians Land Transfer Clarification Act of 2012.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Barona Band of Mission Indians Land 
Transfer Clarification Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the legal description of land previously taken into 
        trust by the United States for the benefit of the Barona Band of 
        Mission Indians may be interpreted to refer to private, 
        nontribal land;
            (2) there is a continued, unresolved disagreement between 
        the Barona Band of Mission Indians and certain off-reservation 
        property owners relating to the causes of diminishing native 
        groundwater;
            (3) Congress expresses no opinion, nor should an opinion of 
        Congress be inferred, relating to the disagreement described in 
        paragraph (2); and
            (4) it is the intent of Congress that, if the land described 
        in section 121(b) of the Native American Technical Corrections 
        Act of 2004 (118 Stat. 544) (as amended by section 3) is used to 
        bring water to the Barona Indian Reservation, the effort is 
        authorized only if the effort also addresses water availability 
        for neighboring off-reservation land located along Old Barona 
        Road that is occupied as of the date of enactment of this Act by 
        providing guaranteed access to that water supply at a mutually 
        agreeable site on the southwest boundary of the Barona Indian 
        Reservation.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to clarify the legal description of the land placed into 
        trust for the Barona Band of Mission Indians in 2004; and
            (2) to remove all doubt relating to the specific parcels of 
        land that Congress has placed into trust for the Barona Band of 
        Mission Indians.
