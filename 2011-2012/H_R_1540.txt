        section referred to as ``OLED'') technology displays have the 
        potential to reduce the size, weight, and energy consumption of 
        both dismounted and mounted systems of the Armed Forces;
            (2) the United States has a limited OLED manufacturing 
        industry;
            (3) to ensure a reliable domestic source of OLED displays, 
        the Secretary of Defense can use existing programs, including 
        the ManTech program, to support the reduction of the costs and 
        risks related to OLED manufacturing technologies; and
            (4) the reduction of such costs and risks of OLED 
        manufacturing has the potential to enable the affordable 
        production and sustainment of future weapon systems, as well as 
        the affordable transition of new technologies that can enhance 
        capabilities of current force systems.

    (c) Usual <<NOTE: 32 USC 317 note.>>  and Customary Arrangement.--
            (1) Dual-status commander.--When the Armed Forces and the 
        National Guard are employed simultaneously in support of civil 
        authorities in the United States, appointment of a commissioned 
        officer as a dual-status commander serving on active duty and 
        duty in, or with, the National Guard of a State under sections 
        315 or 325 of title 32, United States Code, as commander of 
        Federal forces by Federal authorities and as commander of State 
        National Guard forces by State authorities, should be the usual 
        and customary command and control arrangement, including for 
        missions involving a major disaster or emergency as those terms 
        are defined in section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122). The chain 
        of command for the Armed Forces shall remain in accordance with 
        sections 162(b) and 164(c) of title 10, United States Code.
            (2) State authorities supported.--When a major disaster or 
        emergency occurs in any area subject to the laws of any State, 
        Territory, or the District of Columbia, the Governor of the 
        State affected normally should be the principal civil authority 
        supported by the primary Federal agency and its supporting 
        Federal entities, and the Adjutant General of the State or his 
        or her subordinate designee normally should be the principal 
        military authority supported by the dual-status commander when 
        acting in his or her State capacity.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraphs (1) or (2) 
        shall be construed to preclude or limit, in any way, the 
        authorities of the President, the Secretary of Defense, or the 
        Governor of any State to direct, control, and prescribe command 
        and control arrangements for forces under their command.

    (a) Independent Study Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
conduct an independent study of the feasibility and advisability of 
terminating the military technician as a distinct personnel management 
category of the Department of Defense.
    (b) Elements.--In conducting the study required by subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) identify various options for deploying units of the 
        Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve that otherwise use 
        military technicians through use of a combination of active duty 
        personnel, reserve component personnel, State civilian 
        employees, and Federal civilian employees in a manner that meets 
        mission requirements without harming unit readiness;
            (2) identify various means for the management by the 
        Department of the transition of military technicians to a system 
        that relies on traditional personnel categories of active duty 
        personnel, reserve component personnel, and civilian personnel, 
        and for the management of any effects of that transition on the 
        pay and benefits of current military technicians (including 
        means for mitigating or avoiding such effects in the course of 
        such transition);

[[Page 125 STAT. 1398]]

            (3) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  determine whether military 
        technicians who are employed at the commencement of the 
        transition described in paragraph (2) should remain as 
        technicians, whether with or without a military status, until 
        separation or retirement, rather than transitioned to such a 
        traditional personnel category;
            (4) identify and take into account the unique needs of the 
        National Guard in the management and use of military 
        technicians;
            (5) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  determine potential cost 
        savings, if any, to be achieved as a result of the transition 
        described in paragraph (2), including savings in long-term 
        mandatory entitlement costs associated with military and civil 
        service retirement obligations;
            (6) <<NOTE: Recommenda- tion.>>  develop a recommendation on 
        the feasibility and advisability of terminating the military 
        technician as a distinct personnel management category, and, if 
        the termination is determined to be feasible and advisable, 
        develop recommendations for appropriate legislative and 
        administrative action to implement the termination;
            (7) address any other matter relating to the management and 
        long-term viability of the military technician as a distinct 
        personnel management category that the Secretary shall specify 
        for purposes of the study; and
            (8) ensure the involvement and input of military technicians 
        (dual status).

    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees a report on the study required by subsection (a). The report 
shall set forth the results of the study, including the matters 
specified in subsection (b), and include such comments and 
recommendations on the results of the study as the Secretary considers 
appropriate.

                 Subtitle C--General Service Authorities

SEC. 521. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNIQUE NATURE, DEMANDS, AND 
                        HARDSHIPS OF MILITARY SERVICE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) section 8 (clauses 12, 13, and 14) of Article I of the 
        Constitution of the United States commits exclusively to 
        Congress the powers to raise and support armies, provide and 
        maintain a Navy, and make rules for the government and 
        regulation of the land and naval forces;
            (2) there is no constitutional right to serve in the Armed 
        Forces;
            (3) pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of article 
        I of the Constitution of the United States, it lies within the 
        discretion of the Congress to establish qualifications for and 
        conditions of service in the Armed Forces;
            (4) the primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to prepare 
        for and to prevail in combat should the need arise;
            (5) the conduct of military operations requires members of 
        the Armed Forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including the 
        ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common defense;

[[Page 125 STAT. 1399]]

            (6) success in combat requires military units that are 
        characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and 
        unit cohesion;
            (7) one of the most critical elements in combat capability 
        is unit cohesion, that is, the bonds of trust among individual 
        members of the Armed Forces that make the combat effectiveness 
        of a military unit greater than the sum of the combat 
        effectiveness of individual unit members;
            (8) military life is fundamentally different from civilian 
        life in that--
                    (A) the extraordinary responsibilities of the Armed 
                Forces, the unique conditions of military service, and 
                the critical role of unit cohesion require that the 
                military community, while subject to civilian control, 
                exist as a specialized society; and
                    (B) the military society is characterized by its own 
                laws, rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous 
                restrictions on personal behavior, that would not be 
                acceptable in civilian society;
            (9) the standards of conduct for members of the Armed Forces 
        regulate a member's life for 24 hours each day beginning at the 
        moment the member enters military status and not ending until 
        that person is discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed 
        Forces;
            (10) those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code 
        of Military Justice, apply to a member of the Armed Forces at 
        all times that the member has a military status, whether the 
        member is on base or off base, and whether the member is on duty 
        or off duty;
            (11) the pervasive application of the standards of conduct 
        is necessary because members of the Armed Forces must be ready 
        at all times for worldwide deployment to a combat environment;
            (12) the worldwide deployment of United States military 
        forces, the international responsibilities of the United States, 
        and the potential for involvement of the Armed Forces in actual 
        combat routinely make it necessary for members of the Armed 
        Forces involuntarily to accept living conditions and working 
        conditions that are often spartan, primitive, and characterized 
        by forced intimacy with little or no privacy; and
            (13) the Armed Forces must maintain personnel policies that 
        are intended to recruit and retain only those persons whose 
        presence in the Armed Forces serves the needs of the Armed 
        Forces, contributes to the accomplishment of the missions of the 
        Armed Forces, and maintains the high standards of the Armed 
        Forces for morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion 
        that are the essence of military capability.
SEC. 522. POLICY ADDRESSING DWELL TIME AND MEASUREMENT AND DATA

        major training events, and other exercises and contingencies of 
        such a scale that the exercises and contingencies receive an 
        official designation; and
            ``(B) the duration of their participation.

        eligible to receive the allowance if the duty assignment was not 
        excluded by the Secretary of Defense);
            ``(B) the number of members who received each rate of 
        allowance paid (estimated in the case of members described in

Chiefs of Staff) were deployed, and whether these units met the force 
goals for limiting deployments, as described in the personnel tempo 
policies applicable to that armed force.''.
    (c) Definitions.--Such section is further amended by adding at the 
end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) Other Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the term `dwell time' 
        means the time a member of the armed forces or a unit spends at 
        the permanent duty station or home port after returning from a 
        deployment.
            ``(B) The Secretary of Defense may modify the definition of

        authorized; and

SEC. 863. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORT ON AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO 
                        THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR MULTIYEAR 
                        CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ALTERNATIVE 
                        FUELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The procurement of alternative fuels by the Department 
        of Defense through the use of long-term contracts can provide 
        stability for industry, which could attract investment needed to 
        develop alternative fuel sources.
            (2) In appropriate circumstances, and with appropriate 
        protections, the use of long-term contracts for alternative 
        fuels can be in the best interest of the Department if the costs 
        of these contracts are competitive with other fuel contracts.
            (3) The Department has asked for the authority to enter into 
        long-term contracts for alternative fuels.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense should continue to pursue long-term contracting 
authority for alternative fuels, as well as traditional fuels, if the 
contracts will satisfy military requirements and result in equal or less 
cost to the Department over their duration.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the authorities currently available to 
the Department of Defense for multiyear contracts for the purchase of 
alternative fuels, including advanced biofuels. The report shall include 
a description of such additional authorities, if any, as the Secretary 
considers appropriate to authorize the Department to enter into 
contracts for the purchase of alternative fuels, including advanced 
biofuels, of sufficient length to reduce the impact to the Department of 
future price or supply shocks in the petroleum market, to benefit 
taxpayers, and to reduce United States dependence on foreign oil.

                    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection (c), the 
                Secretary has considered any confirmed case in which an 
                individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and
                    (D) the transfer is in the national security

                to match current and anticipated foreign satellite 
                imagery collection capabilities.
                    (D) Inconsistencies between the current resolution 
                restrictions on the sale or dissemination of imagery 
                collected by United States commercial companies, the 
                availability of higher resolution imagery from foreign 
                sources, and the National Space Policy of the United 
                States, released by the President on June 28, 2010.
                    (E) The lack of restrictions on the sale or

for determining locality pay for employees of the Department of Defense 
in circumstances that may be unique to such employees, such as the 
assignment of employees to a military installation so remote from the 
nearest established communities or suitable places of residence as to 
handicap significantly the recruitment or retention of well qualified 
individuals, due to the difference between the cost of living at the 
post of assignment and the cost of living in the locality or localities 
where such employees generally reside.

        that ``[a]ll countries are increasingly reliant on the vital 
        communication, transport and transit routes on which 
        international trade, energy security and prosperity depend. They 
        require greater international efforts to ensure their resilience 
        against attack or disruption. Some NATO countries will become 
        more dependent on foreign energy suppliers and in

[[Page 125 STAT. 1637]]

        some cases, on foreign energy supply and distribution networks 
        for their energy needs. As a larger share of world consumption 
        is transported across the globe, energy supplies are 
        increasingly exposed to disruption.''.
            (2) The new NATO Strategic Concept further declares that, 
        ``to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and 
        security of our populations'', the NATO alliance will, ``develop 
        the capacity to contribute to energy security, including 
        protection of critical energy infrastructure and transit areas 
        and lines, cooperation with partners, and consultations among 
        Allies on the basis of strategic assessments and contingency 
        planning.''.

SEC. 1237. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 
                          EXTENDED DETERRENCE POLICY.

    (a) Regarding Non-strategic Nuclear Weapons.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) if the United States pursues arms control negotiations 
        with the Russian Federation, such negotiations should be aimed 
        at the reduction of Russian deployed and non-deployed non-
        strategic nuclear weapons and increased transparency of such 
        weapons; and
            (2) for purposes of such negotiations--
                    (A) non-strategic nuclear weapons should be 
                considered when weighing the balance of the nuclear 
                forces of the United States and Russia; and

[[Page 125 STAT. 1642]]

                    (B) geographical relocation and consolidated or 
                centralized storage of non-strategic nuclear weapons by 
                Russia should not be considered a reduction or 
                elimination of such weapons.

    (b) Regarding Extended Deterrence Commitment to Europe.--It is the 
sense of Congress that--
            (1) the commitment of the United States to extended 
        deterrence in Europe and the nuclear alliance of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an important component of 
        ensuring and linking the national security of the United States 
        and its European allies;
            (2) nuclear forces of the United States are a key component 
        of the NATO nuclear alliance; and
            (3) the presence of United States nuclear weapons in 
        Europe--combined with NATO's unique nuclear sharing arrangements 
        under which non-nuclear members participate in nuclear planning 
        and possess specially configured aircraft capable of delivering 
        nuclear weapons--provides reassurance to NATO allies who feel 
        exposed to regional threats.

                          RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR OF IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury 
        issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31, United States 
        Code, that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money 
        laundering concern.
            (2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
        Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, ``The Central 
        Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted 
        designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to 
        these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several 
        billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, 
        EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making 
        these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by 
        minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks 
        with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.''.
            (3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the 
        Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, 
        wrote, ``Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking 
        sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist 
        financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering risks 
        for the global financial system.''.

    (b) Designation of Financial Sector of Iran as of Primary Money 
Laundering Concern.--The financial sector of Iran, including the Central 
Bank of Iran, is designated as a primary money laundering concern for 
purposes of section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, because of 
the threat to government and financial institutions resulting from the 
illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its pursuit of 
nuclear weapons, support for international terrorism, and efforts to 
deceive responsible financial institutions and evade sanctions.
    (c) <<NOTE: President.>>  Freezing of Assets of Iranian Financial 
Institutions.--The President shall, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and 
prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in property of 
an Iranian financial institution if such property and interests in 
property are in the United States, come within the United States, or are 
or come within the possession or control of a United States person.

    (d) Imposition of Sanctions With Respect to the Central Bank of Iran 
and Other Iranian Financial Institutions.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Effective date. President.>>  In general.--
        Except as specifically provided in this subsection, beginning on 
        the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment of this

                    (A) shall prohibit the opening, and prohibit or 
                impose strict conditions on the maintaining, in the 
                United States of a correspondent account or a payable-
                through account by a foreign financial institution that 
                the President determines has knowingly conducted or 
                facilitated any significant financial transaction with 
                the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian financial 
                institution designated by the Secretary of the Treasury 
                for the imposition of sanctions

[[Page 125 STAT. 1648]]

                pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
                Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); and
                    (B) may impose sanctions pursuant to the 
                International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.

                President shall make a determination, based on the 
                reports required by subparagraph (A), of whether the 
                price and supply of petroleum and petroleum products 
                produced in countries other than Iran is sufficient to 
                permit purchasers of petroleum and petroleum products 
                from Iran to reduce significantly in volume their 
                purchases from Iran.
                    (C) <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  Application of sanctions.--
                Except as provided in subparagraph (D), sanctions
