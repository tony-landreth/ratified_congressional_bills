        parcel to the Conservation District, or transfer of such portion 
        of the non-Federal exchange parcel to the United States, as the 
        case may be, as may be necessary to equalize the fair market 
        values of the exchanged properties. The fair market value of the 
        Federal exchange parcel or non-Federal exchange parcel, as the

                    (A) If the equalization payment is to equalize

                event Conservation District opts not to make the 
                indicated equalization payment, the exchange shall not 
                proceed.
                    (B) If the equalization payment is to equalize 
                values by which the non-Federal land exceeds the Federal 
                land and the credited value of the Federal exchange

                    (B) identification of the specific areas (including 
                maps) within units of the National Wildlife Refuge 
                System in the State that the Secretary determines should 
                be made available, consistent with the mission of the 
                National Wildlife Refuge System and the specific 
                purposes for which the unit was established, and this 
                subsection.
            (3) Factors to be considered.--In determining whether 
        Federal lands within units of the National Wildlife Refuge 
        System in the State should be made available under paragraph 
        (1)(A), the Secretary shall take into account--
                    (A) the proximity of the Federal land made available 
                for allotment selection under subsection (b)(5) to 
                eligible individuals;
                    (B) the proximity of the units of the National 
                Wildlife Refuge System in the State to eligible 
                individuals; and
                    (C) the amount of additional Federal land within 
                units of the National Wildlife Refuge System in the 
                State that the Secretary estimates would be necessary to 
                make allotments available for selection by eligible 
                individuals.
            (4) Identifying federal land in units of the national 
        wildlife refuge system.--In identifying whether Federal lands 
        within units of the National Wildlife Refuge System in the State 
        should be made available for allotment under paragraph (2)(B), 
        the Secretary shall not identify any Federal land in a unit of 
        the National Wildlife Refuge System--
                    (A) the conveyance of which, independently or as 
                part of a group of allotments--
                          (i) could significantly interfere with 
                      biological, physical, cultural, scenic, 
                      recreational, natural quiet, or subsistence values 
                      of the unit of the National Wildlife Refuge 
                      System;
                          (ii) could obstruct access by the public or 
                      the Fish and Wildlife Service to the resource 
                      values of the unit;
                          (iii) could trigger development or future uses 
                      in an area that would adversely affect resource 
                      values of the surrounding National Wildlife Refuge 
                      System land;
                          (iv) could open an area of a unit to new 
                      access and uses that adversely affect resources 
                      values of the unit; or
                          (v) could interfere with the management plan 
                      of the unit;

[[Page 133 STAT. 634]]

                    (B) that is located within 300 feet from the shore 
                of a navigable water body;
                    (C) that is not consistent with the purposes for 
                which the unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System 
                was established;
                    (D) that is designated as wilderness by Congress; or
                    (E) that is within the Arctic National Wildlife 
                Refuge.

    (d) Limitation.--No Federal land may be identified for selection or 
made available for allotment within a unit of the National Wildlife 
Refuge System unless it has been authorized by an Act of Congress 
subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act. Further, any proposed 
conveyance of land within a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System 
must have been identified by the Secretary in accordance with subsection 
(c)(4) in the report to Congress required by subsection (c) and include 
patent provisions that the land remains subject to the laws and 
regulations governing the use and development of the Refuge.

                not cancel or modify a grazing permit, lease, or 
                contract because the land subject to the permit, lease,

                   Subtitle D--Wild and Scenic Rivers

SEC. 1301. LOWER FARMINGTON RIVER AND SALMON BROOK WILD AND SCENIC 
                          RIVER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Study Act of 
        2005 (Public Law 109-370) authorized the study of the Farmington 
        River downstream from the segment designated as a recreational 
        river by section 3(a)(156) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 
        U.S.C. 1277(a)(156)) to its confluence with the Connecticut 
        River, and the segment of the Salmon Brook including its main 
        stem and east and west branches for potential inclusion in the 
        National Wild and Scenic Rivers System;
            (2) the studied segments of the Lower Farmington River and 
        Salmon Brook support natural, cultural, and recreational 
        resources of exceptional significance to the citizens of 
        Connecticut and the Nation;
            (3) concurrently with the preparation of the study, the 
        Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and Scenic Study 
        Committee prepared the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook 
        Management Plan, June 2011 (referred to in this section as the 
        ``management plan''), that establishes objectives, standards, 
        and action programs that will ensure the long-term protection of 
        the outstanding values of the river segments without Federal 
        management of affected lands not owned by the United States;
            (4) the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook Wild and 
        Scenic Study Committee has voted in favor of Wild and Scenic 
        River designation for the river segments, and has included this 
        recommendation as an integral part of the management plan;
            (5) there is strong local support for the protection of the 
        Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook, including votes of 
        support for Wild and Scenic designation from the governing 
        bodies of all ten communities abutting the study area;
            (6) the State of Connecticut General Assembly has endorsed 
        the designation of the Lower Farmington River and Salmon Brook 
        as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System 
        (Public Act 08-37); and
            (7) the Rainbow Dam and Reservoir are located entirely 
        outside of the river segment designated by subsection (b), and,

[[Page 133 STAT. 685]]

        based on the findings of the study of the Lower Farmington River 
        pursuant to Public Law 109-370, this hydroelectric project 
        (including all aspects of its facilities, operations, and 
        transmission lines) is compatible with the designation made by 
        subsection (b).

    (b) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 
U.S.C. 1274(a)) (as amended by section 1241(a)) is amended by adding at

                Farmington River as a recreational river.
                    ``(D) The approximately 12.6-mile segment of the 
                West Branch of Salmon Brook extending from its 
                headwaters in Hartland, Connecticut, to its confluence 
                with the East Branch of Salmon Brook as a recreational 
                river.
                    ``(E) The approximately 11.4-mile segment of the 
                East Branch of Salmon Brook extending from the

        public is allowed, under Federal or State law, to hunt, fish, or

[[Page 133 STAT. 761]]

list described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall develop and submit 
to the Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations and Natural Resources of

that--

        be provided to the legal boundaries of the land in a manner that 
        minimizes the impact on wildlife habitat and water quality;
            (2) specifies the steps recommended to secure the access and 
        egress, including acquiring an easement, right-of-way, or fee 
        title from a willing owner of any land that abuts the land or 
        the need to coordinate with State land management agencies or 
        other Federal, State, or Tribal governments to allow for such 
        access and egress; and
            (3) is consistent with the travel management plan in effect 
        on the land.

landowner has granted or denied public access or egress to the land.

public access and egress under subsections (b) and (c), the Secretary 
shall consider public access and egress to the legal boundaries of the 
land described in those subsections, including access and egress--
            (1) by motorized or non-motorized vehicles; and
            (2) on foot or horseback.

    (g) Effect.--
            (1) In general.--This section shall have no effect on 
        whether a particular recreational use shall be allowed on the 
        land included in a priority list under this section.

[[Page 133 STAT. 762]]

            (2) Effect of allowable uses on agency consideration.--In 
        preparing the priority list under subsection (b), the Secretary 
        shall only consider recreational uses that are allowed on the 
        land at the time that the priority list is prepared.
