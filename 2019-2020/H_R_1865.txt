second proviso and the availability of appropriations under this 
section:  Provided further, That no borrower may, for the same service, 
receive a reduction of loan obligations under both this section and 
section 428J, 428K, 428L, or 460 of such Act.

            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary

        Israel, including those to encourage allies and trading partners 
        of the United States to enact laws prohibiting businesses from 
        complying with the boycott and penalizing businesses that do

        Venezuela ended on January 10, 2019.
            (3) The National Assembly of Venezuela approved a resolution

        as the President of Venezuela.

        Assembly of Venezuela was sworn in as the Interim President of 
        Venezuela.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) to support the decisions by the United States

        advance efforts to hold democratic presidential elections in the 
        shortest possible period; and
            (3) that the Organization of American States, with support 
        from the United States Government and partner governments, 
        should provide diplomatic, technical, and financial support for 
        a new presidential election in Venezuela that complies with

SEC. 163. <<NOTE: 22 USC 9752.>>  CONCERNS OVER PDVSA TRANSACTIONS 
                        WITH ROSNEFT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In late 2016, Venezuelan state-owned oil company 
        Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (referred to in this section as 
        ``PDVSA''), through a no compete transaction, secured a loan 
        from Russian government-controlled oil company Rosneft, using 
        49.9 percent of PDVSA's American subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum 
        Corporation, including its assets in the United States, as 
        collateral. As a result of this transaction, 100 percent of 
        CITGO is held as collateral by PDVSA's creditors.
            (2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA, is engaged in 
        interstate commerce and owns and controls critical energy 
        infrastructure in 19 States of the United States, including an 
        extensive network of pipelines, 48 terminals, and 3 refineries, 
        with a combined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels per 
        day. CITGO's refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is the sixth 
        largest refinery in the United States.
            (3) The Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on 
        Rosneft, which is controlled by the Government of the Russian 
        Federation, and its Executive Chairman, Igor Sechin, following 
        Russia's military invasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation 
        of Crimea in 2014.

[[Page 133 STAT. 3042]]

            (4) The Department of Homeland Security has designated the 
        energy sector as critical to United States infrastructure.
            (5) The growing economic crisis in Venezuela raises the 
        probability that the Maduro regime and PDVSA will default on 
        their international debt obligations, resulting in a scenario in 
        which Rosneft could come into control of CITGO's United States 
        energy infrastructure holdings.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) control of critical United States energy infrastructure 
        by Rosneft, a Russian government-controlled entity currently 
        under United States sanctions that is led by Igor Sechin, who is 
        also under United States sanctions and is a close associate of 
        Vladimir Putin, would pose a significant risk to United States 
        national security and energy security; and
            (2) a default by PDVSA on its loan from Rosneft, resulting 
        in Rosneft coming into possession of PDVSA's United States CITGO 
        assets, would warrant careful consideration by the Committee on 
        Foreign Investment in the United States.

    (c) Preventing Rosneft From Controlling United States Energy 
Infrastructure.-- <<NOTE: President.>> The President shall take all 
necessary steps to prevent Rosneft from gaining control of critical 
United States energy infrastructure.

    (d) Security Risk Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report assessing 
the national security risks posed by potential Russian acquisition and 
control of CITGO's United States energy infrastructure holdings to--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;
            (2) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
        Affairs of the Senate;
            (3) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
        the Senate;
            (4) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives;
            (5) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
        Representatives; and
            (6) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
        Representatives.

            (2) Greece is a valuable member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) and a key pillar of stability in the Eastern 
        Mediterranean.
            (3) Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States and has 
        been designated a ``major non-NATO ally'' and ``major strategic 
        partner''.
            (4) Cyprus is a key strategic partner and signed a Statement 
        of Intent with the United States on November 6, 2018, to enhance 
        bilateral security cooperation.
            (5) The countries of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel have 
        participated in critical trilateral summits to improve 
        cooperation on energy and security issues.
            (6) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in the 
        trilateral summit among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus on March 20, 
        2019.
            (7) The United States, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus oppose any 
        action in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea that 
        could challenge stability, violate international law, or 
        undermine good neighborly relations, and in a joint declaration 
        on March 21, 2019, agreed to ``defend against external malign 
        influences in the Eastern Mediterranean and the broader Middle 
        East''.
            (8) The recent discovery of what may be the region's largest 
        natural gas field off the Egyptian coast and the newest 
        discoveries of natural gas off the coast of Cyprus could 
        represent a significant and positive development for the Eastern 
        Mediterranean and the Middle East, enhancing the region's 
        strategic energy significance.
            (9) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to promote, achieve, and maintain energy security among, 
        and through cooperation with, allies.
            (10) Natural gas developments in the Eastern Mediterranean 
        have the potential to provide economic gains and contribute to 
        energy security in the region and Europe, as well as support 
        European efforts to diversify away from natural gas supplied by 
        the Russian Federation.
            (11) The soon to be completed Trans Adriatic Pipeline is a 
        critical component of the Southern Gas Corridor and the European 
        Union's efforts to diversify energy resources.
            (12) The proposed Eastern Mediterranean pipeline, if 
        commercially viable, would provide for energy diversification in 
        accordance with the European Union's third energy package of 
        reforms.
            (13) The United States acknowledges the achievements and 
        importance of the Binational Industrial Research and Development 
        Foundation (BIRD) and the United States-Israel Binational 
        Science Foundation (BSF) and supports continued multiyear 
        funding to ensure the continuity of the programs of the 
        Foundations.
            (14) The United States has welcomed Greece's allocation of 2 
        percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to defense in 
        accordance with commitments made at the 2014 NATO Summit in 
        Wales.
            (15) Energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean region 
        must be safeguarded against threats posed by terrorist and 
        extremist groups, including Hezbollah and any other actor in the 
        region.

[[Page 133 STAT. 3050]]

            (16) The energy exploration in the Republic of Cyprus's 
        Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial waters--
                    (A) furthers United States interests by providing a 
                potential alternative to Russian gas for United States 
                allies and partners; and
                    (B) should not be impeded by other sovereign states.
            (17) The United States Government cooperates closely with 
        Cyprus, Greece, and Israel through information sharing 
        agreements.
            (18) United States officials have assisted the Government of 
        the Republic of Cyprus with crafting that nation's national 
        security strategy.
            (19) The United States Government provides training to 
        Cypriot officials in areas such as cybersecurity, 
        counterterrorism, and explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile 
        management.
            (20) Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are valued members of the 
        Proliferation Security Initiative to combat the trafficking of 
        weapons of mass destruction.
            (21) The Republic of Cyprus continues to work closely with 
        the United Nations and regional partners in Europe to combat 
        terrorism and violent extremism.
            (22) Despite robust economic and security relations with the 
        United States, the Republic of Cyprus has been subject to a 
        United States prohibition on the export of defense articles and 
        services since 1987.
            (23) The 1987 arms prohibition was designed to restrict 
        United States arms sales and transfers to the Republic of Cyprus 
        and the occupied part of Cyprus to avoid hindering reunification 
        efforts.
            (24) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the 
        occupied part of Cyprus with some weapons procured from the 
        United States through mainland Turkey.
            (25) While the United States has, as a matter of policy, 
        avoided the provision of defense articles and services to the 
        Republic of Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus has, in the past, 
        sought to obtain defense articles from other countries, 
        including countries, such as Russia, that pose challenges to 
        United States interests around the world.

        awareness;
            (10) to support the Republic of Cyprus' efforts to regulate 
        its banking industry to ensure that it is not used as a source 
        of international money laundering and encourage additional 
        measures toward that end;
            (11) to strongly oppose any actions that would trigger 
        mandatory sanctions pursuant to section 231 of the Countering

        in favor of equipment provided by NATO and NATO-allied member 
        countries; and
            (17) to strongly support the active and robust participation 
        of Israel, Cyprus, and Greece in the Combating Terrorism 
        Fellowship Program.

        subject to the United States Munitions List (part 121 of title 
        22, Code of Federal Regulations) to the Republic of Cyprus would

        Cyprus on other countries, including countries that pose 
        challenges to United States interests around the world, for 
        defense-related materiel; and

        unless the President determines and certifies to the appropriate 
        congressional committees not less than annually that--
                    (A) the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is 
                continuing to cooperate with the United States 
                Government in efforts to implement reforms on anti-money

SEC. 304. EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL 
                        DEVELOPMENT NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES 
                        PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Neglected Tropical Diseases Program, as in effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act, should--
            (1) provide integrated drug treatment packages to as many 
        individuals suffering from NTDs or at risk of acquiring NTDs, 
        including individuals displaced by manmade and natural 
        disasters, as logistically feasible;
            (2) better integrate NTD control and treatment tools and 
        approaches into complementary development and global health 
        programs by coordinating, to the extent practicable and 
        appropriate, across multiple sectors, including those relating 
        to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, education, nutrition, other 
        infectious diseases, maternal and child health, and water, 
        sanitation, and hygiene;
            (3) establish low-cost, high-impact community- and school-
        based NTD programs to reach large at-risk populations, including 
        school-age children, with integrated drug treatment packages, as 
        feasible;
            (4) as opportunities emerge and resources allow, engage in 
        research and development of new tools and approaches to reach 
        the goals relating to the elimination of NTDs as set forth by 
        the 2012 World Health Organization publication ``Accelerating 
        Work to Overcome the Global Impact of Neglected Tropical 
        Diseases: A Roadmap for Implementation'', including for Chagas 
        disease, Guinea worm, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping 
        sickness), leprosy, and visceral leishmaniasis; and

[[Page 133 STAT. 3057]]

            (5) monitor research on and developments in the prevention 
        and treatment of other NTDs so breakthroughs can be incorporated 
        into the Neglected Tropical Diseases Program, as practicable and 
        appropriate.

    (b) Program Priorities.--The Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development (referred to in this section as the 
``Administrator'') should incorporate the following priorities into the 
Neglected Tropical Diseases Program (as in effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act):
            (1) Planning for and conducting robust monitoring and 
        evaluation of program investments in order to accurately measure 
        impact, identify and share lessons learned, and inform future 
        NTD control and elimination strategies.
            (2) Coordinating program activities with complementary 
        development and global health programs of the United States 
        Agency for International Development, including programs 
        relating to water, sanitation, and hygiene, food and nutrition 
        security, and education (both primary and secondary), in order 
        to advance the goals of the London Declaration on Neglected 
        Tropical Diseases (2012).
            (3) Including morbidity management in treatment plans for 
        high-burden NTDs.
            (4) Incorporating NTDs included in the Global Burden of 
        Disease Study 2010 into the program as opportunities emerge, to 
        the extent practicable and appropriate.
            (5) Continuing investments in the research and development 
        of new tools and approaches that complement existing research 
        investments and ensure that new discoveries make it through the 
        pipeline and become available to individuals who need them most.
SEC. 305. ACTIONS BY DEPARTMENT OF STATE.

    (a) Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to 
Combat HIV/AIDS Globally should fully consider evolving research on the 
impact of NTDs on efforts to control HIV/AIDS when making future 
programming decisions, as necessary and appropriate.
    (b) Global Programming.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of State should encourage the 
        Global Fund to take into consideration evolving research on the 
        impact of NTDs on efforts to control HIV/AIDS when making 
        programming decisions, particularly with regard to female 
        genital schistosomiasis, which studies suggest may be one of the 
        most significant cofactors in the AIDS epidemic in Africa, as 
        necessary and appropriate.
            (2) <<NOTE: Definition.>>  Global fund.--In this subsection, 
        the term ``Global Fund'' means the public-private partnership 
        known as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
        established pursuant to Article 80 of the Swiss Civil Code.

    (c) G-20 Countries.--The Secretary of State, acting through the 
Office of Global Health Diplomacy, should encourage G-20 countries to 
significantly increase their role in the control and elimination of 
NTDs.
SEC. 306. MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the treatment of NTDs, including 
community- and school-based deworming programs, can

[[Page 133 STAT. 3058]]

be a highly cost-effective intervention, and schools can serve as an 
effective delivery mechanism for reaching large numbers of children with 
safe treatment for soil-transmitted helminthiases (roundworm, whipworm, 
and hookworm) in particular.
    (b) United Nations.--The President should direct the United States 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, 
and influence of the United States to urge the World Health Organization 
and the United Nations Development Programme to--
            (1) ensure the dissemination of best practices and 
        programming on NTDs to governments and make data accessible to 
        practitioners in an open and timely fashion;
            (2) highlight impacts of community- and school-based 
        deworming programs on children's health and education, 
        emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of such programs;
            (3) encourage governments to implement deworming campaigns 
        at the national level;
            (4) consider the designation of a portion of grant funds of 
        the institutions to deworming initiatives and cross-sectoral 
        collaboration with water, sanitation, and hygiene efforts and 
        nutrition or education programming, as practicable and 
        appropriate;
            (5) encourage accurate monitoring and evaluation of NTD 
        programs, including deworming programs; and
            (6) engage governments in cross-border initiatives for the 
        treatment, control, prevention, and elimination of NTDs, and 
        assist in developing transnational agreements, when and where 
        necessary.

 TITLE IV-- <<NOTE: Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced Populations 
     Act. 22 USC 287 note.>> PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DISPLACED 
POPULATIONS
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Preventing Child Marriage in 
Displaced Populations Act''.
SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 
        12,000,000 girls marry before the age of 18 every year.
            (2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their 
        right to make vital decisions about their well-being, including 
        relating to their health, family, and career. Child brides are 
        less likely to finish their education, and are at higher risk 
        for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or giving 
        birth.
            (3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs 
        to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity 
        gains.
            (4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to 
        child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability, and

[[Page 133 STAT. 3059]]

        displacement put pressure on families to marry children, 
        particularly young girls, off at a young age.
            (5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage 
        rates were 4 times higher among displaced Syrian refugees than 
        among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that 
        displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child 
        marriages.
            (6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and the United 
        Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have 
        acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken steps to 
        address its risk in the populations they serve.
            (7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this 
        work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly 
        prevent child marriage and by generating new data and evidence 
        on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile 
        settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child 
        Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls strengthen critical 
        skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns, as 
        well as life skills and financial literacy training.
            (8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified 
        Yemen as one of its focus countries, 65,000 people, of whom 
        45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising 
        activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a 
        result, local council representatives, elders, and community 
        leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to support advocacy 
        efforts to end child marriage.

                    (C) advance clearly defined goals, objectives, and

        organizations.
            (2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens endangered 
        species worldwide, but also jeopardizes local security, spreads 
        disease, undermines rule of law, fuels corruption, and damages 
        economic development.
            (3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires a coordinated 
        and sustained approach at the global, regional, national, and 
        local levels.
            (4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neutralize, and 
        Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 that it is the policy 
        of the United States to take immediate actions to stop the 
        illegal global trade in wildlife and wildlife products and 
        associated transnational organized crime.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of State's rewards program is a powerful tool in combating 
sophisticated international crime and that the Department of State and 
Federal law enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that 
target wildlife traffickers.

Act of 2019.>> CHAMPIONING AMERICAN BUSINESS THROUGH DIPLOMACY
SEC. 701. <<NOTE: 22 USC 9901 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Championing American Business 
Through Diplomacy Act of 2019''.
SEC. 702. <<NOTE: 22 USC 9901.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the 2017 National Security Strategy of the 
        United States of America, ``Retaining our position as the

[[Page 133 STAT. 3070]]

        world's preeminent economic actor strengthens our ability to use 
        the tools of economic diplomacy for the good of Americans and 
        others.''.
            (2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Secretary of State 
        Michael R. Pompeo to all diplomatic and consular posts--
        ``Boosting Commercial Diplomacy Around the World''--stated that 
        ``helping American companies is a foreign policy priority. . 
        .Promoting broad-based, responsible, and sustainable economic 
        growth helps to stabilize regions and creates new and growing 
        markets for U.S. companies. A transparent and level playing 
        field for U.S. investment in these countries counters real and 
        growing challenges such as China's Belt and Road initiative.''.
            (3) In the January-February 2019 issue of The Foreign 
        Service Journal, Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, the President of 
        the American Foreign Service Association, wrote, ``Foreign 
        Service support for American business. . .is a major reason why 
        the U.S. Foreign Service was created.''.

        Law Enforcement Museum on Federal land in the District of

                public they serve;

                law enforcement and to promote law enforcement safety;

                      may submit to the Secretary a written request for 
                      the eligible product developer to be authorized to 
                      obtain sufficient quantities of an individual 
                      covered product subject to a REMS with ETASU.

                      authorize the eligible product developer to obtain 
                      sufficient quantities of an individual covered 
                      product subject to a REMS with ETASU for purposes 
                      of--
                                    (I) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  
                                development and testing that does not 
                                involve human clinical trials, if the 
                                eligible product developer has agreed to 
                                comply with any conditions the Secretary 
                                determines necessary; or

                                involves human clinical trials, if the

                                            (aa)(AA) submitted 
                                        protocols, informed consent

                                        materials for testing that 
                                        include protections that provide 
                                        safety protections comparable to 
                                        those provided by the REMS for 
                                        the covered product; or
                                            (BB) otherwise satisfied the 
                                        Secretary that such protections 
                                        will be provided; and
                                            (bb) met any other 
                                        requirements the Secretary may 
                                        establish.
                          (iii) Notice.--A covered product authorization 
                      issued under this subparagraph shall state that 
                      the provision of the covered product by the 
                      license holder under the terms of the 
                      authorization will not be a violation of the REMS 
                      for the covered product.

[[Page 133 STAT. 3134]]

            (3) Affirmative defense.--In a civil action brought under 
        paragraph (1), it shall be an affirmative defense, on which the 
        defendant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the 
        evidence--
                    (A) that, on the date on which the eligible product 
                developer requested to purchase sufficient quantities of 
                the covered product from the license holder--
                          (i) neither the license holder nor any of its 
                      agents, wholesalers, or distributors was engaged 
                      in the manufacturing or commercial marketing of 
                      the covered product; and
                          (ii) neither the license holder nor any of its 
                      agents, wholesalers, or distributors otherwise had 
                      access to inventory of the covered product to 
                      supply to the eligible product developer on 
                      commercially reasonable, market-based terms;
                    (B) that--
                          (i) the license holder sells the covered 
                      product through agents, distributors, or 
                      wholesalers;
                          (ii) the license holder has placed no 
                      restrictions, explicit or implicit, on its agents, 
                      distributors, or wholesalers to sell covered 
                      products to eligible product developers; and
                          (iii) the covered product can be purchased by 
                      the eligible product developer in sufficient 
                      quantities on commercially reasonable, market-
                      based terms from the agents, distributors, or 
                      wholesalers of the license holder; or
                    (C) <<NOTE: Deadlines.>>  that the license holder 
                made an offer to the individual specified pursuant to 
                paragraph (2)(A)(iii)(III), by a means of communication 
                (electronic, written, or both) specified pursuant to 
                such paragraph, to sell sufficient quantities of the 
                covered product to the eligible product developer at 
                commercially reasonable market-based terms--
                          (i) for a covered product that is not subject 
                      to a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 14 days 
                      after the date on which the license holder 
                      received the request for the covered product, and 
                      the eligible product developer did not accept such 
                      offer by the date that is 7 days after the date on 
                      which the eligible product developer received such 
                      offer from the license holder; or
                          (ii) for a covered product that is subject to 
                      a REMS with ETASU, by the date that is 20 days 
                      after the date on which the license holder 
                      received the request for the covered product, and 
                      the eligible product developer did not accept such 
                      offer by the date that is 10 days after the date 
                      on which the eligible product developer received 
                      such offer from the license holder.
            (4) Remedies.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Courts.>>  In general.--If an eligible 
                product developer prevails in a civil action brought 
                under paragraph (1), the court shall--
                          (i) order the license holder to provide to the 
                      eligible product developer without delay 
                      sufficient quantities

[[Page 133 STAT. 3135]]

                      of the covered product on commercially reasonable, 
                      market-based terms;
                          (ii) award to the eligible product developer 
                      reasonable attorney's fees and costs of the civil 
                      action; and
                          (iii) award to the eligible product developer 
                      a monetary amount sufficient to deter the license 
                      holder from failing to provide eligible product 
                      developers with sufficient quantities of a covered 
                      product on commercially reasonable, market-based 
                      terms, if the court finds, by a preponderance of 
                      the evidence--
                                    (I) that the license holder delayed 
                                providing sufficient quantities of the 
                                covered product to the eligible product 
                                developer without a legitimate business 
                                justification; or
                                    (II) that the license holder failed 
                                to comply with an order issued under 
                                clause (i).
                    (B) Maximum monetary amount.--A monetary amount 
                awarded under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall not be greater 
                than the revenue that the license holder earned on the 
                covered product during the period--
                          (i) <<NOTE: Effective dates. Time periods.>>  
                      beginning on--
                                    (I) for a covered product that is 
                                not subject to a REMS with ETASU, the 
                                date that is 31 days after the date on 
                                which the license holder received the 
                                request; or
                                    (II) for a covered product that is 
                                subject to a REMS with ETASU, the date 
                                that is 31 days after the later of--
                                            (aa) the date on which the 
                                        license holder received the 
                                        request; or
                                            (bb) the date on which the 
                                        license holder received a copy 
                                        of the covered product 
                                        authorization issued by the 
                                        Secretary in accordance with 
                                        paragraph (2)(B); and
                          (ii) <<NOTE: Termination date.>>  ending on 
                      the date on which the eligible product developer 
                      received sufficient quantities of the covered 
                      product.
                    (C) Avoidance of delay.--The court may issue an 
                order under subparagraph (A)(i) before conducting 
                further proceedings that may be necessary to determine 
                whether the eligible product developer is entitled to an 
                award under clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A), or 
                the amount of any such award.

    (c) Limitation of Liability.--A license holder for a covered product 
shall not be liable for any claim under Federal, State, or local law 
arising out of the failure of an eligible product developer to follow 
adequate safeguards to assure safe use of the covered product during 
development or testing activities described in this section, including 
transportation, handling, use, or disposal of the covered product by the 
eligible product developer.
    (d) No Violation of REMS.--Section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(l) Provision of Samples Not a Violation of Strategy.--The 
provision of samples of a covered product to an eligible product 
developer (as those terms are defined in section 610(a) of division N of 
the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020) shall not

[[Page 133 STAT. 3136]]

be considered a violation of the requirements of any risk evaluation and 
mitigation strategy that may be in place under this section for such 
drug.''.
    (e) Rule of Construction.--
            (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``antitrust 
        laws''--
                    (A) has the meaning given the term in subsection (a) 
                of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12); 
                and
                    (B) includes section 5 of the Federal Trade 
                Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such 
                section applies to unfair methods of competition.
            (2) Antitrust laws.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to limit the operation of any provision of the 
        antitrust laws.

    (f) REMS Approval Process for Subsequent Filers.--Section 505-1 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1), as amended 
by subsection (d), is further amended--
            (1) in subsection (g)(4)(B)--
                    (A) in clause (i) by striking ``or'' after the 
                semicolon;
                    (B) in clause (ii) by striking the period at the end 
                and inserting ``; or''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                          ``(iii) accommodate different, comparable 
                      aspects of the elements to assure safe use for a 
                      drug that is the subject of an application under 
                      section 505(j), and the applicable listed drug.'';
            (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking subparagraph (C) and 
        inserting the following:
                    ``(C)(i) Elements to assure safe use, if required 
                under subsection (f) for the listed drug, which, subject 
                to clause (ii), for a drug that is the subject of an 
                application under section 505(j) may use--
                          ``(I) a single, shared system with the listed 
                      drug under subsection (f); or
                          ``(II) a different, comparable aspect of the 
                      elements to assure safe use under subsection (f).
                    ``(ii) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  The Secretary may 
                require a drug that is the subject of an application 
                under section 505(j) and the listed drug to use a 
                single, shared system under subsection (f), if the 
                Secretary determines that no different, comparable 
                aspect of the elements to assure safe use could satisfy 
                the requirements of subsection (f).'';
            (3) in subsection (i), by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Shared rems.--If the Secretary approves, in accordance 
        with paragraph (1)(C)(i)(II), a different, comparable aspect of 
        the elements to assure safe use under subsection (f) for a drug 
        that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application under 
        section 505(j), the Secretary may require that such different 
        comparable aspect of the elements to assure safe use can be used 
        with respect to any other drug that is the subject of an 
        application under section 505(j) or 505(b) that references the 
        same listed drug.''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(m) <<NOTE: Definition.>>  Separate REMS.--When used in this 
section, the term `different, comparable aspect of the elements to 
assure safe use' means a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for a 
drug that

[[Page 133 STAT. 3137]]

is the subject of an application under section 505(j) that uses 
different methods or operational means than the strategy required under 
subsection (a) for the applicable listed drug, or other application 
under section 505(j) with the same such listed drug, but achieves the 
same level of safety as such strategy.''.

    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section, the amendments 
made by this section, or in section 505-1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1), shall be construed as--
            (1) prohibiting a license holder from providing an eligible 
        product developer access to a covered product in the absence of 
        an authorization under this section; or
            (2) in any way negating the applicability of a REMS with 
        ETASU, as otherwise required under such section 505-1, with 
        respect to such covered product.

    Not <<NOTE: Deadline. Guidance.>>  later than six months after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 
guidance to provide that, if an employer terminates the plan under which 
amounts are contributed to a custodial account under subparagraph (A) of 
section 403(b)(7), the plan administrator or custodian may distribute an 
individual custodial account in kind to a participant or beneficiary of 
the plan and the distributed custodial account shall be maintained by 
the custodian on a tax-deferred basis as a section 403(b)(7) custodial 
account, similar to the treatment of fully-paid individual annuity 
contracts under Revenue Ruling 2011-7, until amounts are actually paid 
to the participant or beneficiary. The guidance shall provide further 
(i) that the section 403(b)(7) status of the distributed custodial 
account is generally maintained if the custodial account thereafter 
adheres to the requirements of section 403(b) that are in effect at the 
time of the distribution of the account and (ii) that a custodial 
account would not be considered distributed to the participant or 
beneficiary if the employer has any material retained rights under the 
account (but the employer would not be treated as retaining material 
rights simply because the custodial account was originally opened under 
a group contract). <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  Such guidance shall be 
retroactively effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 
2008.

        this section shall, with respect to the acreage limitation 
        provisions of the reclamation laws--

                Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 390bb)) has 
                discharged the obligation of the district to repay the 
                construction cost of project facilities used to make 
                irrigation water available for delivery to land in the 
                district;

                or
                    (C) serve as the basis for increasing the 
                construction repayment obligation of the district, which 
                would extend the period during which the acreage 
                limitation provisions would apply.
            (2) Effect on water rights.--Nothing in this section--
                    (A) creates Federal water rights; or

SEC. 201. <<NOTE: 16 USC 941h.>>  GREAT LAKES MONITORING, 
                        ASSESSMENT, SCIENCE, AND RESEARCH.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:

[[Page 133 STAT. 3185]]

            (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of 
        the United States Geological Survey.
            (2) Great lakes basin.--The term ``Great Lakes Basin'' means 
        the air, land, water, and living organisms in the United States 
        within the drainage basin of the Saint Lawrence River at and 
        upstream from the point at which such river and the Great Lakes 
        become the international boundary between Canada and the United 
        States.

    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Great Lakes support a diverse ecosystem, on which 
        the vibrant and economically valuable Great Lakes fisheries 
        depend.
            (2) To continue successful fisheries management and 
        coordination, as has occurred since signing of the Convention on 
        Great Lakes Fisheries between the United States and Canada on 
        September 10, 1954, management of the ecosystem and its 
        fisheries require sound, reliable science, and the use of modern 
        scientific technologies.
            (3) Fisheries research is necessary to support multi-
        jurisdictional fishery management decisions and actions 
        regarding recreational and sport fishing, commercial fisheries, 
        tribal harvest, allocation decisions, and fish stocking 
        activities.
            (4) President Richard Nixon submitted, and the Congress 
        approved, Reorganization Plan No. 4 (84 Stat. 2090), conferring 
        science activities and management of marine fisheries to the 
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
            (5) Reorganization Plan No. 4 expressly excluded fishery 
        research activities within the Great Lakes from the transfer, 
        retaining management and scientific research duties within the 
        already-established jurisdictions under the 1954 Convention on 
        Great Lakes Fisheries, including those of the Great Lakes 
        Fishery Commission and the Department of the Interior.

    (c) Monitoring, Assessment, Science, and Research.--
            (1) In general.--The Director may conduct monitoring, 
        assessment, science, and research, in support of the binational 
        fisheries within the Great Lakes Basin.
            (2) Specific authorities.--The Director shall, under 
        paragraph (1)--
                    (A) execute a comprehensive, multi-lake, freshwater 
                fisheries science program;
                    (B) <<NOTE: Coordination.>>  coordinate with and 
                work cooperatively with regional, State, tribal, and 
                local governments; and
                    (C) <<NOTE: Consultation.>>  consult with other 
                interested entities groups, including academia and 
                relevant Canadian agencies.
            (3) Included research.--To properly serve the needs of 
        fisheries managers, monitoring, assessment, science, and 
        research under this section may include--
                    (A) deepwater ecosystem sciences;
                    (B) biological and food-web components;
                    (C) fish movement and behavior investigations;
                    (D) fish population structures;
                    (E) fish habitat investigations;
                    (F) invasive species science;
                    (G) use of existing, new, and experimental 
                biological assessment tools, equipment, vessels, other 
                scientific instrumentation and laboratory capabilities 
                necessary to support fishery management decisions; and

[[Page 133 STAT. 3186]]

                    (H) studies to assess impacts on Great Lakes Fishery 
                resources.
            (4) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section is intended or 
        shall be construed to impede, supersede, or alter the authority 
        of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, States, and Indian tribes 
        under the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between the United 
        States of America and Canada on September 10, 1954, and the 
        Great Lakes Fishery Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 931 et seq.).

    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2025, there is authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000 to
