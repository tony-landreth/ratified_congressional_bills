SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) an infectious disease pandemic known as COVID-19 exists;
            (2) to date, there is much still unknown about COVID-19, but 
        it is known that COVID-19 and related complications may be 
        fatal;
            (3) services provided by public safety officers are 
        nonetheless essential during this pandemic;
            (4) due to the COVID-19 pandemic and what is currently known 
        about how the disease is spread, public safety officers are 
        uncharacteristically at risk of contracting the disease; and
            (5) although the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program 
        currently covers deaths and permanent and total disabilities 
        resulting from infectious disease sustained by public safety 
        officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of 
        claims involving personal injuries believed to have resulted 
        from COVID-19 or its complications may be uniquely challenging 
        or delayed given the lack of--
                    (A) definitive testing and medical records at this 
                time; and
                    (B) a definitive uniform body of medical information 
                about how the disease is spread or its effects.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a carefully 
drawn framework wherein claims under the Public Safety Officers' 
Benefits program, arising under the unique circumstances described in 
subsection (a), can be processed expeditiously and under fair and clear 
standards.
SEC. 3. <<NOTE: Time period.>>  PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BENEFITS.

    (a) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Death Benefits.--As determined by the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance, unless competent medical evidence 
establishes that the death of a public safety officer (as defined in 
section 1204 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968

[[Page 134 STAT. 705]]

(34 U.S.C. 10284)) was directly and proximately caused by something 
other than COVID-19, COVID-19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by 
the public safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal 
injury within the meaning of section 1201(a) of title I of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(a)), 
sustained in the line of duty by the officer and directly and 
proximately resulting in death, if--
            (1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity 
        between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021;
            (2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID-19 (or evidence 
        indicates that the officer had COVID-19) during the 45-day 
        period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer; and
            (3) evidence indicates that the officer had COVID-19 (or 
        complications therefrom) at the time of the officer's death.

    (b) Disability Benefits.--As determined by the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance, COVID-19 (or complications therefrom) suffered by a public 
safety officer shall be presumed to constitute a personal injury within 
the meaning of section 1201(b) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281(b)), sustained in the line 
of duty by the officer, if--
            (1) the officer engaged in a line of duty action or activity 
        between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021; and
            (2) the officer was diagnosed with COVID-19 (or evidence 
        indicates that the officer had COVID-19) during the 45-day 
        period beginning on the last day of duty of the officer.

    Approved August 14, 2020.
