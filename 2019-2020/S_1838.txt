SEC. 3. <<NOTE: 22 USC 5701 note.>>  STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in 
        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-
        383), namely that--
                    (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in the 
                continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong 
                Kong'';
                    (B) ``[s]upport for democratization is a fundamental 
                principle of United States foreign policy'' and 
                therefore ``naturally applies to United States policy 
                toward Hong Kong'';
                    (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong 
                are of great importance to the United States and are 
                directly relevant to United States interests in Hong 
                Kong [and] serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued 
                economic prosperity''; and
                    (D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous 
                from the People's Republic of China to ``justify 
                treatment under a particular law of the United States, 
                or any provision thereof, different from that accorded 
                the People's Republic of China'';
            (2) to support the high degree of autonomy and fundamental 
        rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as enumerated 
        by--
                    (A) the Joint Declaration of the Government of the 
                United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 
                the Government of the People's Republic of China on the 
                Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 
                (referred to in this Act as the ``Joint Declaration'');
                    (B) the International Covenant on Civil and 
                Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966; 
                and
                    (C) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done 
                at Paris December 10, 1948;
            (3) to support the democratic aspirations of the people of 
        Hong Kong, including the ``ultimate aim'' of the selection of 
        the Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council 
        by universal suffrage, as articulated in the Basic Law of the 
        Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic 
        of China (referred to in this Act as the ``Basic Law'');

[[Page 133 STAT. 1163]]

            (4) to urge the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong, including allowing the 
        people of Hong Kong to govern Hong Kong with a high degree of 
        autonomy and without undue interference, and ensuring that Hong 
        Kong voters freely enjoy the right to elect the Chief Executive 
        and all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council by 
        universal suffrage;
            (5) to support the establishment of a genuine democratic 
        option to freely and fairly nominate and elect the Chief 
        Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment by 2020 of open 
        and direct democratic elections for all members of the Hong Kong 
        Legislative Council;
            (6) to support the robust exercise by residents of Hong Kong 
        of the rights to free speech, the press, and other fundamental 
        freedoms, as provided by the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, 
        and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
            (7) to support freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, 
        detention, or imprisonment for all Hong Kong residents, as 
        provided by the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
            (8) to draw international attention to any violations by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China of the fundamental 
        rights of the people of Hong Kong, as provided by the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and any 
        encroachment upon the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong by the 
        Basic Law and the Joint Declaration;
            (9) to protect United States citizens and long-term 
        permanent residents living in Hong Kong, as well as people 
        visiting and transiting through Hong Kong;
            (10) to maintain the economic and cultural ties that provide 
        significant benefits to both the United States and Hong Kong; 
        and
            (11) to coordinate with allies, including the United 
        Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, to 
        promote democracy and human rights in Hong Kong.
