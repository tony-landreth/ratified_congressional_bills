    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) modernize reporting by recipients of Federal grants and 
        cooperative agreements by creating and imposing data standards 
        for the information that those recipients are required by law to 
        report to the Federal Government;
            (2) implement the recommendation by the Director of the 
        Office of Management and Budget contained in the report 
        submitted under section 5(b)(6) of the Federal Funding 
        Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 
        note) relating to the development of a ``comprehensive taxonomy 
        of standard definitions for core data elements required for 
        managing Federal financial assistance awards'';
            (3) reduce burden and compliance costs of recipients of 
        Federal grants and cooperative agreements by enabling technology 
        solutions, existing or yet to be developed, for use in both the 
        public and private sectors to better manage the data that 
        recipients already provide to the Federal Government; and
            (4) strengthen oversight and management of Federal grants 
        and cooperative agreements by agencies by consolidating the 
        collection and display of and access to open data that has been 
        standardized and, where appropriate, increasing transparency to 
        the public.
