    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. TRANSFER AUTHORITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) lead is a toxic chemical that--
                    (A) is particularly harmful to young children; and
                    (B) can cause reduced intelligence quotients, 
                attention disorders, and other serious health problems;
            (2) excessive and harmful levels of lead have been found in 
        water systems across all 50 States and those water systems serve 
        drinking water to millions of people in the United States;
            (3) hundreds of the water systems described in paragraph (2) 
        are water systems that provide drinking water to schools or day 
        care centers;
            (4) not all States have sufficient funds in the drinking 
        water revolving fund of that State to address the threat to 
        public health from heightened exposure to lead in drinking 
        water; and
            (5) some States have available funds in the clean water 
        revolving fund of that State that could be used to provide 
        additional resources to help address lead in drinking water.

    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Clean water revolving fund.--The term ``clean water 
        revolving fund'' means a State water pollution control revolving 
        fund established under title VI of the Federal Water Pollution 
        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.).
            (2) Drinking water revolving fund.--The term ``drinking 
        water revolving fund'' means a State drinking water treatment 
        revolving loan fund established under section 1452 of the Safe 
        Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12).

    (c) Authority.-- <<NOTE: Time 
period. Consultation. Determination.>> In addition to the transfer 
authority in section 302(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 
1996 (42 U.S.C. 300j-12 note; Public Law 104-182), and notwithstanding 
section 1452(d) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12(d)), 
during the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, 
if a State, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, determines that available funds in the clean water 
revolving fund of the State are necessary to address a threat to public 
health as a result of heightened exposure to lead in drinking water, the 
State may transfer an
