        Procedure, or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

        district judge upon a day certain to show cause why that person 
        should not be adjudged in contempt by reason of the facts so 
        certified. The district judge shall thereupon hear the evidence 
        as to the act or conduct complained of and, if it is such as to 
        warrant punishment, punish such person in the same manner and to 
        the same extent as for a contempt committed before a district 
        judge.
