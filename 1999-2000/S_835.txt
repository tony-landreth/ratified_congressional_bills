        project selected by the Secretary must--
                    (A) address restoration needs identified in an 
                estuary habitat restoration plan;
                    (B) be consistent with the estuary habitat 
                restoration strategy developed under section 106;

                local government agencies.
                    (E) Whether the project fosters public-private 
                partnerships and uses Federal resources to encourage 
                increased private sector involvement, including 
                consideration of the amount of private funds or in-kind 
                contributions for an estuary habitat restoration 
                activity.
                    (F) Whether the project is cost-effective.
                    (G) Whether the State in which the non-Federal 
                interest is proposing the project has a dedicated source 
                of funding to acquire or restore estuary habitat, 
                natural areas, and open spaces for the benefit of 
                estuary habitat restoration or protection.
                    (H) Other factors that the Secretary determines to 
                be reasonable and necessary for consideration.
            (4) Priority.--In selecting estuary habitat restoration 
        projects to be carried out under this title, the Secretary shall 
        give priority consideration to a project if, in addition to 
        meriting selection based on the factors under paragraph (3)--
                    (A) the project occurs within a watershed in which 
                there is a program being carried out that addresses 
                sources of pollution and other activities that otherwise 
                would re-impair the restored habitat; or
                    (B) the project includes pilot testing of or a 
                demonstration of an innovative technology having the 
                potential for improved cost-effectiveness in estuary

        an estuary habitat restoration project carried out under this 
        title shall include lands, easements, rights-of-way, and 
        relocations and may include services, or any other form of in-
        kind contribution determined by the Secretary to be an 
        appropriate contribution equivalent to the monetary amount 
        required for the non-Federal share of the activity.
            (4) Operation and maintenance.--The non-Federal interests 
        shall be responsible for all costs associated with operating, 
        maintaining, replacing, repairing, and rehabilitating all

    (f) Cooperation of Non-Federal Interests.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may not carry out an estuary 
        habitat restoration project until a non-Federal interest has

        non-Federal interest agrees to--
                    (A) provide all lands, easements, rights-of-way, and 
                relocations and any other elements the Secretary

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and a resource 
        of worldwide significance;
            (2) over many years, the productivity and water quality of 
        the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed were diminished by 
        pollution, excessive sedimentation, shoreline erosion, the 
        impacts of population growth and development in the Chesapeake 
        Bay watershed, and other factors;
            (3) the Federal Government (acting through the Administrator 
        of the Environmental Protection Agency), the Governor of the

        the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the 
        Chairperson of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the mayor of 
        the District of Columbia, as Chesapeake Bay Agreement 
        signatories, have committed to a comprehensive cooperative 
        program to achieve improved water quality and improvements in 
        the productivity of living resources of the Bay;
            (4) the cooperative program described in paragraph (3) 
        serves as a national and international model for the management 
        of estuaries; and
            (5) there is a need to expand Federal support for 
        monitoring, management, and restoration activities in the 
        Chesapeake Bay and the tributaries of the Bay in order to meet 
        and further the original and subsequent goals and commitments of 
        the Chesapeake Bay Program.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to expand and strengthen cooperative efforts to restore 
        and protect the Chesapeake Bay; and
            (2) to achieve the goals established in the Chesapeake Bay 
        Agreement.
