106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
 To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to contract with the Mancos 
  Water Conservancy District to use the Mancos Project facilities for 
impounding, storage, diverting, and carriage of nonproject water for the 
 purpose of irrigation, domestic, municipal, industrial, and any other 
       beneficial purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 19, 2000 -  [S. 2594]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. CARRIAGE OF NONPROJECT WATER BY THE MANCOS PROJECT, 
                            COLORADO.

    (a) Sale of Excess Water.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out the Act of August 11, 1939 
        (commonly known as the ``Water Conservation and Utilization 
        Act'') (16 U.S.C. 590y et seq.), if storage or carrying capacity 
        has been or may be provided in excess of the requirements of the 
        land to be irrigated under the Mancos Project, Colorado 
        (referred to in this Act as the ``project''), the Secretary of 
        the Interior may, on such terms as the Secretary determines to 
        be just and equitable, contract with the Mancos Water 
        Conservancy District and any of its member unit contractors for 
        impounding, storage, diverting, or carriage of nonproject water 
        for irrigation, domestic, municipal, industrial, and any other 
        beneficial purposes, to an extent not exceeding the excess 
        capacity.
            (2) Interference.--A contract under paragraph (1) shall not 
        impair or otherwise interfere with any authorized purpose of the 
        project.
            (3) Cost considerations.--In fixing the charges under a 
        contract under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
        consideration--
                    (A) the cost of construction and maintenance of the 
                project, by which the nonproject water is to be 
                diverted, impounded, stored, or carried; and
                    (B) the canal by which the water is to be carried.
            (4) No additional charges.--The Mancos Water Conservancy 
        District shall not impose a charge for the storage, carriage, or 
        delivery of the nonproject water in excess of the charge paid to 
        the United States, except to such extent as may be reasonably 
        necessary to cover--
                    (A) a proportionate share of the project cost; and
                    (B) the cost of carriage and delivery of the 
                nonproject water through the facilities of the Mancos 
                Water Conservancy District.

    (b) Water Rights of United States Not Enlarged.--Nothing in this Act 
enlarges or attempts to enlarge the right of the United States, under 
existing law, to control any water in any State.

    Approved December 19, 2000.
