Public Law 106-1
106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
 To restore the management and personnel authority of the Mayor of the 
       District of Columbia. <<NOTE: Mar. 5, 1999 -  [H.R. 433]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: District of 
Columbia Management Restoration Act of 1999.>> 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``District of Columbia Management 
Restoration Act of 1999''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Among the major problems of the District of Columbia 
        government has been the failure to clearly delineate 
        accountability.
            (2) The statute establishing the District of Columbia 
        Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority 
        proved necessary to enable the District to regain financial 
        stability and management control.
            (3) The District has performed significantly better than the 
        Congress had anticipated at the time of the passage of the 
        Authority statute.
            (4) The necessity for a financial authority has resulted in 
        a diffusion of responsibility between the Mayor, the Council, 
        and the Authority pending the time when the District government 
        would assume the home rule status quo ante.
            (5) This lack of clear lines of reporting authority, in 
        turn, has led to some redundancy and confusion about 
        accountability and authority.
            (6) The Authority statute requires the Authority to ``ensure 
        the most efficient and effective delivery of services, including 
        public safety services, by the District government'' and to 
        ``assist the District government in * * * ensuring the 
        appropriate and efficient delivery of services''.
            (7) <<NOTE: Anthony Williams.>> With the coming of a new 
        administration led by Mayor Anthony Williams, the Authority has 
        taken the first step to ensure the accountability that will be 
        necessary at the expiration of the control period by delegating 
        day-to-day operations over city agencies previously under 
        control of the Authority to the Mayor.
            (8) The Congress agrees that the best way to ensure clear 
        and unambiguous authority and full accountability is for the 
        Mayor to have full authority over city agencies so that 
        citizens, the Authority, and the Congress can ascertain 
        responsibility.

[[Page 113 STAT. 4]]

            (9) The transition of authority to the new administration 
        will take nothing from the Authority's power to intervene during 
        a control period.

SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL AUTHORITY OF MAYOR OF 
            THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

    (a) In General.--Subtitle B of title XI of the Balanced Budget Act 
of 1997 (D.C. Code, sec. 47-395.1 et seq.) is repealed.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1604(f )(2)(B) of the Taxpayer 
Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-34; 111 Stat. 1099) is repealed.

    Approved March 5, 1999.
