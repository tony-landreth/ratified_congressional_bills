SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should 
        continue to pursue actions and reforms directed at reducing 
        institutional costs, including management restructuring, 
        facility consolidation, procurement reform, and convergence with 
        defense and commercial sector systems, while sustaining safety 
        standards for personnel and hardware.
            (2) The United States is on the verge of creating and using 
        new technologies in microsatellites, information processing, and 
        space transportation that could radically alter the manner in 
        which the Federal Government approaches its space mission.
            (3) The overwhelming preponderance of the Federal 
        Government's requirements for routine, unmanned space 
        transportation can be met most effectively, efficiently, and 
        economically by a free and competitive market in privately 
        developed and operated space transportation services.
            (4) In formulating a national space transportation service 
        policy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should 
        aggressively promote the pursuit by commercial providers of the 
        development of advanced space transportation technologies 
        including reusable space vehicles and human space systems.
            (5) The Federal Government should invest in the types of 
        research and innovative technology in which United States 
        commercial providers do not invest, while avoiding competition 
        with the activities in which United States commercial providers 
        do invest.
            (6) International cooperation in space exploration and 
        science activities most effectively serves the United States 
        national interest--
                    (A) when it--
                          (i) reduces the cost of undertaking missions 
                      the United States Government would pursue 
                      unilaterally;
                          (ii) enables the United States to pursue 
                      missions that it could not otherwise afford to 
                      pursue unilaterally; or
                          (iii) enhances United States capabilities to 
                      use and develop space for the benefit of United 
                      States citizens; and
                    (B) when it--

[[Page 114 STAT. 1579]]

                          (i) is undertaken in a manner that is 
                      sensitive to the desire of United States 
                      commercial providers to develop or explore space 
                      commercially;
                          (ii) is consistent with the need for Federal 
                      agencies to use space to complete their missions; 
                      and
                          (iii) is carried out in a manner consistent 
                      with United States export control laws.
            (7) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and 
        the Department of Defense should cooperate more effectively in 
        leveraging the mutual capabilities of these agencies to conduct 
        joint aeronautics and space missions that not only improve 
        United States aeronautics and space capabilities, but also 
        reduce the cost of conducting those missions.
            (8) The space shuttle will remain for the foreseeable future 
        the Nation's only means of safe and reliable crewed access to 
        space. As a result, the Congress is committed to funding 
        upgrades designed to improve the shuttle's safety and 
        reliability. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        should continue to provide appropriate levels of funding in its 
        annual budget requests to meet the schedule for completing the 
        high-priority upgrades in a timely manner.
            (9) The Deep Space Network will continue to be a critically 
        important part of the Nation's scientific and exploration 
        infrastructure in the coming decades, and the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration should ensure that the 
        Network is adequately maintained and that upgrades required to 
        support future missions are undertaken in a timely manner.
            (10) The Hubble Space Telescope has proven to be an 
        important national astronomical research facility that is 
        revolutionizing our understanding of the universe and should be 
        kept productive, and its capabilities should be maintained and 
        enhanced as appropriate to serve as a scientific bridge to the 
        next generation of space-based observatories.
            (11) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is to 
        be commended for its successful efforts to transfer mobile 
        robotics technologies to the United States industry through its 
        existing 5-year commitment to the National Robotics Engineering 
        Consortium (NREC). One of the attractive features of this 
        activity has been NREC's ability to attract private sector 
        matching funds for its government-sponsored projects. The 
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration should give strong 
        consideration to a continuation of its commitment to NREC after 
        the current agreement expires.
