                       TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 101. <<NOTE: 15 USC 657b note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Veterans of the United States Armed Forces have been and 
        continue to be vital to the small business enterprises of the 
        United States.
            (2) In serving the United States, veterans often faced great 
        risks to preserve the American dream of freedom and prosperity.
            (3) The United States has done too little to assist 
        veterans, particularly service-disabled veterans, in playing a 
        greater role in the economy of the United States by forming and 
        expanding small business enterprises.
            (4) Medical advances and new medical technologies have made 
        it possible for service-disabled veterans to play a much more 
        active role in the formation and expansion of small business 
        enterprises in the United States.
            (5) The United States must provide additional assistance and 
        support to veterans to better equip them to form and expand 
        small business enterprises, thereby enabling them to realize the 
        American dream that they fought to protect.

SEC. <<NOTE: 15 USC 657b note.>> 102. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to expand existing and establish new 
assistance programs for veterans who own or operate small businesses. 
This Act accomplishes this purpose by--
            (1) expanding the eligibility for certain small business 
        assistance programs to include veterans;
            (2) directing certain departments and agencies of the United 
        States to take actions that enhance small business assistance to 
        veterans; and
            (3) establishing new institutions to provide small business 
        assistance to veterans or to support the institutions that 
        provide such assistance.
