insurance coverage under this chapter for such individual.

offered under this chapter unless--
            ``(1) the only coverage provided is under qualified long-
        term care insurance contracts; and
            ``(2) each insurance contract under which any such coverage 
        is provided is issued by a qualified carrier.

    ``(c) Documentation Requirement.--As a condition for obtaining long-
term care insurance coverage under this chapter based on one's status as 
a qualified relative, an applicant shall provide documentation to 
demonstrate the relationship, as prescribed by the Office.
    ``(d) Underwriting Standards.--
            ``(1) Disqualifying condition.--Nothing in this chapter 
        shall be considered to require that long-term care insurance

        would be eligible for benefits immediately.

        standards, a spouse of an individual described in paragraph (1),

        practicable, be treated like that individual.
            ``(3) Guaranteed issue.--Nothing in this chapter shall be 
        considered to require that long-term care insurance coverage be 
        guaranteed to an eligible individual.
            ``(4) Requirement that contract be fully insured.--In 
        addition to the requirements otherwise applicable under section 
        9001(9), in order to be considered a qualified long-term care

        be fully insured, whether through reinsurance with other 
        companies or otherwise.
            ``(5) Higher standards allowable.--Nothing in this chapter 
        shall, in the case of an individual applying for long-term care 
        insurance coverage under this chapter after the expiration of 
        such individual's first opportunity to enroll, preclude the 
        application of underwriting standards more stringent than those 
        that would have applied if that opportunity had not yet expired.

    ``(e) Guaranteed Renewability.--The benefits and coverage made 
available to eligible individuals under any insurance contract under 
this chapter shall be guaranteed renewable (as defined by section 7A(2) 
of the model regulations described in section 7702B(g)(2) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986), including the right to have insurance 
remain in effect so long as premiums continue to be timely made. 
However, the authority to revise premiums under this chapter shall be 
available only on a class basis and only to the extent otherwise 
allowable under section 9003(b).

    ``(a) In General.--The Office of Personnel Management shall, without 
regard to section 5 of title 41 or any other statute requiring

                in

[[Page 114 STAT. 775]]

SEC. 2205. <<NOTE: 5 USC 8331 note.>>  THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN TREATMENT FOR 
            CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Applicability.--This section applies to an individual who--
            (1) is eligible to make an election of coverage under 
        section 2101 or 2102, and only if FERS coverage is elected (or 
        remains in effect) for the employee involved; or
            (2) is described in section 2111, and makes or has made 
        retroactive employee contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund 
        under regulations prescribed by the Executive Director.

    (b) Payment Into Thrift Savings Fund.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Payment.--With respect to an individual to whom 
                this section applies, the employing agency shall pay to 
                the Thrift Savings Fund under subchapter III of chapter 
                84 of title 5, United States Code, for credit to the 
                account of the employee involved, an amount equal to the 
                earnings which are disallowed under section 8432a(a)(2) 
                of such title on the employee's retroactive 
                contributions to such Fund.
                    (B) Amount.--Earnings under subparagraph (A) shall 
                be computed in accordance with the procedures for 
                computing lost earnings under section 8432a of title 5, 
                United States Code. The amount paid by the employing 
                agency shall be treated for all purposes as if that 
                amount had actually been earned on the basis of the 
                employee's contributions.
                    (C) Exceptions.--If an individual made retroactive 
                contributions before the effective date of the 
                regulations

[[Page 114 STAT. 783]]

                under section 2101(c), the Director may provide for an 
                alternative calculation of lost earnings to the extent 
                that a calculation under subparagraph (B) is not 
                administratively feasible. The alternative calculation 
                shall yield an amount that is as close as practicable to 
                the amount computed under subparagraph (B), taking into 
                account earnings previously paid.
            (2) Additional employee contribution.--In cases in which the 
        retirement coverage error was corrected before the effective 
        date of the regulations under section 2101(c), the employee 
        involved shall have an additional opportunity to make 
        retroactive contributions for the period of the retirement 
        coverage error (subject to applicable limits), and such 
        contributions (including any contributions made after the date 
        of the correction) shall be treated in accordance with paragraph 
        (1).

    (c) Regulations.--
            (1) Executive director.--The Executive Director shall 
        prescribe regulations appropriate to carry out this section 
        relating to retroactive employee contributions and payments made 
        on or after the effective date of the regulations under section 
        2101(c).
            (2) Office.--The Office, in consultation with the Federal 
        Retirement Thrift Investment Board, shall prescribe regulations 
        appropriate to carry out this section relating to the 
        calculation of lost earnings on retroactive employee 
        contributions made before the effective date of the regulations 
        under section 2101(c).

        annuitant) who makes an election to correct a retirement 
        coverage error under this title, that the Office determines to 
        be excess as a result of such election.

    (b) Additional Employee Retirement Deductions To Be Paid by 
Agency.--If a correction in a retirement coverage error results in an 
increase in employee deductions under section 8334 or 8422 of title 5, 
United States Code, that cannot be fully paid by a reallocation of 
otherwise available amounts previously deducted from the employee's pay 
as employment taxes or retirement deductions, the employing agency--
            (1) shall pay the required additional amount into the CSRDF; 
        and
            (2) shall not seek repayment of that amount from the
