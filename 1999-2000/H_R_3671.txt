 TITLE III--NATIONAL <<NOTE: National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial 
Act.>> WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM CENTENNIAL

SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 16 USC 668dd note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``National Wildlife Refuge System 
Centennial Act''.

SEC. 302. <<NOTE: 16 USC 668dd note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) President Theodore Roosevelt began the National Wildlife 
        Refuge System by establishing the first refuge at Pelican 
        Island, Florida, on March 14, 1903;
            (2) the National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of more 
        than 93,000,000 acres of Federal land managed by the United 
        States Fish and Wildlife Service in more than 532 individual 
        refuges and thousands of waterfowl production areas located in 
        all 50 States and the territories of the United States;
            (3) the System is the only network of Federal land dedicated 
        singularly to wildlife conservation and where wildlife-dependent 
        recreation and environmental education are priority public uses;
            (4) the System serves a vital role in the conservation of 
        millions of migratory birds, dozens of endangered species and 
        threatened species, some of the premier fisheries of the United 
        States, marine mammals, and the habitats on which such species 
        of fish and wildlife depend;
            (5) each year the System provides millions of Americans with 
        opportunities to participate in wildlife-dependent recreation, 
        including hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation;
            (6)(A) public visitation to national wildlife refuges is 
        growing, with more than 35,000,000 visitors annually; and
            (B) it is essential that visitor centers and public use 
        facilities be properly constructed, operated, and maintained;
            (7) the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and 
        Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 742f 
        note; Public Law 105-242), and the amendments made by that Act, 
        significantly enhance the ability of the United States Fish and 
        Wildlife Service to incorporate volunteers and partnerships in 
        refuge management;
            (8) as of the date of the enactment of this Act, the System 
        has an unacceptable backlog of critical operation and 
        maintenance needs; and
            (9) the occasion of the centennial of the System, in 2003, 
        presents a historic opportunity to enhance natural resource 
        stewardship and expand public enjoyment of the national wildlife 
        refuges of the United States.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to establish a commission to promote awareness by the 
        public of the National Wildlife Refuge System as the System 
        celebrates its centennial in 2003;
            (2) to develop a long-term plan to meet the priority 
        operation, maintenance, and construction needs of the System;

[[Page 114 STAT. 1783]]

            (3) to require an annual report on the needs of the System 
        prepared in the context of--
                    (A) the budget submission of the Department of the 
                Interior to the President; and
                    (B) the President's budget request to Congress; and
            (4) to improve public use programs and facilities of the 
        System to meet the increasing needs of the public for wildlife-
        dependent recreation in the 21st century.
