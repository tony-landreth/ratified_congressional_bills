   CHAPTER 2--SPECIAL <<NOTE: Product Development and Testing Act of 
2000.>> CLASSIFICATION RELATING TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

SEC. 1431. SHORT TITLE.

    This chapter may be cited as the ``Product Development and Testing 
Act of 2000''.

SEC. 1432. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1)(A) A substantial amount of development and testing 
        occurs in the United States incident to the introduction and 
        manufacture of new products for both domestic consumption and 
        export overseas.
            (B) Testing also occurs with respect to merchandise that has 
        already been introduced into commerce to insure that it 
        continues to meet specifications and performs as designed.
            (2) The development and testing that occurs in the United 
        States incident to the introduction and manufacture of new 
        products, and with respect to products which have already been 
        introduced into commerce, represents a significant industrial 
        activity employing highly-skilled workers in the United States.
            (3)(A) Under the current laws affecting the importation of 
        merchandise, such as the provisions of part I of title IV of the 
        Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), goods commonly 
        referred to as ``prototypes'', used for product development 
        testing and product evaluation purposes, are subject to customs 
        duty upon their importation into the United States unless the 
        prototypes qualify for duty-free treatment under special trade 
        programs or unless the prototypes are entered under a temporary 
        importation bond.
            (B) In addition, the United States Customs Service has 
        determined that the value of prototypes is to be included in the 
        value of production articles if the prototypes are the result of 
        the same design and development effort as the articles.
            (4)(A) Assessing duty on prototypes twice, once when the 
        prototypes are imported and a second time thereafter as part of 
        the cost of imported production merchandise, discourages 
        development and testing in the United States, and thus 
        encourages development and testing to occur overseas, since, in 
        that case, duty will only be assessed once, upon the importation 
        of production merchandise.
            (B) Assessing duty on these prototypes twice unnecessarily 
        inflates the cost to businesses, thus reducing their 
        competitiveness.
            (5) Current methods for avoiding the excessive assessment of 
        customs duties on the importation of prototypes, including the 
        use of temporary importation entries and obtaining drawback, are 
        unwieldy, ineffective, and difficult for both importers and the 
        United States Customs Service to administer.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this chapter is to promote product 
development and testing in the United States by permitting the 
importation of prototypes on a duty-free basis.

                           purposes..........


    (b) U.S. Note.--The U.S. Notes to subchapter XVII of chapter 98 are 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``6. The following provisions apply to heading 9817.85.01:
``(a) For purposes of this subchapter, including heading 9817.85.01, the 
    term `prototypes' means originals or models of articles that--
``(i) are either in the preproduction, production, or postproduction 
    stage and are to be used exclusively for development, testing, 
    product evaluation, or quality control purposes; and
``(ii) in the case of originals or models of articles that are either in 
    the production or postproduction stage, are associated with a design 
    change from current production (including a refinement, advancement, 
    improvement, development, or quality control in either the product 
    itself or the means for producing the product).
For purposes of clause (i), automobile racing for purse, prize, or 
    commercial competition shall not be considered to be ``development, 
    testing, product evaluation, or quality control.''.
``(b)(i) Prototypes may be imported only in limited noncommercial 
    quantities in accordance with industry practice.
``(ii) Except as provided for by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
    prototypes or parts of prototypes may not be sold after importation 
    into the United States or be incorporated into other products that 
    are sold.
``(c) Articles subject to quantitative restrictions, antidumping orders, 
    or countervailing duty orders may not be classified as prototypes 
    under this note. Articles subject to licensing requirements, or 
    which must comply with laws, rules, or regulations administered by 
    agencies other than the United States Customs Service before being 
    imported, may be classified as prototypes if they comply with all 
    applicable provisions of law and otherwise meet the definition of 
    `prototypes' under paragraph (a).''.

 SEC. 1434. REGULATIONS RELATING TO ENTRY PROCEDURES AND SALES OF 
            PROTOTYPES.

    CHAPTER 3--PROHIBITION ON <<NOTE: Dog and Cat Protection Act of 
2000.>> IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH DOG OR CAT FUR

SEC. 1441. <<NOTE: 19 USC 1654 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This chapter may be cited as the ``Dog and Cat Protection Act of 
2000''.

SEC. 1442. <<NOTE: 19 USC 1308 note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered and 
        sold annually as part of the international fur trade. 
        Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of 
        products, including fur coats and jackets, fur trimmed garments, 
        hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed animals, and other 
        toys.
            (2) The United States represents one of the largest markets 
        for the sale of fur and fur products in the world. Market demand 
        for fur products in the United States has led to the 
        introduction of dog and cat fur products into United States 
        commerce, frequently based on deceptive or fraudulent labeling 
        of the products to disguise the true nature of the fur and 
        mislead United States wholesalers, retailers, and consumers.
            (3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily 
        distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs 
        such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink, and synthetic 
        materials made to resemble real fur. Dog and cat fur is 
        generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be used 
        as a substitute for more expensive types of furs, which provides 
        an incentive to engage in unfair or fraudulent trade practices 
        in the importation, exportation, distribution, or sale of fur 
        products, including deceptive labeling and other practices 
        designed to disguise the true contents or origin of the product.
            (4) Forensic texts have documented that dog and cat fur 
        products are being imported into the United States subject to 
        deceptive labels or other practices designed to conceal the use 
        of dog or cat fur in the production of wearing apparel, toys, 
        and other products.
            (5) Publicly available evidence reflects ongoing significant 
        use of dogs and cats bred expressly for their fur by foreign fur 
        producers for manufacture into wearing apparel, toys, and other 
        products that have been introduced into United States commerce. 
        The evidence indicates that foreign fur producers also rely on 
        the use of stray dogs and cats and stolen pets for the 
        manufacture of fur products destined for the world and United 
        States markets.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2164]]

            (6) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering 
        dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and 
        inhumane.
            (7) The trade of dog and cat fur products is ethically and 
        aesthetically abhorrent to United States citizens. Consumers in 
        the United States have a right to know if products offered for 
        sale contain dog or cat fur and to ensure that they are not 
        unwitting participants in this gruesome trade.
            (8) Persons who engage in the sale of dog or cat fur 
        products, including the fraudulent trade practices identified 
        above, gain an unfair competitive advantage over persons who 
        engage in legitimate trade in apparel, toys, and other products, 
        and derive an unfair benefit from consumers who buy their 
        products.
            (9) The imposition of a ban on the sale, manufacture, offer 
        for sale, transportation, and distribution of dog and cat fur 
        products, regardless of their source, is consistent with the 
        international obligations of the United States because it 
        applies equally to domestic and foreign producers and avoids any 
        discrimination among foreign sources of competing products. Such 
        a ban is also consistent with provisions of international 
        agreements to which the United States is a party that expressly 
        allow for measures designed to protect the health and welfare of 
        animals and to enjoin the use of deceptive trade practices in 
        international or domestic commerce.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this chapter are to--
            (1) prohibit imports, exports, sale, manufacture, offer for 
        sale, transportation, and distribution in the United States of 
        dog and cat fur products, in order to ensure that United States 
        market demand does not provide an incentive to slaughter dogs or 
        cats for their fur;
            (2) require accurate labeling of fur species so that 
        consumers in the United States can make informed choices and 
        ensure that they are not unwitting contributors to this gruesome 
        trade; and
            (3) ensure that the customs laws of the United States are 
        not undermined by illicit international traffic in dog and cat 
        fur products.

SEC. 1443. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS MADE WITH DOG OR CAT 
            FUR.

                and release of goods and data reporting for other 
                purposes such as collection of revenue and statistics;
                    (B) reduce to a minimum data required for

                      between the functions of collecting revenue and 
                      statistics and the function of determining the

                      each shipment of goods entering the United States;

        collected, and procedures or data requirements that could be 
        eliminated, or deferred and consolidated into periodic reports 
        such as the import activity summary statement.
            (2) The identity of data and factors necessary to determine 
        whether physical inspections should be conducted.
            (3) The cost of data collection.
            (4) Potential alternative sources and methodologies for 
        collecting data, taking into account the costs and other 
        consequences to importers, exporters, carriers, and the 
        Government of choosing alternative sources.
            (5) Recommended changes to the law, regulations of any 
        agency, or other measures that would improve the efficiency of

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Republic of the Sudan produces 60 percent of the 
        world's supply of gum arabic in raw form and has a virtual 
        monopoly on the world's supply of the highest grade of gum 
        arabic.
            (2) The President imposed comprehensive sanctions against 
        Sudan on November 3, 1997, under Executive Order No. 13067.

        since the imposition of sanctions against Sudan under Executive 
        Order No. 13067 to permit United States gum arabic processors to 
        import gum arabic in raw form from Sudan due to a lack of 
        alternative sources in other countries.
            (4) The United States gum arabic processing industry 
        consists of three small companies whose existence is threatened 
        by the comprehensive sanctions in effect against Sudan.
            (5) The United States gum arabic processing industry is 
        working with the United States Agency for International 
        Development to develop alternative sources of gum arabic in raw 
        form in countries that are not subject to sanctions, but 
        alternative sources of the highest grade of gum arabic in raw 
        form are not currently available.

    (b) License Applications to Import Gum Arabic From Sudan.--
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the 
Treasury and the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary 
of Commerce and the heads of other appropriate agencies--
            (1) shall consider promptly any license application by a 
        United States gum arabic processor to import gum arabic in raw 
        form from the Republic of the Sudan; and
            (2) in reviewing such license applications by United States 
        gum arabic processors, shall consider whether adequate 
        commercial quantities of the highest grade of gum arabic in raw 
        form are available from countries not subject to United States 
        sanctions in order to allow such United States processors of gum 
        arabic to remain in business.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2174]]

    (c) Development of Alternative Sources of Gum Arabic.--The President 
shall utilize such authority as is available to the President to promote 
the development in countries other than Sudan of alternative sources of 
the highest grade of gum arabic in raw form of sufficient commercial 
quality to be utilized in products intended for human consumption.
    (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``gum arabic in raw 
form'' means gum arabic of the type described in subheadings 1301.20.00
