Public Law 106-186
106th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
   Expressing <<NOTE: Apr. 25, 2000 -  [S.J. Res. 43]>>  the sense of 
 Congress that the President of the United States should encourage free 
          and fair elections and respect for democracy in Peru.

Whereas presidential and congressional elections are scheduled to occur 
    in Peru on April 9, 2000;
Whereas independent election monitors, including the Organization of 
    American States, the National Democratic Institute, and the Carter 
    Center, have expressed grave doubts about the fairness of the 
    electoral process due to the Peruvian Government's control of key 
    official electoral agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of 
    the press, manipulation of the judicial processes to stifle 
    independent reporting on radio, television, and newspaper outlets, 
    and harassment and intimidation of opposition politicians, which 
    have greatly limited the ability of opposing candidates to campaign 
    freely; and
Whereas the absence of free and fair elections in Peru would constitute 
    a major setback for the Peruvian people and for democracy in the 
    hemisphere, could result in instability in Peru, and could 
    jeopardize United States antinarcotics objectives in Peru and the 
    region: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of 
Congress that the President of the United States should promptly convey 
to the President of Peru that if the April 9, 2000, elections are not 
deemed by the international community to have been free and fair, the 
United States will review and modify as appropriate its political, 
economic, and military relations with Peru, and will work with other 
democracies in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a restoration of 
democracy in Peru.

    Approved April 25, 2000.
