Public Law 106-104
106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend for an additional 
  2 years the period for admission of an alien as a nonimmigrant under 
 section 101(a)(15)(S) of such Act, and to authorize appropriations for 
   the refugee assistance program under chapter 2 of title IV of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act. <<NOTE: Nov. 13, 1999 -  [H.R. 3061]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    In light of the increasing problem of alien smuggling into the 
United States, it is the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General 
should use the provision of nonimmigrant status under section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in a greater number 
of alien smuggling investigations per year than has been done in the 
past.

SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR ADMISSION OF ``S'' VISA 
            NONIMMIGRANTS.

    Section 214(k)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1184(k)(2)) is amended by striking ``5'' and inserting ``7''.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR REFUGEE ASSISTANCE.

    Section 414(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1524(a)) is amended by striking ``1998 and 1999'' and inserting ``2000 
through 2002''.

    Approved November 13, 1999.
