    To direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance in 
    planning and constructing a regional heritage center in Calais, 
              Maine. <<NOTE: Nov. 22, 2000 -  [S. 2485]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Saint Croix Island Heritage 
Act.>> assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 16 USC 450hh note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saint Croix Island Heritage Act''.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 450hh note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Saint Croix Island is located in the Saint Croix River, 
        a river that is the boundary between the State of Maine and 
        Canada;
            (2) the Island is the only international historic site in 
        the National Park System;
            (3) in 1604, French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons, 
        accompanied by a courageous group of adventurers that included 
        Samuel Champlain, landed on the Island and began the 
        construction of a settlement;
            (4) the French settlement on the Island in 1604 and 1605 was 
        the initial site of the first permanent settlement in the New 
        World, predating the English settlement of 1607 at Jamestown, 
        Virginia;
            (5) many people view the expedition that settled on the 
        Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North 
        America;
            (6) in October, 1998, the National Park Service completed a 
        general management plan to manage and interpret the Saint Croix 
        Island International Historic Site;
            (7) the plan addresses a variety of management alternatives, 
        and concludes that the best management strategy entails 
        developing an interpretive trail and ranger station at Red 
        Beach, Maine, and a regional heritage center in downtown Calais, 
        Maine, in cooperation with Federal, State, and local agencies;
            (8) a 1982 memorandum of understanding, signed by the 
        Department of the Interior and the Canadian Department for the 
        Environment, outlines a cooperative program to commemorate the 
        international heritage of the Saint Croix Island site and 
        specifically to prepare for the 400th anniversary of the 
        settlement in 2004; and

[[Page 114 STAT. 2525]]

            (9) only 4 years remain before the 400th anniversary of the 
        settlement at Saint Croix Island, an occasion that should be 
        appropriately commemorated.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the Secretary of 
the Interior to take all necessary and appropriate steps to work with 
Federal, State, and local agencies, historical societies, and nonprofit 
organizations to facilitate the development of a regional heritage 
center in downtown Calais, Maine before the 400th anniversary of the 
settlement of Saint Croix Island.
