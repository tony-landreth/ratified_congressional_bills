   TITLE I--SALT RIVER PIMA-MARICOPA INDIAN COMMUNITY IRRIGATION WORKS

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds and declares that--
            (1) it is the policy of the United States, in fulfillment of 
        its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to promote Indian 
        self-determination and economic self-sufficiency;
            (2) the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community 
        (hereinafter referred to as the ``Community'') has operated the 
        irrigation works within the Community's reservation since 
        November 1997 and is capable of fully managing the operation of 
        these irrigation works;
            (3) considering that the irrigation works, which are 
        comprised primarily of canals, ditches, irrigation wells, 
        storage reservoirs, and sump ponds located exclusively on lands 
        held in trust for the Community and allottees, have been 
        operated generally the same for over 100 years, the irrigation 
        works will continue to be used for the distribution and delivery 
        of water;
            (4) considering that the operational management of the 
        irrigation works has been carried out by the Community as 
        indicated in paragraph (2), the conveyance of ownership of such 
        works to the Community is viewed as an administrative action;
            (5) the Community's laws and regulations are in compliance 
        with section 102(b); and
            (6) in light of the foregoing and in order to--
                    (A) promote Indian self-determination, economic 
                self-sufficiency, and self-governance;
                    (B) enable the Community in its development of a 
                diverse, efficient reservation economy; and
                    (C) enable the Community to better serve the water 
                needs of the water users within the Community,
        it is appropriate in this instance that the United States convey 
        to the Community the ownership of the irrigation works.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2871]]

SEC. 102. CONVEYANCE AND OPERATION OF IRRIGATION WORKS.

    (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary of the Interior, as soon as is 
practicable after the date of the enactment of this Act, and in 
accordance with the provisions of this title and all other applicable 
law, shall convey to the Community any or all rights and interests of 
the United States in and to the irrigation works on the Community's 
reservation which were formerly operated by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1 and 3 of the Act 
of April 4, 1910 (25 U.S.C. 385) and sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Act of 
August 7, 1946 (25 U.S.C. 385a, 385b, and 385c) and any implementing 
regulations, during the period between the date of the enactment of this 
Act and the conveyance of the irrigation works by the United States to 
the Community, the Community shall operate the irrigation works under 
the provisions set forth in this title and in accordance with the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.), 
including retaining and expending operations and maintenance collections 
for irrigation works purposes. Effective upon the date of conveyance of 
the irrigation works, the Community shall have the full ownership of and 
operating authority over the irrigation works in accordance with the 
provisions of this title.
    (b) Fulfillment of Federal Trust Responsibilities.--To assure 
compliance with the Federal trust responsibilities of the United States 
to Indian tribes, individual Indians and Indians with trust allotments, 
including such trust responsibilities contained in Salt River Pima-
Maricopa Indian Community Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (Public 
Law 100-512), the Community shall operate the irrigation works 
consistent with this title and under uniform laws and regulations 
adopted by the Community for the management, regulation, and control of 
water resources on the reservation so as to assure fairness in the 
delivery of water to water users. <<NOTE: Publication.>> Such Community 
laws and regulations include currently and shall continue to include 
provisions to maintain the following requirements and standards which 
shall be published and made available to the Secretary and the Community 
at large:
            (1) Process.--A process by which members of the Community, 
        including Indian allottees, shall be provided a system of 
        distribution, allocation, control, pricing and regulation of 
        water that will provide a just and equitable distribution of 
        water so as to achieve the maximum beneficial use and 
        conservation of water in recognition of the demand on the water 
        resource, the changing uses of land and water and the varying 
        annual quantity of available Community water.
            (2) Due process.--A due process system for the consideration 
        and determination of any request by an Indian or Indian allottee 
        for distribution of water for use on his or her land, including 
        a process for appeal and adjudication of denied or disputed 
        distributions and for resolution of contested administrative 
        decisions.

    (c) Subsequent Modification of Laws and Regulations.--
If <<NOTE: Publication.>> the provisions of the Community's laws and 
regulations implementing subsection (b) only are to be modified 
subsequent to the date of the enactment of this Act by the Community, 
such proposed modifications shall be published and made available to the 
Secretary at least 120 days prior to their effective date and any 
modification that could significantly adversely affect the rights of 
allottees shall

[[Page 114 STAT. 2872]]

only become effective upon the concurrence of both the Community and the 
Secretary.

    (d) Limitations <<NOTE: Effective date.>> of Liability.--Effective 
upon the date of the enactment of this Act, the United States shall not 
be liable for damages of any kind arising out of any act, omission, or 
occurrence based on the Community's ownership or operation of the 
irrigation works, except for damages caused by acts of negligence 
committed by the United States prior to the date of the enactment of 
this Act. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to increase the 
liability of the United States beyond that currently provided in the 
Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 2671 et seq.).

    (e) Cancellation <<NOTE: Effective date.>> of Charges.--Effective 
upon the date of conveyance of the irrigation works under this section, 
any charges for construction of the irrigation works on the reservation 
of the Community that have been deferred pursuant to the Act of July 1, 
1932 (25 U.S.C. 386a) are hereby canceled.

    (f ) Project <<NOTE: Effective date.>> No Longer a BIA Project.--
Effective upon the date of conveyance of the irrigation works under this 
section, the irrigation works shall no longer be considered a Bureau of 
Indian Affairs irrigation project and the facilities will not be 
eligible for Federal benefits based solely on the fact that the 
irrigation works were formerly a Bureau of Indian Affairs irrigation 
project. Nothing in this title shall be construed to limit or reduce in 
any way the service, contracts, or funds the Community may be eligible 
to receive under other applicable Federal law.

SEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.

    Nothing in this title shall be construed to diminish the trust 
responsibility of the United States under applicable law to the Salt 
River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, to individual Indians, or to 
Indians with trust allotments within the Community's reservation.

TITLE <<NOTE: Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership Act of 2000.>> II--NATIVE 
HAWAIIAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE

SEC. 201. <<NOTE: 25 USC 4101 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Hawaiian Homelands Homeownership 
Act of 2000''.

SEC. 202. <<NOTE: 25 USC 4221 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has undertaken a responsibility to 
        promote the general welfare of the United States by--
                    (A) employing its resources to remedy the unsafe and 
                unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of 
                decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of 
                lower income; and
                    (B) developing effective partnerships with 
                governmental and private entities to accomplish the 
                objectives referred to in subparagraph (A);
            (2) the United States has a special responsibility for the 
        welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including 
        Native Hawaiians;
            (3) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes 
        Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), the United States

[[Page 114 STAT. 2873]]

        set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal territory that 
        later became the State of Hawaii in order to establish a 
        homeland for the native people of Hawaii--Native Hawaiians;
            (4) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the 
        housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of the 
        Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), 
        Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian home lands 
        have been foreclosed from participating in Federal housing 
        assistance programs available to all other eligible families in 
        the United States;
            (5) although Federal housing assistance programs have been 
        administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of Hawaii, 
        Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet need for 
        housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the United 
        States;
            (6) among the Native American population of the United 
        States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of 
        housing problems in the United States, as the percentage--
                    (A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian 
                population is 49 percent, as compared to--
                          (i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska 
                      Native households in Indian country; and
                          (ii) 27 percent for all other households in 
                      the United States; and
                    (B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population 
                is 36 percent as compared to 3 percent for all other 
                households in the United States;
            (7) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of 
        Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of the 
        Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 
        1996, as added by section 203 of this Act, eligible to reside on 
        the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as--
                    (A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native 
                Hawaiian households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 
                percent; and
                    (B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which 
                constitute 95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are 
                eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in 
                need of housing;
            (8) applying the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        guidelines--
                    (A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either 
                reside or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian 
                Home Lands have incomes that fall below the median 
                family income; and
                    (B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside 
                or who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands 
                have incomes below 30 percent of the median family 
                income;
            (9) one-third of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to 
        reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of 
        their income for shelter, and one-half of those Native Hawaiians 
        face overcrowding;
            (10) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native 
        Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside 
        on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands

[[Page 114 STAT. 2874]]

        have been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing 
        assistance programs available to other qualified residents of 
        the United States, and that a more effective means of addressing 
        their housing needs must be authorized;
            (11) consistent with the recommendations of the National 
        Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native 
        Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing 
        prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among Native 
        Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside on the 
        Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to extend the 
        Federal low-income housing assistance available to American 
        Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American Housing 
        Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et 
        seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;
            (12) under the treatymaking power of the United States, 
        Congress had the constitutional authority to confirm a treaty 
        between the United States and the government that represented 
        the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, the United States 
        recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended 
        full diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and 
        entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs 
        to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 
        1887;
            (13) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed that--
                    (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and 
                land-based link to the indigenous people who exercised 
                sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group 
                has never relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its 
                sovereign lands;
                    (B) Congress does not extend services to Native 
                Hawaiians because of their race, but because of their 
                unique status as the indigenous people of a once 
                sovereign nation as to whom the United States has 
                established a trust relationship;
                    (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to 
                administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility 
                to the State of Hawaii;
                    (D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is 
                comparable to that of American Indians; and
                    (E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United 
                States have--
                          (i) a continuing right to autonomy in their 
                      internal affairs; and
                          (ii) an ongoing right of self-determination 
                      and self-governance that has never been 
                      extinguished;
            (14) the political relationship between the United States 
        and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and 
        reaffirmed by the United States as evidenced by the inclusion of 
        Native Hawaiians in--
                    (A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 
                U.S.C. 2291 et seq.);
                    (B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 
                U.S.C. 1996 et seq.);
                    (C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act 
                (20 U.S.C. 80q et seq.);
                    (D) the Native American Graves Protection and 
                Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);

[[Page 114 STAT. 2875]]

                    (E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 
                U.S.C. 470 et seq.);
                    (F) the Native American Languages Act of 1992 (106 
                Stat. 3434);
                    (G) the American Indian, Alaska Native and Native

        the understanding of the history and culture of Sioux Indian 
        tribes;

[[Page 114 STAT. 2904]]

            (3) the establishment of a Sioux Nation Tribal Supreme Court 
        will promote economic development on reservations of the Sioux 
        Nation and provide investors that contribute to that development 
        a greater degree of certainty and confidence by--
                    (A) reconciling conflicting tribal laws; and
                    (B) strengthening tribal court systems;
            (4) the reservations of the Sioux Nation--
                    (A) contain the poorest counties in the United 
                States; and
                    (B) lack adequate tools to promote economic 
                development and the creation of jobs;
            (5) there is a need to enhance and strengthen the capacity 
        of Indian tribal governments and tribal justice systems to 
        address conflicts which impair relationships in Indian 
        communities and between Indian and non-Indian communities and 
        individuals; and
            (6) the establishment of the National Native American 
        Mediation Training Center, with the technical assistance of 
        tribal and Federal agencies, including the Community Relations 
        Service of the Department of Justice, would enhance and 
        strengthen the mediation skills that are useful in reducing 
        tensions and resolving conflicts in Indian communities and 
        between Indian and non-Indian communities and individuals.

TITLE <<NOTE: Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement 
Act.>> VI--TORRES-MARTINEZ DESERT CAHUILLA INDIANS CLAIMS SETTLEMENT

SEC. 601. <<NOTE: 25 USC 1778 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Indians Claims Settlement Act''.

SEC. 602. <<NOTE: 25 USC 1778.>> CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1876, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was 
        created, reserving a single, 640-acre section of land in the 
        Coachella Valley, California, north of the Salton Sink. The 
        Reservation was expanded in 1891 by Executive order, pursuant to 
        the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891, adding about 12,000 acres 
        to the original 640-acre reservation.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2907]]

            (2) Between 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the Colorado 
        River filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea, 
        inundating approximately 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation 
        lands.
            (3) In 1909, an additional 12,000 acres of land, 9,000 of 
        which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, were added to 
        the reservation under a Secretarial Order issued pursuant to a 
        1907 amendment of the Mission Indian Relief Act. Due to receding 
        water levels in the Salton Sea through the process of 
        evaporation, at the time of the 1909 enlargement of the 
        reservation, there were some expectations that the Salton Sea 
        would recede within a period of 25 years.
            (4) Through the present day, the majority of the lands added 
        to the reservation in 1909 remain inundated due in part to the 
        flowage of natural runoff and drainage water from the irrigation 
        systems of the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali Valleys into 
        the Salton Sea.
            (5) In addition to those lands that are inundated, there are 
        also tribal and individual Indian lands located on the perimeter 
        of the Salton Sea that are not currently irrigable due to lack 
        of proper drainage.
            (6) In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass 
        entitled ``United States of America, in its own right and on 
        behalf of Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and the 
        Allottees therein v. the Imperial Irrigation District and 
        Coachella Valley Water District'', Case No. 82-1790 K (M) 
        (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``U.S. Suit'') on 
        behalf of the Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe and affected Indian 
        allottees against the two water districts seeking damages 
        related to the inundation of tribal- and allottee-owned lands 
        and injunctive relief to prevent future discharge of water on 
        such lands.
            (7) On August 20, 1992, the Federal District Court for the 
        Southern District of California entered a judgment in the U.S. 
        Suit requiring the Coachella Valley Water District to pay 
        $212,908.41 in past and future damages and the Imperial 
        Irrigation District to pay $2,795,694.33 in past and future 
        damages in lieu of the United States request for a permanent 
        injunction against continued flooding of the submerged lands.
            (8) The United States, the Coachella Valley Water District, 
        and the Imperial Irrigation District have filed notices of 
        appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
        Circuit from the district court's judgment in the U.S. Suit 
        (Nos. 93-55389, 93-55398, and 93-55402), and the Tribe has filed 
        a notice of appeal from the district court's denial of its 
        motion to intervene as a matter of right (No. 92-55129).
            (9) The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stayed 
        further action on the appeals pending the outcome of settlement 
        negotiations.
            (10) In 1991, the Tribe brought its own lawsuit, Torres-
        Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, et al., v. Imperial Irrigation 
        District, et al., Case No. 91-1670 J (LSP) (hereafter in this 
        section referred to as the ``Indian Suit'') in the United States 
        District Court, Southern District of California, against the two 
        water districts, and amended the complaint to include as a 
        plaintiff, Mary Resvaloso, in her own right, and as class 
        representative of all other affected Indian allotment owners.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2908]]

            (11) The Indian Suit has been stayed by the district court 
        to facilitate settlement negotiations.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to facilitate and 
implement the settlement agreement negotiated and executed by the 
parties to the U.S. Suit and Indian Suit for the purpose of resolving

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Cherokee Shawnees, also known as the Loyal Shawnees, 
        are recognized as the descendants of the Shawnee Tribe which was 
        incorporated into the Cherokee Nation of Indians of Oklahoma 
        pursuant to an agreement entered into by and between the Shawnee 
        Tribe and the Cherokee Nation on June 7, 1869, and approved by 
        the President on June 9, 1869, in accordance with Article XV of 
        the July 19, 1866, Treaty between the United States and the 
        Cherokee Nation (14 Stat. 799).
            (2) The Shawnee Tribe from and after its incorporation and 
        its merger with the Cherokee Nation has continued to maintain 
        the Shawnee Tribe's separate culture, language, religion, and 
        organization, and a separate membership roll.
            (3) The Shawnee Tribe and the Cherokee Nation have concluded 
        that it is in the best interests of the Shawnee Tribe and the 
        Cherokee Nation that the Shawnee Tribe be restored to its 
        position as a separate federally recognized Indian tribe and all 
        current and historical responsibilities, jurisdiction, and 
        sovereignty as it relates to the Shawnee Tribe, the Cherokee-
        Shawnee people, and their properties everywhere, provided that 
        civil and criminal jurisdiction over Shawnee individually owned 
        restricted and trust lands, Shawnee tribal trust lands, 
        dependent Indian communities, and all other forms of Indian 
        country within the jurisdictional territory of the Cherokee 
        Nation and located within the State of Oklahoma shall remain 
        with the Cherokee Nation, unless consent is obtained by the 
        Shawnee Tribe from the Cherokee Nation to assume all or any 
        portion of such jurisdiction.
            (4) On August 12, 1996, the Tribal Council of the Cherokee 
        Nation unanimously adopted Resolution 96-09 supporting the 
        termination by the Secretary of the Interior of the 1869 
        Agreement.
            (5) On July 23, 1996, the Shawnee Tribal Business Committee 
        concurred in such resolution.
            (6) On March 13, 2000, a second resolution was adopted by 
        the Tribal Council of the Cherokee Nation (Resolution 15-00) 
        supporting the submission of this legislation to Congress for

SEC. 1102. <<NOTE: 25 USC 3401 note.>> FINDINGS, PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that have 
        participated in carrying out programs under the Indian 
        Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 
        1992 (25 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) have--
                    (A) improved the effectiveness of employment-related 
                services provided by those tribes and organizations to 
                their members;
                    (B) enabled more Indian and Alaska Native people to 
                prepare for and secure employment;
                    (C) assisted in transitioning tribal members from 
                welfare to work; and
                    (D) otherwise demonstrated the value of integrating 
                employment, training, education and related services.
                    (E) the initiatives under the Indian Employment, 
                Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 
                should be strengthened by ensuring that all Federal 
                programs that emphasize the value of work may be 
                included within a demonstration program of an Indian or 
                Alaska Native organization; and
                    (F) the initiatives under the Indian Employment, 
                Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 
                should have the benefit of the support and attention of 
                the officials with policymaking authority of--
                          (i) the Department of the Interior; or
                          (ii) other Federal agencies that administer 
                      programs covered by the Indian Employment, 
                      Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act 
                      of 1992.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to demonstrate how 
Indian tribal governments can integrate the employment, training, and 
related services they provide in order to improve the effectiveness of 
those services, reduce joblessness in Indian communities, foster 
economic development on Indian lands, and serve tribally-determined 
goals consistent with the policies of self-determination and self-
governance.

   TITLE <<NOTE: Navajo Nation Trust Land Leasing Act of 2000.>> XII--
NAVAJO NATION TRUST LAND LEASING

SEC. 1201. <<NOTE: 25 USC 415 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Navajo Nation Trust Land Leasing 
Act of 2000''.

SEC. 1202. <<NOTE: 25 USC 415 note.>> CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND 
            DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Recognizing the special relationship between the 
United States and the Navajo Nation and its members, and the Federal 
responsibility to the Navajo people, Congress finds that--
            (1) the third clause of section 8, Article I of the United 
        States Constitution provides that ``The Congress shall have 
        Power * * * to regulate Commerce * * * with Indian tribes'', 
        and, through this and other constitutional authority, Congress 
        has plenary power over Indian affairs;
            (2) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general 
        course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the 
        responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian 
        tribes and their resources;
            (3) the United States has a trust obligation to guard and 
        preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster 
        strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and 
        economic self-sufficiency;
            (4) pursuant to the first section of the Act of August 9, 
        1955 (25 U.S.C. 415), Congress conferred upon the Secretary of 
        the Interior the power to promulgate regulations governing 
        tribal leases and to approve tribal leases for tribes according 
        to regulations promulgated by the Secretary;
            (5) the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated the 
        regulations described in paragraph (4) at part 162 of title 25, 
        Code of Federal Regulations;
            (6) the requirement that the Secretary approve leases for 
        the development of Navajo trust lands has added a level of 
        review and regulation that does not apply to the development of 
        non-Indian land; and
            (7) in the global economy of the 21st Century, it is crucial 
        that individual leases of Navajo trust lands not be subject to 
        Secretarial approval and that the Navajo Nation be able to make 
        immediate decisions over the use of Navajo trust lands.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are as follows:
            (1) To establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation 
        to lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of 
        the Secretary of the Interior for individual leases, except

[[Page 114 STAT. 2934]]

        leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any 
        mineral resources.
            (2) To authorize the Navajo Nation, pursuant to tribal 
        regulations, which must be approved by the Secretary, to lease 
        Navajo trust lands without the approval of the Secretary of the 
        Interior for the individual leases, except leases for 
        exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral 
        resources.
            (3) To revitalize the distressed Navajo Reservation by 
        promoting political self-determination, and encouraging economic 
        self-sufficiency, including economic development that increases 
        productivity and the standard of living for members of the 
        Navajo Nation.
            (4) To maintain, strengthen, and protect the Navajo Nation's 
        leasing power over Navajo trust lands.
            (5) To ensure that the United States is faithfully executing 
        its trust obligation to the Navajo Nation by maintaining Federal 
        supervision through oversight of and record keeping related to 
        leases of Navajo Nation tribal trust lands.

        government whose interests could be adversely affected by a 
        tribal trust land leasing decision made by the Navajo Nation;
            ``(5) the term `Navajo Nation' means the Navajo Nation 
        government that is in existence on the date of enactment of this 
        Act or its successor;
            ``(6) the term `petition' means a written request submitted 
        to the Secretary for the review of an action (or inaction) of 
        the Navajo Nation that is claimed to be in violation of the 
        approved tribal leasing regulations;
            ``(7) the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of the 
        Interior; and
            ``(8) the term `tribal regulations' means the Navajo Nation 
        regulations enacted in accordance with Navajo Nation law and 
        approved by the Secretary.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(e)(1) Any leases by the Navajo Nation for purposes authorized 
under subsection (a), and any amendments thereto, except a lease

[[Page 114 STAT. 2935]]

for the exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral 
resources, shall not require the approval of the Secretary if the lease 
is executed under the tribal regulations approved by the Secretary under 
this subsection and the term of the lease does not exceed--
            ``(A) in the case of a business or agricultural lease, 25 
        years, except that any such lease may include an option to renew 
        for up to two additional terms, each of which may not exceed 25 
        years; and
            ``(B) in the case of a lease for public, religious, 
        educational, recreational, or residential purposes, 75 years if 
        such a term is provided for by the Navajo Nation through the 
        promulgation of regulations.

    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to individually owned Navajo 
Indian allotted land.
    ``(3) The Secretary shall have the authority to approve or 
disapprove tribal regulations referred to under paragraph (1). The 
Secretary shall approve such tribal regulations if such regulations are 
consistent with the regulations of the Secretary under subsection (a), 
and any amendments thereto, and provide for an environmental review 
process. The Secretary shall review and approve or disapprove the 
regulations of the Navajo Nation within 120 days of the submission of 
such regulations to the Secretary. Any disapproval of such regulations 
by the Secretary shall be accompanied by written documentation that sets 
forth the basis for the disapproval. Such 120-day period may be extended 
by the Secretary after consultation with the Navajo Nation.
    ``(4) If the Navajo Nation has executed a lease pursuant to tribal 
regulations under paragraph (1), the Navajo Nation shall provide the 
Secretary with--

            ``(B) in the case of regulations or a lease that permits 
        payment to be made directly to the Navajo Nation, documentation 
        of the lease payments sufficient to enable the Secretary to 
        discharge the trust responsibility of the United States under 
        paragraph (5).

    ``(5) The United States shall not be liable for losses sustained by 
any party to a lease executed pursuant to tribal regulations under 
paragraph (1), including the Navajo Nation. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed to diminish the authority of the Secretary to take 
appropriate actions, including the cancellation of a lease, in 
furtherance of the trust obligation of the United States to the Navajo 
Nation.
    ``(6)(A) An interested party may, after exhaustion of tribal 
remedies, submit, in a timely manner, a petition to the Secretary to 
review the compliance of the Navajo Nation with any regulations approved 
under this subsection. If upon such review the Secretary determines that 
the regulations were violated, the Secretary may take such action as may 
be necessary to remedy the violation, including rescinding the approval 
of the tribal regulations and reassuming responsibility for the approval 
of leases for Navajo Nation tribal trust lands.
    ``(B) If the Secretary seeks to remedy a violation described in 
subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall--
            ``(i) make a written determination with respect to the 
        regulations that have been violated;

            ``(ii) provide the Navajo Nation with a written notice of

        reassumption of the lease approval responsibility, provide the 
        Navajo Nation with a hearing on the record and a reasonable 
        opportunity to cure the alleged violation.''.
