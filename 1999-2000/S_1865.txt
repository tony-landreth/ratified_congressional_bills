    Congress finds that--
            (1) fully 16 percent of all inmates in State prisons and 
        local jails suffer from mental illness, according to a July, 
        1999 report, conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics;
            (2) between 600,000 and 700,000 mentally ill persons are 
        annually booked in jail alone, according to the American Jail 
        Association;
            (3) estimates say 25 to 40 percent of America's mentally ill 
        will come into contact with the criminal justice system, 
        according to National Alliance for the Mentally Ill;
            (4) 75 percent of mentally ill inmates have been sentenced 
        to time in prison or jail or probation at least once prior to 
        their current sentence, according to the Bureau of Justice 
        Statistics in July, 1999; and
            (5) Broward County, Florida and King County, Washington, 
        have created separate Mental Health Courts to place nonviolent 
        mentally ill offenders into judicially monitored inpatient and 
        outpatient mental health treatment programs, where appropriate, 
        with positive results.
