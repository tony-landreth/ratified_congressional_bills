                            STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior may conduct a study 
to investigate the opportunities to better manage the water resources in 
the Salmon Creek Watershed, a tributary to the Upper Columbia River 
system, Okanagoan County, Washington, so as to restore and enhance 
fishery resources (especially the endangered Upper Columbia Spring 
Chinook and Steelhead), while maintaining or improving the availability 
of water supplies for irrigation practices vital to the economic well-
being of the county.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the study under subsection (a) shall be 
to derive the benefits of and further the objectives of the 
comprehensive, independent study commissioned by the Confederated Tribes 
of the Colville Reservation and the Okanagoan Irrigation District, which 
provides a credible basis for pursuing a course of action to 
simultaneously achieve fish restoration and improved irrigation 
conservation and efficiency.
    (c) Cost Share.--The Federal Government's cost share for the 
feasibility study shall not exceed 50 percent.

    Approved November 9, 2000.
