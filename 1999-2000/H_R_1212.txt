                                 An Act


 
To protect producers of agricultural commodities who applied for a Crop 
    Revenue Coverage PLUS supplemental endorsement for the 1999 crop 
              year. <<NOTE: Apr. 1, 1999 -  [H.R. 1212]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CROP INSURANCE OPTIONS FOR PRODUCERS WHO APPLIED FOR CROP 
            REVENUE COVERAGE PLUS.

    (a) Eligible Producers.--This section applies with respect to a 
producer eligible for insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 
U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) who applied for the supplemental crop insurance 
endorsement known as Crop Revenue Coverage PLUS (referred to in this 
section as ``CRCPLUS'') for the 1999 crop year for a spring-planted 
agricultural commodity.
    (b) Additional Period for Obtaining or Transferring 
Coverage.--Notwithstanding the sales closing date for obtaining crop 
insurance coverage established under section 508(f)(2) of the Federal 
Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(f)(2)) and notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation shall provide a 
14-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, but not to 
extend beyond April 12, 1999, during which a producer described in 
subsection (a) may--
            (1) obtain from any approved insurance provider a level of 
        coverage for the agricultural commodity for which the producer 
        applied for the CRCPLUS endorsement that is equivalent to or 
        less than the level of federally reinsured coverage that the 
        producer applied for from the insurance provider that offered 
        the CRCPLUS endorsement; and
            (2) transfer to any approved insurance provider any 
        federally reinsured coverage provided for other agricultural 
        commodities of the producer by the same insurance provider that 
        offered the CRCPLUS endorsement, as determined by the 
        Corporation.

    Approved April 1, 1999.
