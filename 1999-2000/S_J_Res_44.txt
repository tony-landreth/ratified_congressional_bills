Public Law 106-205
106th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
 Supporting <<NOTE: May 26, 2000 -  [S.J. Res. 44]>>  the Day of Honor 
  2000 to honor and recognize the service of minority veterans in the 
             United States Armed Forces during World War II.

Whereas World War II was a determining event of the 20th century in that 
    it ensured the preservation and continuation of American democracy;
Whereas the United States called upon all its citizens, including the 
    most oppressed of its citizens, to provide service and sacrifice in 
    that war to achieve the Allied victory over Nazism and fascism;
Whereas the United States citizens who served in that war, many of whom 
    gave the ultimate sacrifice of their lives, included more than 
    1,200,000 African Americans, more than 300,000 Hispanic Americans, 
    more than 50,000 Asian Americans, more than 20,000 Native Americans, 
    more than 6,000 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and more 
    than 3,000 Native Alaskans;
Whereas because of invidious discrimination, many of the courageous 
    military activities of these minorities were not reported and 
    honored fully and appropriately until decades after the Allied 
    victory in World War II;
Whereas the motto of the United States, ``E Pluribus Unum'' (Out of 
    Many, One), promotes our fundamental unity as Americans and 
    acknowledges our diversity as our greatest strength; and
Whereas the Day of Honor 2000 Project has enlisted communities across 
    the United States to participate in celebrations to honor minority 
    veterans of World War II on May 25, 2000, and throughout the year 
    2000: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress--
            (1) commends the African American, Hispanic American, Asian 
        American, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, 
        Native Alaskan, and other minority veterans of the United States 
        Armed Forces who served during World War II;
            (2) especially honors those minority veterans who gave their 
        lives in service to the United States during that war;

[[Page 114 STAT. 313]]

            (3) supports the goals and ideas of the ``Day of Honor 
        2000'' in celebration and recognition of the extraordinary 
        service of all minority veterans in the United States Armed 
        Forces during World War II; and
            (4) <<NOTE: President.>>  authorizes and requests that the 
        President issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the 
        United States to honor these minority veterans with appropriate 
        programs and activities.

    Approved May 26, 2000.
