                           APPENDIX--H.R. 5408

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Floyd D. Spence 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Representative Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina was 
        elected to the House of Representatives in 1970, for service in 
        the 92d Congress, after serving in the South Carolina 
        legislature for 10 years, and he has been reelected to each 
        subsequent Congress.
            (2) Representative Spence came to Congress as a 
        distinguished veteran of service in the Armed Forces of the 
        United States.
            (3) Upon graduation from college in 1952, Representative 
        Spence was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Naval 
        Reserve. After entering active duty, he served with distinction 
        aboard the USS CARTER HALL and the USS LSM-397 during the Korean 
        War and later served as commanding officer of a Naval Reserve 
        Surface Division and as group commander of all Naval Reserve 
        units in Columbia, South Carolina. Representative Spence retired 
        from the Naval Reserve in 1988 in the grade of captain, after 41 
        years of dedicated service.
            (4) Upon election to the House of Representatives, 
        Representative Spence became a member of the Committee on Armed 
        Services of that body. During 30 years of service on that 
        committee (4 years of which were served while the committee was 
        known as the Committee on National Security), Representative 
        Spence's contributions to the national defense and security of 
        the United States have been profound and long lasting.
            (5) Representative Spence served as chairman of that 
        committee while known as the Committee on National Security 
        during the 104th and 105th Congresses and serves as chairman of 
        that committee for the 106th Congress. In addition, 
        Representative Spence served as the ranking minority member of 
        the Committee on Armed Services during the 103d Congress.
            (6) Dozens of awards from active duty and reserve military, 
        veterans service, military retiree, and industry organizations 
        and associations have recognized the distinguished character of 
        Representative Spence's service to the Nation.
            (7) Representative Spence has been a leading figure in the 
        debate over many of the most critical military readiness, health 
        care, recruiting, and retention issues currently confronting the 
        Nation's military. His concern for the men and women in uniform 
        has been unwavering, and his accomplishments in promoting and 
        gaining support for those issues that preserve

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-2]]

        the combat effectiveness, morale, and quality of life of the 
        Nation's military personnel have been unparalleled.
            (8) During his tenure as chairman of the Committee on 
        National Security and the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        House of Representatives, Representative Spence has--
                    (A) led efforts to identify and reverse the effect 
                that declining resources and rising commitments have had 
                on military quality of life for service members and 
                their families, on combat readiness, and on equipment 
                modernization, with a direct result of those diligent 
                efforts and of his willingness to be an outspoken 
                proponent for America's military being that Congress has 
                added nearly $50,000,000,000 to the President's defense 
                budgets over the past 5 years;
                    (B) been a leading proponent of the need to 
                expeditiously develop and field a national missile 
                defense to protect American citizens and forward 
                deployed military forces from growing ballistic missile 
                threats;
                    (C) advocated reversing the growing disparity 
                between actual military capability and the requirements 
                associated with the National Military Strategy; and
                    (D) led efforts in Congress to reform Department of 
                Defense acquisition and management headquarters and 
                infrastructure and business practices.
            (9) This Act is the 30th annual authorization bill for the 
        Department of Defense for which Representative Spence has taken 
        a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the House of Representatives (including 4 years 
        while that committee was known as the Committee on National 
        Security).
            (10) In light of the findings in the preceding paragraphs, 
        it is altogether fitting and proper that this Act be named in 
        honor of Representative Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina, as 
        provided in subsection (a).

            (3) Congress created the Office of Naval Research in the 
        Department of the Navy in 1946 to ensure the availability of 
        resources for research in oceanography and other fields related 
        to the missions of the Navy and Marine Corps.
            (4) The Office of Naval Research of the Department of the 
        Navy, in addition to its support of naval research within the 
        Federal Government, has also supported the conduct of 
        oceanographic and scientific research through partnerships with 
        educational and scientific institutions throughout the Nation.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-50]]

            (5) These partnerships have long been recognized as among 
        the most innovative and productive research partnerships ever 
        established by the Federal Government and have resulted in a 
        vast improvement in understanding of basic ocean processes and 
        the development of new technologies critical to the security and

            (1) applauds the commitment and dedication of the officers, 
        scientists, researchers, students, and administrators who were 
        instrumental to the program of partnerships for oceanographic 
        and scientific research between the Federal Government and 
        academic institutions, including those individuals who helped 
        forge that program before World War II, implement it during 
        World War II, and improve it throughout the Cold War;
            (2) recognizes that the Nation, in ultimately prevailing in 
        the Cold War, relied to a significant extent on research 
        supported by, and technologies developed through, those 
        partnerships and, in particular, on the superior understanding 
        of the ocean environment generated through that research;
            (3) supports efforts by the Secretary of the Navy and the 
        Chief of Naval Research to honor those individuals, who 
        contributed so greatly and unselfishly to the naval mission and 
        the national defense, through those partnerships during the 
        period beginning before World War II and continuing through the 
        end of the Cold War; and
            (4) expresses appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the 
        Office of Naval Research to support oceanographic and scientific 
        research and the development of researchers in those fields, to 
        ensure that such partnerships will continue to make important 
        contributions to the defense and the general welfare of the

        skills in manufacturing processes that are necessary to meet 
        industrial emergency planned requirements for national security 
        purposes.

        of the Department of Defense.
            (7) To the maximum extent practicable, to allow the 
        operation of these Army arsenals to be rapidly responsive to the 
        forces of free market competition.
            (8) To reduce or eliminate the cost of Government ownership 
        of these Army arsenals, including the costs of operations and

        review to the costs actually incurred to perform the function 
        after implementing the conversion, reorganization, or

the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the 
results of the monitoring performed under the system established under

        reorganization, or reengineering actions.

    ``(e) Consideration in Preparation of Future-Years Defense 
Program.--In preparing the future-years defense program under section 
221 of this title, the Secretary of Defense shall, for the fiscal years 
covered by the program, estimate and take

SEC. 375. NEW METHODOLOGY FOR PREPARING BUDGET REQUESTS TO SATISFY ARMY 
            READINESS REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Requirement for New Methodology.--The Secretary of the Army 
shall develop a new methodology for preparing budget requests for 
operation and maintenance for the Army that can be used to ensure that 
the budget requests for operation and maintenance for future fiscal 
years more accurately reflect the Army's requirements than did the

            (1) whether obsolete spare parts, rather than spare parts 
        for the latest aircraft configuration, are being procured;
            (2) whether there is insufficient sustaining system 
        technical support;
            (3) whether technical data packages and manuals are 
        obsolete;
            (4) whether there are unfunded requirements for airframe and 
        component upgrades; and

shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
results of the review under subsection (a).

SEC. 377. REPORT ON AIR FORCE SPARE AND REPAIR PARTS PROGRAM FOR C-5 
            AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There exists a significant shortfall in the Nation's 
        current strategic airlift requirement, even though strategic 
        airlift remains critical to the national security strategy of 
        the United States.
            (2) This shortfall results from the slow phase-out of C-141 
        aircraft and their replacement with C-17 aircraft and from lower 
        than optimal reliability rates for the C-5 aircraft.
            (3) One of the primary causes of these reliability rates for 
        C-5 aircraft, and especially for operational unit aircraft, is 
        the shortage of spare repair parts. Over the past 5 years, this 
        shortage has been particularly evident in the C-5 fleet.
            (4) Not Mission Capable for Supply rates for C-5 aircraft 
        have increased significantly in the period between 1997 and 
        1999. At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, for example, an average 
        of 7 to 9 C-5 aircraft were not available during that period 
        because of a lack of parts.
            (5) Average rates of cannibalization of C-5 aircraft per 100 
        sorties of such aircraft have also increased during that period 
        and are well above the Air Mobility Command standard. In any 
        given month, this means devoting additional manhours to 
        cannibalization of C-5 aircraft. At Dover Air Force Base, for 
        example, an average of 800 to 1,000 additional manhours were 
        required for cannibalization of C-5 aircraft during that period. 
        Cannibalization is often required for aircraft that transit 
        through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those 
        that are based there.
            (6) High cannibalization rates indicate a significant 
        problem in delivering spare parts in a timely manner and 
        systemic problems within the repair and maintenance process, and 
        also demoralize overworked maintenance crews.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-84]]

            (7) The C-5 aircraft remains an absolutely critical asset in 
        air mobility and airlifting heavy equipment and personnel to 
        both military contingencies and humanitarian relief efforts 
        around the world.
            (8) Despite increased funding for spare and repair parts and 
        other efforts by the Air Force to mitigate the parts shortage 
        problem, Congress continues to receive reports of significant 
        cannibalization to airworthy C-5 aircraft and parts backlogs.

    (b) Report Required.--Not later than January 1, 2001, and September 
30, 2001, the Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to Congress a 
report on the overall status of the spare and repair parts program of 
the Air Force for the C-5 aircraft.
    (c) Elements of Report.--Each report shall include the following:
            (1) A statement of the funds currently allocated to the 
        acquisition of spare and repair parts for the C-5 aircraft and 
        the adequacy of such funds to meet current and future repair and 
        maintenance requirements for that aircraft.
            (2) A description of current efforts to address shortfalls 
        in the availability of spare and repair parts for the C-5 
        aircraft, including an assessment of potential short-term and 
        long-term effects of such efforts.
            (3) An assessment of the effects of such parts shortfalls on 
        readiness and reliability ratings for the C-5 aircraft.
            (4) A description of rates at which spare and repair parts 
        for one C-5 aircraft are taken from another C-5 aircraft (known 
        as parts cannibalization) and the manhours devoted to part 
        cannibalization of such aircraft.
            (5) An assessment of the effects of parts shortfalls and 
        parts cannibalization with respect to C-5 aircraft on readiness 
        and retention.

        support of the reserves is different.
            (B) The grade structure authorized for senior enlisted

        States Code.
            (D) The advantages and disadvantage of replacing management 
        by the current grade tables in those sections with management 
        through a system based on the grade authorized for the position 
        occupied by the member.
            (E) The current mix within each reserve component, for each 
        controlled grade, of (i) traditional reservists, (ii) military

        program in which defense industry employees may be enrolled

        schools and concentrates on defense product development 
        functions that are conducted by military organizations and

school, students enrolled under this section, to the extent practicable, 
are subject to the same regulations governing academic performance,

evaluation of the admission of such students under that section. The 
evaluation shall include the following:

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-114]]

        of nongovernment civilians at the school has resulted in a 
        discernible benefit for the Government.
            (B) Determination of whether the receipt and disposition of 
        funds received by the school as tuition for instruction of such 
        civilians at the school have been properly identified in records 
        of the school.
            (C) A summary of the disposition and uses made of those 
        funds.

SEC. 545. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE COURT-MARTIAL CONVICTION OF CAPTAIN 
            CHARLES BUTLER McVAY, COMMANDER OF THE U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS, 
            AND ON THE COURAGEOUS SERVICE OF THE CREW OF THAT VESSEL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Shortly after midnight on the morning of July 30, 1945, 
        during the closing days of World War II, the United States Navy 
        heavy cruiser U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) was torpedoed and sunk 
        by the Japanese submarine I-58 in what became the worst sea 
        disaster in the history of the United States Navy.
            (2) Although approximately 900 of the ship's crew of 1,196 
        survived the actual sinking, only 316 of those courageous 
        sailors survived when rescued after four and a half days adrift 
        in

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-117]]

        the open sea, the remainder having perishing from battle wounds, 
        drowning, predatory shark attacks, exposure to the elements, and 
        lack of food and potable water.
            (3) Rescue for the remaining 316 sailors came only when they 
        were spotted by chance by Navy Lieutenant Wilbur C. Gwinn while 
        flying a routine naval air patrol mission.
            (4) After the end of World War II, the commanding officer of 
        the U.S.S. Indianapolis, Captain Charles Butler McVay, III, who 
        was rescued with the other survivors, was court-martialed for 
        ``suffering a vessel to be hazarded through negligence'' by 
        failing to zigzag (a naval tactic employed to help evade 
        submarine attacks) and was convicted even though--
                    (A) the choice to zigzag was left to Captain McVay's 
                discretion in his orders; and
                    (B) Motchisura Hashimoto, the commander of the 
                Japanese submarine that sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis, 
                and Glynn R. Donaho, a United States Navy submarine 
                commander highly decorated for his service during World 
                War II, both testified at Captain McVay's court-martial 
                trial that the Japanese submarine could have sunk the 
                U.S.S. Indianapolis whether or not it had been 
                zigzagging, an assertion that has since been reaffirmed 
                in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Armed 
                Services of the Senate dated November 24, 1999.
            (5) Although not argued by Captain McVay's defense counsel 
        in the court-martial trial, poor visibility on the night of the 
        sinking (as attested in surviving crew members' handwritten 
        accounts recently discovered at the National Archives) justified 
        Captain McVay's choice not to zigzag as that choice was 
        consistent with the applicable Navy directives in force in 1945, 
        which stated that, ``During thick weather and at night, except 
        on very clear nights or during bright moonlight, vessels 
        normally cease zig-zagging.''.
            (6) Before the U.S.S. Indianapolis sailed from Guam on what 
        became her final voyage, Naval officials failed to provide 
        Captain McVay with available support that was critical to the 
        safety of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and her crew by--
                    (A) disapproving a request made by Captain McVay for 
                a destroyer escort for the U.S.S. Indianapolis across 
                the Philippine Sea as being ``not necessary'';
                    (B) not informing Captain McVay that naval 
                intelligence sources, through signal intelligence (the 
                Japanese code having been broken earlier in World War 
                II), had become aware that the Japanese submarine I-58 
                was operating in the area of the U.S.S. Indianapolis' 
                course (as disclosed in evidence presented in a hearing 
                of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate 
                conducted September 14, 1999); and
                    (C) not informing Captain McVay of the sinking of 
                the destroyer escort U.S.S. Underhill by a Japanese 
                submarine within range of the course of the U.S.S. 
                Indianapolis four days before the U.S.S. Indianapolis 
                departed Guam for the Philippine Islands.
            (7) Captain McVay's court-martial initially was opposed by 
        his immediate command superiors, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz 
        (CINCPAC) and Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance of the 5th fleet, 
        for whom the U.S.S. Indianapolis had served

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-118]]

        as flagship, but, despite their recommendations, Secretary of 
        the Navy James Forrestal ordered the court-martial, largely on 
        the basis of the recommendation of Fleet Admiral Ernest King, 
        Chief of Naval Operations.
            (8) There is no explanation on the public record for the 
        overruling by Secretary Forrestal of the recommendations made by 
        Admirals Nimitz and Spruance.
            (9) Captain McVay was the only commander of a United States 
        Navy vessel lost in combat to enemy action during World War II 
        who was subjected to a court-martial trial for such a loss, even 
        though several hundred United States Navy ships were lost in 
        combat to enemy action during World War II.
            (10) The survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis overwhelmingly 
        conclude that Captain McVay was not at fault in the loss of the 
        U.S.S. Indianapolis and have dedicated their lives to 
        vindicating their Captain McVay.
            (11) Although promoted to the grade of rear admiral in 
        accordance with then-applicable law upon retirement from the 
        Navy in 1949, Captain McVay never recovered from the stigma of 
        his post-war court-martial and in 1968, tragically, took his own 
        life.
            (12) Charles Butler McVay, III--
                    (A) was a graduate of the United States Naval 
                Academy;
                    (B) was an exemplary career naval officer with an 
                outstanding record (including participation in the 
                amphibious invasions of North Africa, the assault on Iwo 
                Jima, and the assault on Okinawa where the U.S.S. 
                Indianapolis under his command survived a fierce 
                kamikaze attack);
                    (C) was a recipient of the Silver Star earned for 
                courage under fire during the Solomon Islands campaign; 
                and
                    (D) with the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, had so 
                thoroughly demonstrated proficiency in naval warfare 
                that the Navy entrusted him and the crew of the U.S.S. 
                Indianapolis with transporting to the Pacific theater 
                components necessary for assembling the atomic bombs 
                that were exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end 
                the war with Japan (delivery of such components to the 
                island of Tinian having been accomplished on July 25, 
                1945).

    (b) Sense of Congress Concerning Charles Butler McVay, III.--With 
respect to the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) on July 30, 
1945, and the subsequent court-martial conviction of the ship's 
commanding officer, Captain Charles Butler McVay, III, arising from that 
sinking, it is the sense of Congress, based on the review of evidence by 
the Senate and the House of Representatives--
            (1) that, in light of the remission by the Secretary of the 
        Navy of the sentence of the court-martial and the restoration of 
        Captain McVay to active duty by the Chief of Naval Operations, 
        Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, the American people should now 
        recognize Captain McVay's lack of culpability for the tragic 
        loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and the lives of the men who 
        died as a result of the sinking of that vessel; and
            (2) that, in light of the fact that certain exculpatory 
        information was not available to the court-martial board and 
        that Captain McVay's conviction resulted therefrom, Captain

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-119]]

        McVay's military record should now reflect that he is exonerated 
        for the loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis and so many of her crew.

    (c) Unit Citation for Final Crew of U.S.S. Indianapolis.--The 
Secretary of the Navy should award a Navy Unit Commendation to the 
U.S.S. Indianapolis (CA-35) and her final crew.

SEC. 546. POSTHUMOUS ADVANCEMENT ON RETIRED LIST OF REAR ADMIRAL HUSBAND 
            E. KIMMEL AND MAJOR GENERAL WALTER C. SHORT, SENIOR OFFICERS 
            IN COMMAND IN HAWAII ON DECEMBER 7, 1941.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, while serving 
        in the temporary grade of admiral, was the Commander in Chief of 
        the United States Fleet and the Commander in Chief, United 
        States Pacific Fleet, at the time of the Japanese attack on 
        Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, with an excellent and 
        unassailable record throughout his career in the United States 
        Navy before that date.
            (2) The late Major General Walter C. Short, while serving in 
        the temporary grade of lieutenant general, was the Commander of 
        the United States Army Hawaiian Department, at the time of the 
        Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, 
        with an excellent and unassailable record throughout his career 
        in the United States Army before that date.
            (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl 
        Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant 
        General Short were not provided necessary and critical 
        intelligence that was available, that foretold of war with 
        Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that would have 
        alerted them to prepare for the attack, including such essential 
        communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb Plot message of 
        September 24, 1941, and the message sent from the Imperial 
        Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese Ambassador in the 
        United States from December 6 to 7, 1941, known as the Fourteen-
        Part Message.
            (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant 
        General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to 
        their permanent grades of rear admiral and major general, 
        respectively.
            (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a 
        member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts 
        Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General 
        Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the attack 
        on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report, maintaining that 
        ``these two officers were martyred'' and ``if they had been 
        brought to trial, both would have been cleared of the charge''.
            (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry--
                    (A) exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that 
                his military decisions and the disposition of his forces 
                at the time of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl 
                Harbor were proper ``by virtue of the information that 
                Admiral Kimmel had at hand which indicated neither the 
                probability nor the imminence of an air attack on Pearl 
                Harbor'';

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-120]]

                    (B) criticized the higher command for not sharing 
                with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very critical period of 
                November 26 to December 7, 1941, important information . 
                . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and
                    (C) concluded that the Japanese attack and its 
                outcome was attributable to no serious fault on the part 
                of anyone in the naval service.
            (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral 
        T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy 
        produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential 
        intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was 
        available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral Kimmel.
            (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of 
        Investigation determined that--
                    (A) Lieutenant General Short had not been kept 
                ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the Japanese 
                situation which indicated an increasing necessity for 
                better preparation for war'';
                    (B) detailed information and intelligence about 
                Japanese intentions and war plans were available in 
                ``abundance'' but were not shared with the Lieutenant 
                General Short's Hawaii command; and
                    (C) Lieutenant General Short was not provided ``on 
                the evening of December 6th and the early morning of 
                December 7th, the critical information indicating an 
                almost immediate break with Japan, though there was 
                ample time to have accomplished this''.
            (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the 
        Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, and 
        Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were denied their 
        requests to defend themselves through trial by court-martial.
            (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established to 
        investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General 
        Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report which 
        included the conclusions of the committee that the two officers 
        had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.
            (11) On April 27, 1954, the Chief of Naval Personnel, 
        Admiral J. L. Holloway, Jr., recommended that Rear Admiral 
        Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions of 
        the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.
            (12) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the 
        Board for the Correction of Military Records of the Department 
        of the Army found that Major General Short ``was unjustly held 
        responsible for the Pearl Harbor disaster'' and that ``it would 
        be equitable and just'' to advance him to the rank of lieutenant 
        general on the retired list.
            (13) In October 1994, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral 
        Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation against the 
        advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and recommended that his case 
        be reopened.
            (14) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a 
        Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, 
        1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear Admiral 
        Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set forth as a 
        conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for the

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-121]]

        Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of 
        Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it should be 
        broadly shared''.
            (15) The Dorn Report found--
                    (A) that ``Army and Navy officials in Washington 
                were privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic 
                communications . . . which provided crucial confirmation 
                of the imminence of war'';
                    (B) that ``the evidence of the handling of these 
                messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some 
                unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, limited 
                coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of 
                clarification and followup at higher levels''; and
                    (C) that ``together, these characteristics resulted 
                in failure . . . to appreciate fully and to convey to 
                the commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus and urgency 
                that these intercepts should have engendered''.
            (16) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson 
        (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report with 
        his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval Court of 
        Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation and 
        established, among other facts, that the war effort in 1941 was 
        undermined by a restrictive intelligence distribution policy, 
        and the degree to which the commanders of the United States 
        forces in Hawaii were not alerted about the impending attack on 
        Hawaii was directly attributable to the withholding of 
        intelligence from Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.
            (17) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a 
        promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal 
        basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed Forces 
        of the United States who served his country as a senior 
        commander during World War II with a placement of that officer, 
        with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the retired list 
        with the highest grade held while on the active duty list.
            (18) Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the 
        only two officers eligible for advancement under the Officer 
        Personnel Act of 1947 as senior World War II commanders who were 
        excluded from the list of retired officers presented for 
        advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime grades 
        under that Act.
            (19) This singular exclusion of those two officers from 
        advancement on the retired list serves only to perpetuate the 
        myth that the senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their 
        duty and responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl 
        Harbor, a distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor 
        toward two of the finest officers who have served in the Armed 
        Forces of the United States.
            (20) Major General Walter Short died on September 23, 1949, 
        and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, without 
        the honor of having been returned to their wartime grades as 
        were their fellow commanders of World War II.
            (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor 
        Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the Naval 
        Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers Association,

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-122]]

        and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, and other 
        associations and numerous retired military officers have called 
        for the rehabilitation of the reputations and honor of Admiral 
        Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through their posthumous 
        advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime 
        grades.

    (b) Advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short on 
Retired Lists.--(1) The President is requested--
            (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, 
        United States Navy (retired), to the grade of admiral on the 
        retired list of the Navy; and
            (B) to advance the late Major General Walter C. Short, 
        United States Army (retired), to the grade of lieutenant general 
        on the retired list of the Army.

    (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested under 
paragraph (1) shall not increase or change the compensation or benefits 
from the United States to which any person is now or may in the future 
be entitled based upon the military service of the officer advanced.
    (c) Sense of Congress Regarding the Professional Performance of 
Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.--It is the sense of 
Congress--
            (1) that the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel performed 
        his duties as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, 
        competently and professionally and, therefore, that the losses 
        incurred by the United States in the attacks on the naval base 
        at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other targets on the island of 
        Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a result of 
        dereliction in the performance of those duties by then Admiral 
        Kimmel; and
            (2) that the late Major General Walter C. Short performed 
        his duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, 
        competently and professionally and, therefore, that the losses 
        incurred by the United States in the attacks on Hickam Army Air 
        Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and other targets on the 
        island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a result 
        of dereliction in the performance of those duties by then 
        Lieutenant General Short.

SEC. 547. COMMENDATION OF CITIZENS OF REMY, FRANCE, FOR WORLD WAR II 
            ACTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) On August 2, 1944, a squadron of P-51s from the United 
        States 364th Fighter Group strafed a German munitions train in 
        Remy, France.
            (2) The resulting explosion killed Lieutenant Houston Braly, 
        one of the attacking pilots, and destroyed much of the village 
        of Remy, including seven stained glass windows in the 13th 
        century church.
            (3) Despite threats of reprisals from the occupying German 
        authorities, the citizens of Remy recovered Lieutenant Braly's 
        body from the wreckage, buried his body with dignity and honor 
        in the church's cemetery, and decorated the grave site daily 
        with fresh flowers.
            (4) On Armistice Day, 1995, the village of Remy renamed the 
        crossroads near the site of Lieutenant Braly's death in his 
        honor.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-123]]

            (5) The surviving members of the 364th Fighter Group desire 
        to express their gratitude to the brave citizens of Remy.
            (6) To express their gratitude, the surviving members of the 
        364th Fighter Group have organized a nonprofit corporation to 
        raise funds, through its project ``Windows for Remy'', to 
        restore the church's stained glass windows.

    (b) Commendation and Recognition.--The Congress commends the bravery 
and honor of the citizens of Remy, France, for their actions with 
respect to the American fighter pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly during 
and after August 1944, and recognizes the efforts of the surviving 
members of the United States 364th Fighter Group to raise funds to 
restore the stained glass windows of Remy's 13th century church.

SEC. 548. AUTHORITY FOR AWARD OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR TO WILLIAM H. 
            PITSENBARGER FOR VALOR DURING THE VIETNAM WAR.

    (a) Waiver of Time Limitations.--Notwithstanding the period of 
limitations specified in section 8744 of title 10, United States Code, 
or any other time limitation with respect to the awarding of certain 
medals to persons who served in the Air Force, the President may award 
the Medal of Honor under section 8741 of that title, posthumously, to 
William H. Pitsenbarger of Piqua, Ohio, for the acts of valor referred 
to in subsection (b).
    (b) Action Defined.--The acts of valor referred to in subsection (a) 
are the actions of William H. Pitsenbarger on April 11, 1966, as an Air 
Force pararescue crew member, serving in the grade of Airman First Class 
at Cam My, Republic of Vietnam, with Detachment 6, 38th Aerospace Rescue 
and Recovery Helicopter Squadron, in support of the combat mission known 
as ``Operations Abilene''.

        Subtitle E--Military Justice and Legal Assistance Matters

SEC. 551. RECOGNITION BY STATES OF MILITARY TESTAMENTARY INSTRUMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 53 of title 10, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 1044c the following new section:

``Sec. 1044d. Military testamentary instruments: requirement for 
                        recognition by States

    ``(a) Testamentary Instruments To Be Given Legal Effect.--A military 
testamentary instrument--
            ``(1) is exempt from any requirement of form, formality, or 
        recording before probate that is provided for testamentary 
        instruments under the laws of a State; and
            ``(2) has the same legal effect as a testamentary instrument 
        prepared and executed in accordance with the laws of the State 
        in which it is presented for probate.

    ``(b) Military Testamentary Instruments.--For purposes of this 
section, a military testamentary instrument is an instrument that is 
prepared with testamentary intent in accordance with regulations 
prescribed under this section and that--

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-124]]

            ``(1) is executed in accordance with subsection (c) by (or 
        on behalf of ) a person, as a testator, who is eligible for 
        military legal assistance;
            ``(2) makes a disposition of property of the testator; and
            ``(3) takes effect upon the death of the testator.

    ``(c) Requirements for Execution of Military Testamentary 
Instruments.--An instrument is valid as a military testamentary

SEC. 556. COMMEMORATION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIFORM CODE OF 
            MILITARY JUSTICE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-128]]

            (1) The American military justice system predates the United 
        States itself, having had a continuous existence since the 
        enactment of the first American Articles of War by the 
        Continental Congress in 1775.
            (2) Pursuant to article I of the Constitution, which 
        explicitly empowers Congress ``To make Rules for the Government 
        and Regulation of the land and naval Forces'', Congress enacted 
        the Articles of War and an Act to Govern the Navy, which were 
        revised on several occasions between the ratification of the 
        Constitution and the end of World War II.
            (3) Dissatisfaction with the administration of military 
        justice during World War I and World War II (including 
        dissatisfaction arising from separate systems of justice for the 
        Army and for the Navy and Marine Corps) led both to significant 
        statutory reforms in the Articles of War and to the convening of 
        a committee, under Department of Defense auspices, to draft a 
        single code of military justice applicable uniformly to all of 
        the Armed Forces.
            (4) The committee, chaired by Professor Edmund M. Morgan of 
        Harvard Law School, made recommendations that formed the basis 
        of bills introduced in Congress to establish such a uniform code 
        of military justice.
            (5) After lengthy hearings and debate on the congressional 
        proposals, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted into 
        law on May 5, 1950, when President Harry S Truman signed the 
        legislation.
            (6) President Truman then issued a revised Manual for 
        Courts-Martial implementing the new code, and the code became 
        effective on May 31, 1951.
            (7) One of the greatest innovations of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice (now codified as chapter 47 of title 10, United 
        States Code) was the establishment of a civilian court of 
        appeals within the military justice system. That court, the 
        United States Court of Military Appeals (now the United States 
        Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), held its first session 
        on July 25, 1951.
            (8) Congress enacted major revisions of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice in 1968 and 1983 and, in addition, has amended 
        the code from time to time over the years as practice under the 
        code indicated a need for updating the substance or procedure of 
        the law of military justice.
            (9) The evolution of the system of military justice under 
        the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be traced in the 
        decisions of the Courts of Criminal Appeals of each of the Armed 
        Forces and the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals 
        for the Armed Forces. These courts have produced a unique body 
        of jurisprudence upon which commanders and judge advocates rely 
        in the performance of their duties.
            (10) It is altogether fitting that the 50th anniversary of 
        the Uniform Code of Military Justice be duly commemorated.

    (b) Commemoration.--The Congress--
            (1) requests the President to issue a proclamation 
        commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uniform Code of 
        Military Justice; and
            (2) calls upon the Department of Defense, the Armed Forces, 
        and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and 
        interested organizations and members of the bar

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-129]]

        and the public to commemorate the occasion of that anniversary 
        with ceremonies and activities befitting its importance.

surviving spouses who are under age 62 and those who are 62 years of age 
and older.

amended by inserting after section 2306b the following:

``Sec. 2306c. Multiyear contracts: acquisition of services

    ``(a) Authority.--Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the head of an 
agency may enter into contracts for periods of not more than five years 
for services described in subsection (b), and for items of supply 
related to such services, for which funds would otherwise be available 
for obligation only within the fiscal year for which appropriated 
whenever the head of the agency finds that--
            ``(1) there will be a continuing requirement for the 
        services consonant with current plans for the proposed contract 
        period;
            ``(2) the furnishing of such services will require a 
        substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or the 
        incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the 
        assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work 
        force; and

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-204]]

            ``(3) the use of such a contract will promote the best 
        interests of the United States by encouraging effective 
        competition and promoting economies in operation.

    ``(b) Covered Services.--The authority under subsection (a) applies 
to the following types of services:
            ``(1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and 
        installations.
            ``(2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, 
        vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment.
            ``(3) Specialized training necessitating high quality 
        instructor skills (for example, pilot and air crew members; 
        foreign language training).
            ``(4) Base services (for example, ground maintenance; in-
        plane refueling; bus transportation; refuse collection and 
        disposal).

    ``(c) Applicable Principles.--In entering into multiyear contracts 
for services under the authority of this section, the head of the agency 
shall be guided by the following principles:
            ``(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment 
        amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed 
        the ratio between the period of contract performance and the 
        anticipated useful commercial life of such plant or equipment. 
        Useful commercial life, for this purpose, means the commercial 
        utility of the facilities rather than the physical life thereof, 
        with due consideration given to such factors as location of 
        facilities, specialized nature thereof, and obsolescence.
            ``(2) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of 
        obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable 
        period not to exceed three years, at prices not to include 
        charges for plant, equipment and other nonrecurring costs, 
        already amortized.
            ``(3) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of 
        reserving in the agency the right, upon payment of the 
        unamortized portion of the cost of the plant or equipment, to 
        take title thereto under appropriate circumstances.

    ``(d) Restrictions Applicable Generally.--(1) The head of an agency 
may not initiate under this section a contract for services that 
includes an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20,000,000 
unless the committees of Congress named in paragraph (5) are notified of 
the proposed contract at least 30 days in advance of the award of the 
proposed contract.
    ``(2) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract 
for services under this section if the value of the multiyear contract 
would exceed $500,000,000 unless authority for the contract is 
specifically provided by law.
    ``(3) The head of an agency may not terminate a multiyear 
procurement contract for services until 10 days after the date on which 
notice of the proposed termination is provided to the committees of 
Congress named in paragraph (5).
    ``(4) Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains 
a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 
may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written 
notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation 
ceiling for that contract to the committees of Congress named in 
paragraph (5), and such contract may not then be awarded until the end 
of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.

        Appropriations of the Senate.
            ``(B) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives.

    ``(e) Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding After 
First Year.--In the event that funds are not made available for the 
continuation of a multiyear contract for services into a subsequent 
fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated, and the costs 
of cancellation or termination may be paid from--
            ``(1) appropriations originally available for the 
        performance of the contract concerned;
            ``(2) appropriations currently available for procurement of 
        the type of services concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or
            ``(3) funds appropriated for those payments.

    ``(f ) Multiyear Contract Defined.--For the purposes of this 
section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of services 
for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a 
contract may provide that performance under the contract during the 
second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the 
appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a 
cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations 
are not made.''.

            (1) Over the last three decades Congress has authorized and 
        appropriated funds for a total of 10 Nimitz class aircraft 
        carriers.
            (2) The last vessel in the Nimitz class of aircraft 
        carriers, CVN-77, is currently under construction and will be 
        delivered in 2008.
            (3) The first nine vessels in this class bear the following 
        proud names:
                    (A) U.S.S. Nimitz (CVN-68).
                    (B) U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69).
                    (C) U.S.S. Carl Vinson (CVN-70).
                    (D) U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71).

                    (F) U.S.S. George Washington (CVN-73).
                    (G) U.S.S. John C. Stennis (CVN-74).
                    (H) U.S.S. Harry S. Truman (CVN-75).
                    (I) U.S.S. Ronald Reagan (CVN-76).
            (4) It is appropriate for Congress to recommend to the 
        President, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, an 
        appropriate name for the final vessel in the Nimitz class of 
        aircraft carriers.
            (5) Over the last 25 years the vessels in the Nimitz class 
        of aircraft carriers have served as one of the principal means 
        of United States diplomacy and as one of the principal means for 
        the defense of the United States and its allies around the 
        world.
            (6) The name bestowed upon the aircraft carrier CVN-77 
        should embody the American spirit and provide a lasting symbol 
        of the American commitment to freedom.
            (7) The name ``Lexington'' has been a symbol of freedom from 
        the first battle of the American Revolution.
            (8) The two aircraft carriers previously named U.S.S. 
        Lexington (the CV-2 and the CV-16) served the Nation for 64 
        years, served in World War II, and earned a total of 13 battle 
        stars.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-253]]

            (9) One of those honored vessels, the CV-2, was lost at the 
        Battle of the Coral Sea on May 8, 1942.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the CVN-77 
aircraft carrier should be named the ``U.S.S. Lexington''--
            (1) in order to honor the men and women who served in the 
        Armed Forces of the United States during World War II and the 
        incalculable number of United States citizens on the home front 
        during that war who mobilized in the name of freedom; and
            (2) as a special tribute to the 16,000,000 veterans of the 
        Armed Forces who served on land, sea, and air during World War 
        II (of whom fewer than 6,000,000 remain alive today) and a 
        lasting symbol of their commitment to freedom as they pass on 
        having proudly taken their place in history.

``carryover''). On the basis of the review, the Comptroller General 
shall determine the following:
            (1) The extent to which the working-capital fund activities 
        of the Department of Defense have complied with the 90-day 
        carryover policy.

        to apply to as much as a 90-day quantity of work.
            (3) Whether applying the carryover authority to not more 
        than a 30-day quantity of work would be sufficient to ensure 
        uninterrupted operations at the working-capital fund activities 
        early in a fiscal year.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-265]]

            (4) What, if any, savings could be achieved by restricting 
        the carryover authority so as to apply to a 30-day quantity of 
        work.

SEC. 1236. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE USE OF CHILDREN AS SOLDIERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the year 2000, approximately 300,000 individuals 
        under the age of 18 are participating in armed conflict in more 
        than 30 countries worldwide.
            (2) Many children participating in armed conflict in various 
        countries around the world are forcibly conscripted through 
        kidnapping or coercion, while others join military units due to 
        economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, or 
        for their own personal safety.
            (3) Many military commanders frequently force child soldiers 
        to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or torture against 
        their enemies, including against other children.
            (4) Many military commanders separate children from their 
        families in order to foster dependence on military units and 
        leaders, leaving children vulnerable to manipulation, deep 
        traumatization, and in need of psychological counseling and 
        rehabilitation.
            (5) Child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and 
        risk physical injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, 
        malnutrition, deformed backs and shoulders from carrying 
        overweight loads, and respiratory and skin infections.
            (6) Many young female soldiers face the additional 
        psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, 
        being enslaved for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and 
        forced to endure severe social stigma should they return home.
            (7) Children in northern Uganda continue to be kidnapped by 
        the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which is supported and funded 
        by the Government of Sudan and which has committed and continues 
        to commit gross human rights violations in Uganda.
            (8) Children in Sri Lanka have been forcibly recruited by 
        the opposition Tamil Tigers movement and forced to kill or be 
        killed in the armed conflict in that country.
            (9) An estimated 7,000 child soldiers have been involved in 
        the conflict in Sierra Leone, some as young as age 10, with many 
        being forced to commit extrajudicial executions, torture, rape, 
        and amputations for the rebel Revolutionary United Front.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-332]]

            (10) On January 21, 2000, in Geneva, a United Nations 
        Working Group, including representatives from more than 80 
        governments including the United States, reached consensus on an 
        international agreement, referred to in this case as an 
        ``optional protocol'', on the use of child soldiers.
            (11) This optional protocol, upon entry into force, will--
                    (A) raise the international minimum age for 
                conscription and will require governments to take all 
                feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed 
                forces under age 18 do not participate directly in 
                combat;
                    (B) prohibit the recruitment and use in armed 
                conflict of persons under the age of 18 by 
                nongovernmental armed forces;
                    (C) encourage governments to raise the minimum legal 
                age for voluntary recruits above the current standard of 
                15; and
                    (D) commit governments to support the demobilization 
                and rehabilitation of child soldiers and, when possible, 
                to allocate resources to this purpose.
            (12) On October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary General 
        Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United Nations 
        peacekeeping personnel that are made available by member nations 
        of the United Nations.
            (13) The United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace-
        keeping, Bernard Miyet, announced in the Fourth Committee of the 
        General Assembly that contributing governments of member nations 
        were asked not to send civilian police and military observers 
        under the age of 25 and that troops in national contingents 
        should preferably be at least 21 years of age but in no case 
        should they be younger than 18 years of age.
            (14) On August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security Council 
        unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning the use of 
        children in armed conflicts.
            (15) In addressing the Security Council on August 26, 1999, 
        the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children 
        and Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global 
        three-pronged approach to combatting the use of children in 
        armed conflict that would--
                    (A) first, raise the age limit for recruitment and 
                participation in armed conflict from the present age of 
                15 to the age of 18;
                    (B) second, increase international pressure on armed 
                groups which currently abuse children; and
                    (C) third, address the political, social, and 
                economic factors that create an environment in which 
                children are induced by appeal of ideology or by socio-
                economic collapse to become child soldiers.
            (16) The United States delegation to the United Nations 
        working group relating to child soldiers, which included 
        representatives from the Department of Defense, supported the 
        Geneva agreement on the optional protocol.
            (17) On May 25, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly 
        unanimously adopted the optional protocol on the use of child 
        soldiers.
            (18) The optional protocol was opened for signature on June 
        5, 2000.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-333]]

            (19) The President signed the optional protocol on behalf of 
        the United States on July 5, 2000.

    (b) Congressional Statements on Child Soldiers.--Congress joins the 
international community in--
            (1) condemning the use of children as soldiers by 
        governmental and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and
            (2) welcoming the optional protocol on the use of child 
        soldiers adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on May 
        25, 2000, as a critical first step in ending the use of children 
        as soldiers.

    (c) Sense of Congress on Further Actions.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) it is essential that the President consult closely with 
        the Senate with the objective of building support for 
        ratification by the United States of the optional protocol and 
        that the Senate move forward as expeditiously as possible;
            (2) the United States should provide assistance, through a 
        new fund to be established by law, for the rehabilitation and 
        reintegration into their respective civilian societies of child 
        soldiers of other nations; and
            (3) the President, acting through the Secretaries of State 
        and Defense and other appropriate officials, should undertake 
        all possible efforts to persuade and encourage other governments 
        to ratify and endorse the optional protocol on the use of child 
        soldiers.

SEC. 1237. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNDERSEA RESCUE AND RECOVERY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The tragic loss in August 2000 of the Russian submarine 
        Kursk resulted in the death of all 118 members of the 
        submarine's crew.
            (2) The Kursk is the third vessel of the submarine fleet of 
        the Russian Federation and its predecessor, the Union of Soviet 
        Socialist Republics, to be lost in an accident at sea with 
        considerable loss of life of the officers and crews of those 
        submarines.
            (3) The United States submarines USS Thresher and USS 
        Scorpion, with their officers and crews, were also lost at sea 
        in tragic accidents, in 1963 and 1968, respectively.
            (4) The United States, the Russian Federation, and other 
        maritime nations possess extensive capabilities consisting of 
        naval and research vessels and other assets that could be used 
        to respond to accidents or incidents involving submarines or 
        other undersea vessels.
            (5) The United States Navy has rescue agreements with the 
        navies of 14 countries from Europe, the Western Pacific, and the 
        Americas, but not including the Russian Federation, and 
        exercises regularly to train crews and practice submarine rescue 
        procedures with the navies of participating nations.

    (b) Expression of Sympathy.--Congress expresses its sympathy and the 
sympathy of the American people to the people of the Russian Federation 
and joins the Russian people in mourning the death of the crewmen of the 
submarine Kursk.
    (c) Sense of Congress Concerning International Cooperation.--It is 
the sense of Congress that when undersea accidents or incidents 
involving submarines or other undersea vessels occur,

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-334]]

it is in the best interests of all nations to work together to respond 
promptly to the accident or incident, rescue and recover the crew of the 
vessel, minimize the loss of life, and prevent damage to the oceans.
    (d) Establishment of Plan for Responding to Undersea Accidents or 
Incidents.--Congress urges the President of the United States and the 
President of the Russian Federation, in coordination with the leaders of 
other maritime nations that possess undersea naval and research vessels 
and undersea rescue capabilities, to cooperate in establishing a plan 
for--
            (1) responding to accidents or incidents involving 
        submarines or other undersea vessels; and
            (2) rescue and recovery of the crew of the vessels involved 
        in such accidents or incidents.

            (3) The transfers provide the Department of the Air Force 
        and the Department of the Army with complete land management 
        control of these public domain lands to allow for effective land 
        management, minimize safety concerns, and ensure meaningful

                the Government, except in any case in which obtaining 
                the best value would require towing a vessel and such 
                towing poses a serious threat to the environment; and''.

    (b) Selection of Scrapping Facilities.--The Secretary of 
Transportation may scrap obsolete vessels pursuant to section 6(c)(1) of

domestic facilities taking into consideration, among other things, the 
ability of facilities to scrap vessels--
            (1) at least cost to the Government;
            (2) in a timely manner;
            (3) giving consideration to worker safety and the 
        environment; and
            (4) in a manner that minimizes the geographic distance that 
        a vessel must be towed when towing a vessel poses a serious 
        threat to the environment.

SEC. 3602. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since World War II, Federal nuclear activities have been 
        explicitly recognized under Federal law as activities that are 
        ultra-hazardous. Nuclear weapons production and testing have 
        involved unique dangers, including potential catastrophic 
        nuclear accidents that private insurance carriers have not 
        covered and recurring exposures to radioactive substances and 
        beryllium that, even in small amounts, can cause medical harm.
            (2) Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and 
        for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear 
        weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at 
        sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at 
        risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, 
        documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, 
        liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.
            (3) Many previously secret records have documented 
        unmonitored exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing 
        problems at these sites across the Nation, at which the 
        Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, 
        since World War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear 
        safety and occupational safety and health. No other hazardous 
        Federal activity has been permitted to be carried out under such 
        sweeping powers of self-regulation.
            (4) The policy of the Department of Energy has been to 
        litigate occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-496]]

        from filing workers' compensation claims and has imposed major 
        financial burdens for such employees who have sought 
        compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held 
        harmless and the employees have been denied workers' 
        compensation coverage for occupational disease.
            (5) Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific 
        findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such 
        employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer 
        and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies have also 
        established a correlation between excess diseases and exposure 
        to radiation and beryllium.
            (6) While linking exposure to occupational hazards with the 
        development of occupational disease is sometimes difficult, 
        scientific evidence supports the conclusion that occupational 
        exposure to dust particles or vapor of beryllium can cause 
        beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease. 
        Furthermore, studies indicate than 98 percent of radiation-
        induced cancers within the nuclear weapons complex have occurred 
        at dose levels below existing maximum safe thresholds.
            (7) Existing information indicates that State workers' 
        compensation programs do not provide a uniform means of ensuring 
        adequate compensation for the types of occupational illnesses 
        and diseases that relate to the employees at those sites.
            (8) To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and 
        women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties 
        uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing 
        programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor 
        agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate 
        compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and 
        radiation-related health conditions.
            (9) On April 12, 2000, the Secretary of Energy announced 
        that the Administration intended to seek compensation for 
        individuals with a broad range of work-related illnesses 
        throughout the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex.
            (10) However, as of October 2, 2000, the Administration has 
        failed to provide Congress with the necessary legislative and 
        budget proposals to enact the promised compensation program.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a program should be established to provide compensation 
        to covered employees;
            (2) a fund for payment of such compensation should be 
        established on the books of the Treasury;
            (3) payments from that fund should be made only after--
                    (A) the identification of employees of the 
                Department of Energy (including its predecessor 
                agencies), and of contractors of the Department, who may 
                be members of the group of covered employees;
                    (B) the establishment of a process to receive and 
                administer claims for compensation for disability or 
                death of covered employees;
                    (C) the submittal by the President of a legislative 
                proposal for compensation of such employees that 
                includes the estimated annual budget resources for that 
                compensation; and

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-497]]

                    (D) consideration by the Congress of the legislative 
                proposal submitted by the President; and
            (4) payments from that fund should commence not later than 
        fiscal year 2002.

    (3) Such guidelines shall--
            (A) be based on the radiation dose received by the employee 
        (or a group of employees performing similar work) at such 
        facility and the upper 99 percent confidence interval of the 
        probability of causation in the radioepidemiological tables 
        published under section 7(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (42 U.S.C. 
        241 note), as such tables may be updated under section 7(b)(3) 
        of such Act from time to time;
            (B) incorporate the methods established under subsection 
        (d); and

SEC. 3626. DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF SPECIAL EXPOSURE COHORT.

    (a) Advice on Additional Members.--(1) The Advisory Board on 
Radiation and Worker Health under section 3624 shall advise the 
President whether there is a class of employees at any Department of 
Energy facility who likely were exposed to radiation at that facility 
but for whom it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the 
radiation dose they received.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1654A-505]]

    (2) The advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health 
under paragraph (1) shall be based on exposure assessments by radiation 
health professionals, information provided by the Department of Energy, 
and such other information as the Advisory Board considers appropriate.
    (3) The President shall request advice under paragraph (1) after 
consideration of petitions by classes of employees described in that 
paragraph for such advice. The President shall consider such petitions 
pursuant to procedures established by the President.
    (b) Designation of Additional Members.--Subject to the provisions of 
section 3621(14)(C), the members of a class of employees at a Department 
of Energy facility may be treated as members of the Special Exposure 
Cohort for purposes of the compensation program if the President, upon 
recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, 
determines that--
            (1) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy 
        the radiation dose that the class received; and
            (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation 
        dose may have endangered the health of members of the class.

    (c) Access to Information.--The Secretary of Energy shall provide, 
in accordance with law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
the members and staff of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker 
Health access to relevant information on worker exposures, including 
access to Restricted Data (as defined in section 11 y. of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2014(y)).

SEC. 3627. SEPARATE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC SILICOSIS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress finds that employees who worked in 
Department of Energy test sites and later contracted chronic silicosis 
should also be considered for inclusion in the compensation program. 
Recognizing that chronic silicosis resulting from exposure to silica is 
not a condition unique to the nuclear weapons industry, it is not the 
intent of Congress with this title to establish a precedent on the 
question of chronic silicosis as a compensable occupational disease. 
Consequently, it is the sense of Congress that a further determination 
by the President is appropriate before these workers are included in the 
compensation program.
    (b) Certification by President.--A covered employee with chronic 
silicosis shall be treated as a covered employee (as defined in section 
3621(1)) for the purposes of the compensation program required by 
section 3611 unless the President submits to Congress not later than 180 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act the certification of 
the President that there is insufficient basis to include such 
employees. The President shall submit with the certification any 
recommendations about the compensation program with respect to covered 
employees with chronic silicosis as the President considers appropriate.
    (c) Exposure to Silica in the Performance of Duty.--A covered 
employee shall, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, 
be determined to have been exposed to silica in the performance of duty 
for the purposes of the compensation program if, and only if, the 
employee was present for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 
work days during the mining of tunnels at a Department of Energy 
facility located in Nevada or Alaska for tests or experiments related to 
an atomic weapon.
