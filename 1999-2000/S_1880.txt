SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 287c-31 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:

[[Page 114 STAT. 2496]]

            (1) Despite notable progress in the overall health of the 
        Nation, there are continuing disparities in the burden of 
        illness and death experienced by African Americans, Hispanics, 
        Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Asian Pacific Islanders, 
        compared to the United States population as a whole.
            (2) The largest numbers of the medically underserved are 
        white individuals, and many of them have the same health care 
        access problems as do members of minority groups. Nearly 
        20,000,000 white individuals live below the poverty line with 
        many living in nonmetropolitan, rural areas such as Appalachia, 
        where the high percentage of counties designated as health 
        professional shortage areas (47 percent) and the high rate of 
        poverty contribute to disparity outcomes. However, there is a 
        higher proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the United 
        States represented among the medically underserved.
            (3) There is a national need for minority scientists in the 
        fields of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health services 
        research. Ninety percent of minority physicians educated at 
        Historically Black Medical Colleges live and serve in minority 
        communities.
            (4) Demographic trends inspire concern about the Nation's 
        ability to meet its future scientific, technological, and 
        engineering workforce needs. Historically, non-Hispanic white 
        males have made up the majority of the United States scientific, 
        technological, and engineering workers.
            (5) The Hispanic and Black population will increase 
        significantly in the next 50 years. The scientific, 
        technological, and engineering workforce may decrease if 
        participation by underrepresented minorities remains the same.
            (6) Increasing rates of Black and Hispanic workers can help 
        ensure a strong scientific, technological, and engineering 
        workforce.
            (7) Individuals such as underrepresented minorities and 
        women in the scientific, technological, and engineering 
        workforce enable society to address its diverse needs.
            (8) If there had not been a substantial increase in the 
        number of science and engineering degrees awarded to women and 
        underrepresented minorities over the past few decades, the 
        United States would be facing even greater shortages in 
        scientific, technological, and engineering workers.
            (9) In order to effectively promote a diverse and strong 
        21st century scientific, technological, and engineering 
        workforce, Federal agencies should expand or add programs that 
        effectively overcome barriers such as educational transition 
        from one level to the next and student requirements for 
        financial resources.
            (10) Federal agencies should work in concert with the 
        private nonprofit sector to emphasize the recruitment and 
        retention of qualified individuals from ethnic and gender groups 
        that are currently underrepresented in the scientific, 
        technological, and engineering workforce.
            (11) Behavioral and social sciences research has increased 
        awareness and understanding of factors associated with health 
        care utilization and access, patient attitudes toward health 
        services, and risk and protective behaviors that affect health 
        and illness. These factors have the potential to then be 
        modified

[[Page 114 STAT. 2497]]

        to help close the health disparities gap among ethnic minority 
        populations. In addition, there is a shortage of minority 
        behavioral science researchers and behavioral health care 
        professionals. According to the National Science Foundation, 
        only 15.5 percent of behavioral research-oriented psychology 
        doctorate degrees were awarded to minority students in 1997. In 
        addition, only 17.9 percent of practice-oriented psychology 
        doctorate degrees were awarded to ethnic minorities.
