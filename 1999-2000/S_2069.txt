Public Law 106-495
106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
          To permit the conveyance of certain land in Powell, 
              Wyoming. <<NOTE: Nov. 9, 2000 -  [S. 2069]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ELIMINATION OF PUBLIC PURPOSE CONDITION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the parcel of land described in subsection (c) was 
        patented to the town (now City) of Powell, Wyoming, by the 
        United States General Land Office on October 17, 1934, to help 
        establish a town near the Shoshone Irrigation Project;
            (2) the land was patented with the condition that it be used 
        forever for a public purpose, as required by section 3 of the 
        Act of April 16, 1906 (43 U.S.C. 566);
            (3) the land has been used to house the Powell Volunteer 
        Fire Department, which serves the firefighting and rescue needs 
        of a 577 square mile area in northwestern Wyoming;
            (4) the land is located at the corner of U.S. Highway 14 and 
        the main street of the business district of the City;
            (5) because of the high traffic flow in the area, the 
        location is no longer safe for the public or for the fire 
        department;
            (6) in response to population growth in the area and to 
        National Fire Protection Association regulations, the fire 
        department has purchased new firefighting equipment that is much 
        larger than the existing fire hall can accommodate;
            (7) accordingly, the fire department must construct a new 
        fire department facility at a new and safe location;
            (8) in order to relocate and construct a new facility, the 
        City must sell the land to assist in financing the new fire 
        department facility; and
            (9) the Secretary of the Interior concurs that it is in the 
        public interest to eliminate the public purpose condition to 
        enable the land to be sold for that purpose.

    (b) Elimination of Condition.--
            (1) Waiver.--The condition stated in section 3 of the Act of 
        April 16, 1906 (43 U.S.C. 566), that land conveyed under that 
        Act be used forever for a public purpose is waived insofar as 
        the condition applies to the land described in subsection (c).
            (2) Instruments.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
        execute and cause to be recorded in the appropriate land records 
        any instruments necessary to evidence the waiver made by 
        paragraph (1).
