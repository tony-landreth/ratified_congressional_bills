        under paragraph (2).

amounts accepted as contributions under subsection (a). The Secretary of 
the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on, and the proceeds 
from sale or redemption of, obligations held in the fund.
    ``(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest any portion of the 
fund that, as determined by the Chairman, is not required to meet 
current expenses. Each investment shall be made in an interest-bearing 
obligation of the United States or an obligation guaranteed as to 
principal and interest by the United States that,

[[Page 113 STAT. 1577]]

as determined by the Chairman, has a maturity suitable for the fund.
    ``(c) Use of Fund.--The fund shall be available to the Commission--
            ``(1) for the expenses of establishing the World War II 
        memorial, including the maintenance and preservation amount

        assigned to, or licensed to the Commission under section 2114 of 
        this title to aid or facilitate the construction of the World 
        War II memorial.

    ``(d) Special Borrowing Authority.--(1) To assure that 
groundbreaking, construction, and dedication of the World War II 
memorial are carried out on a timely basis, the Commission may borrow 
money from the Treasury of the United States in such amounts as the 
Commission considers necessary, but not to exceed a total of 
$65,000,000. Borrowed amounts shall bear interest at a rate determined 
by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average 
market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States 
of comparable maturities during the month preceding the month in which 
the obligations of the Commission are issued. The interest payments on 
such obligations may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary, but 
any interest payment so deferred shall also bear interest.
    ``(2) The borrowing of money by the Commission under paragraph (1) 
shall be subject to such maturities, terms, and conditions as may be 
agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary, except that the 
maturities may not exceed 20 years and such borrowings may be redeemable 
at the option of the Commission before maturity.
    ``(3) The obligations of the Commission shall be issued in amounts 
and at prices approved by the Secretary. The authority of the Commission 
to issue obligations under this subsection shall remain available 
without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
purchase any obligations of the Commission to be issued under this 
subsection, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury may use 
as a public debt transaction of the United States the proceeds from the 
sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes 
for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to 
include any purchase of the Commission's obligations under this 
subsection.
    ``(4) Repayment of the interest and principal on any funds borrowed 
by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be made from amounts in the 
fund. The Commission may not use for such purpose any funds appropriated 
for any other activities of the Commission.
    ``(e) Treatment of Borrowing Authority.--In determining whether the 
Commission has sufficient funds to complete construction of the World 
War II memorial, as required by section 8 of the Commemorative Works Act 
(40 U.S.C. 1008), the Secretary of the Interior shall consider the funds 
that the Commission may borrow from the Treasury under subsection (d) as 
funds available

[[Page 113 STAT. 1578]]

to complete construction of the memorial, whether or not the Commission 
has actually exercised the authority to borrow such funds.
    ``(f ) Voluntary Services.--(1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of 
title 31, the Commission may accept from any person voluntary services 
to be provided in furtherance of the fund-raising activities of the 
Commission relating to the World War II memorial.

shall be considered to be a Federal employee for purposes of chapter 81 
of title 5, relating to compensation for work-related injuries, and 
chapter 171 of title 28, relating to tort claims. A volunteer who is not 
otherwise employed by the United States shall not be considered to be a 
Federal employee for any other purpose by reason of the provision of 
such voluntary service, except that any volunteer given responsibility 
for the handling of funds or the carrying out of a Federal function is 
subject to the conflict of interest laws contained in chapter 11 of 
title 18 and the administrative standards of conduct contained in part 
2635 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    ``(3) The Commission may provide for reimbursement of incidental 
expenses that are incurred by a person providing voluntary services 
under this subsection. The Commission shall determine those expenses 
that are eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.
    ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any 
Federal employee to work without compensation or to allow the use of 
volunteer services to displace or replace any Federal employee.
    ``(g) Treatment of Certain Contracts.--A contract entered into by 
the Commission for the design or construction of the World War II 
memorial is not a funding agreement as that term is defined in section 
201 of title 35.
    ``(h) <<NOTE: Expiration date.>>  Extension of Authority To 
Establish Memorial.--Notwithstanding section 10 of the Commemorative 
Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1010), the authority for the construction of the 
World War II memorial provided by Public Law 103-32 (40 U.S.C. 1003

    ``(2) <<NOTE: Guidelines.>>  The Commission shall establish written 
guidelines setting forth the criteria to be used in determining whether 
the acceptance of funds and in-kind donations and gifts under paragraph 
(1) would--
            ``(A) reflect unfavorably on the ability of the Commission, 
        or any member or employee of the Commission, to carry out the 
        responsibilities or official duties of the Commission in a fair
