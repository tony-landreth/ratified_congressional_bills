    ``(a) In General.--In the case of States whose laws or regulations 
are in accordance with subsection (b), the Secretary, subject to 
subsection (c)(2), may make grants to the States for carrying out 
programs to provide partner counseling and referral services.
    ``(b) Description of Compliant State Programs.--For purposes of 
subsection (a), the laws or regulations of a State are in accordance 
with this subsection if under such laws or regulations (including 
programs carried out pursuant to the discretion of State officials) the 
following policies are in effect:
            ``(1) The State requires that the public health officer of 
        the State carry out a program of partner notification to inform 
        partners of individuals with HIV disease that the partners may 
        have been exposed to the disease.
            ``(2)(A) In the case of a health entity that provides for 
        the performance on an individual of a test for HIV disease, or 
        that treats the individual for the disease, the State requires, 
        subject to subparagraph (B), that the entity confidentially 
        report the positive test results to the State public health 
        officer in a manner recommended and approved by the Director of 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with 
        such additional information as may be necessary for carrying out 
        such program.
            ``(B) The State may provide that the requirement of 
        subparagraph (A) does not apply to the testing of an individual 
        for HIV disease if the individual underwent the testing through 
        a program designed to perform the test and provide the results 
        to the individual without the individual disclosing his or her 
        identity to the program. This subparagraph may not be construed 
        as affecting the requirement of subparagraph (A) with respect to 
        a health entity that treats an individual for HIV disease.

[[Page 114 STAT. 1344]]

            ``(3) The program under paragraph (1) is carried out in 
        accordance with the following:
                    ``(A) Partners are provided with an appropriate 
                opportunity to learn that the partners have been exposed 
                to HIV disease, subject to subparagraph (B).
                    ``(B) The State does not inform partners of the 
                identity of the infected individuals involved.
                    ``(C) Counseling and testing for HIV disease are 
                made available to the partners and to infected 
                individuals, and such counseling includes information on 
                modes of transmission for the disease, including 
                information on prenatal and perinatal transmission and 
                preventing transmission.
                    ``(D) Counseling of infected individuals and their 
                partners includes the provision of information regarding 
                therapeutic measures for preventing and treating the 
                deterioration of the immune system and conditions 
                arising from the disease, and the provision of other 
                prevention-related information.
                    ``(E) Referrals for appropriate services are 
                provided to partners and infected individuals, including 
                referrals for support services and legal aid.
                    ``(F) Notifications under subparagraph (A) are 
                provided in person, unless doing so is an unreasonable 
                burden on the State.
                    ``(G) There is no criminal or civil penalty on, or 
                civil liability for, an infected individual if the 
                individual chooses not to identify the partners of the 
                individual, or the individual does not otherwise 
                cooperate with such program.
                    ``(H) The failure of the State to notify partners is 
                not a basis for the civil liability of any health entity 
                who under the program reported to the State the identity 
                of the infected individual involved.
                    ``(I) The State provides that the provisions of the 
                program may not be construed as prohibiting the State 
                from providing a notification under subparagraph (A) 
                without the consent of the infected individual involved.
            ``(4) The State annually reports to the Director of the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number of 
        individuals from whom the names of partners have been sought 
        under the program under paragraph (1), the number of such 
        individuals who provided the names of partners, and the number 
        of partners so named who were notified under the program.
            ``(5) The State cooperates with such Director in carrying 
        out a national program of partner notification, including the 
        sharing of information between the public health officers of the 
        States.

    ``(c) Reporting System for Cases of HIV Disease; Preference in 
Making Grants.--In making grants under subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall give preference to States whose reporting systems for cases of HIV 
disease produce data on such cases that is sufficiently accurate and 
reliable for use for purposes of section 2618(a)(2)(D)(i).
    ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying 
out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 
for fiscal year 2001, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 
fiscal years 2002 through 2005.''.

``Secretary'') shall request the Institute of Medicine to enter into an 
agreement with the Secretary under which such Institute conducts a study 
to provide the following:
            (1) A determination of whether the surveillance system of 
        each of the States regarding the human immunodeficiency virus 
        provides for the reporting of cases of infection with the virus 
        in a manner that is sufficient to provide adequate and reliable 
        information on the number of such cases and the demographic 
        characteristics of such cases, both for the State in general and 
        for specific geographic areas in the State.

        for low-income, uninsured, and under-insured individuals with 
        HIV disease.
            (2) Issues to be considered.--The Secretary shall ensure 
        that the study under paragraph (1) considers the following:
                    (A) The availability and utility of health outcomes 
                measures and data for HIV primary care and support 
                services and the extent to which those measures and data 
                could be used to measure the quality of such funded 
                services.
                    (B) The effectiveness and efficiency of service 
                delivery (including the quality of services, health 
                outcomes, and resource use) within the context of a

                title on the basis of infection with the human 
                immunodeficiency virus rather than providing such 
                assistance only if the infection has progressed to 
                acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
                    (C) Existing and needed epidemiological data and 
                other analytic tools for resource planning and 
                allocation decisions, specifically for estimating 
                severity of need of a community and the relationship to 
                the allocations process.

                availability of multiple rapid HIV tests;
                    (B) make recommendations regarding the need for the 
                expedited review of rapid HIV test applications 
                submitted to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
                Research and, if such recommendations are favorable, 
                specify criteria and procedures for such expedited 
                review; and
                    (C) specify whether the barriers to the premarket 
                review of rapid HIV tests include the unnecessary 
                application of requirements--
                          (i) necessary to ensure the efficacy of 
                      devices for donor screening to rapid HIV tests 
                      intended for use in other screening situations; or
                          (ii) for identifying antibodies to HIV 
                      subtypes of rare incidence in the United States to 
                      rapid HIV tests intended for use in screening 
                      situations other than donor screening.

    (c) Guidelines of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.--
Promptly after commercial distribution of a rapid HIV test begins, the 
Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, shall establish or update guidelines that 
include recommendations for States, hospitals, and other appropriate 
entities regarding the ready availability of such tests for 
administration to pregnant women who are in labor or in the late stage 
of pregnancy and whose HIV status is not known to the attending 
obstetrician.
