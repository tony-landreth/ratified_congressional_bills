Public Law 106-154
106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To improve protection and management of the Chattahoochee River National 
 Recreation Area in the State of Georgia. <<NOTE: Dec. 9, 1999 -  [H.R. 
                                2140]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 16 USC 460ii note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in the 
        State of Georgia is a nationally significant resource;
            (2) the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area has 
        been adversely affected by land use changes occurring inside and 
        outside the recreation area;
            (3) the population of the metropolitan Atlanta area 
        continues to expand northward, leaving dwindling opportunities 
        to protect the scenic, recreational, natural, and historical 
        values of the 2,000-foot-wide corridor adjacent to each bank of 
        the Chattahoochee River and its impoundments in the 48-mile 
        segment known as the ``area of national concern'';
            (4) the State of Georgia has enacted the Metropolitan River 
        Protection Act to ensure protection of the corridor located 
        within 2,000 feet of each bank of the Chattahoochee River, or 
        the corridor located within the 100-year floodplain, whichever 
        is larger;
            (5) the corridor located within the 100-year floodplain 
        includes the area of national concern;
            (6) since establishment of the Chattahoochee River National 
        Recreation Area, visitor use of the recreation area has shifted 
        dramatically from waterborne to water-related and land-based 
        activities;
            (7) the State of Georgia and political subdivisions of the 
        State along the Chattahoochee River have indicated willingness 
        to join in a cooperative effort with the United States to link 
        existing units of the recreation area through a series of linear 
        corridors to be established within the area of national concern 
        and elsewhere on the river; and
            (8) if Congress appropriates funds in support of the 
        cooperative effort described in paragraph (7), funding from the 
        State, political subdivisions of the State, private foundations, 
        corporate entities, private individuals, and other sources will 
        be available to fund more than half the estimated cost of the 
        cooperative effort.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to increase the level of protection of the open spaces 
        within the area of national concern along the Chattahoochee 
        River and to enhance visitor enjoyment of the open spaces by 
        adding land-based linear corridors to link existing units of the 
        recreation area;
            (2) to ensure that the Chattahoochee River National 
        Recreation Area is managed to standardize acquisition, planning, 
        design, construction, and operation of the linear corridors; and
            (3) to authorize the appropriation of Federal funds to cover 
        a portion of the costs of the Federal, State, local, and private 
        cooperative effort to add additional areas to the recreation 
        area so as to establish a series of linear corridors linking 
        existing units of the recreation area and to protect other open 
        spaces of the Chattahoochee River corridor.
