SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 3503 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) during the past 2 decades, Senator John H. Chafee was a 
        leading voice for the protection of the environment and the 
        conservation of the natural resources of the United States;
            (2) Senator Chafee served on the Environment and Public 
        Works Committee of the Senate for 22 years, influencing every 
        major piece of environmental legislation enacted during that 
        time;
            (3) Senator Chafee led the fight for clean air, clean water, 
        safe drinking water, and cleanup of toxic wastes, and for 
        strengthening of the National Wildlife Refuge System and 
        protections for endangered species and their habitats;
            (4) millions of people of the United States breathe cleaner 
        air, drink cleaner water, and enjoy more plentiful outdoor 
        recreation opportunities because of the work of Senator Chafee;
            (5) in 1982, Senator Chafee authored and succeeded in 
        enacting into law the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 
        3501 et seq.) to minimize loss of human life, wasteful 
        expenditure of Federal revenues, and damage to fish, wildlife, 
        and other natural resources associated with the coastal barriers 
        along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts; and
            (6) to reflect the invaluable national contributions made by 
        Senator Chafee during his service in the Senate, the Coastal 
        Barrier Resources System should be named in his honor.
