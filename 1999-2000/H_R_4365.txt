                             LOSS IN INFANTS

SEC. 701. <<NOTE: 42 USC 280g-1 note.>> PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are to clarify the authority within the 
Public Health Service Act to authorize statewide newborn and infant 
hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems, 
technical assistance, a national applied research program, and 
interagency and private sector collaboration for policy development, in 
order to assist the States in making progress toward the following 
goals:
            (1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and 
        its territories should have a hearing screening before leaving 
        the birthing facility. Babies born in other countries and 
        residing in the United States via immigration or adoption should 
        have a hearing screening as early as possible.
            (2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the United 
        States and its territories should have a hearing screening 
        within the first 3 months of life.
            (3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations should be 
        conducted by 3 months for all newborns and infants suspected of 
        having hearing loss to allow appropriate referral and provisions 
        for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention 
        before the age of 6 months.
            (4) All newborn and infant hearing screening programs and 
        systems should include a component for audiologic 
        rehabilitation, medical and early intervention options that 
        ensures linkage to any new and existing state-wide systems of 
        intervention and rehabilitative services for newborns and 
        infants with hearing loss.
            (5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant hearing 
        screening and intervention should be based on applied research 
        and the recognition that newborns, infants, toddlers, and 
        children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have unique language, 
        learning, and communication needs, and should be the result of 
        consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.

    ``(a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--

        organizations and certain individuals on the basis of religion 
        in the distribution of government funds to provide substance 
        abuse services under this title and title V, and the receipt of 
        services under such titles; and
            ``(2) to allow the organizations to accept the funds to 
        provide the services to the individuals without impairing the 
        religious character of the organizations or the religious 
        freedom of the individuals.

    ``(b) Religious Organizations Included as Nongovernmental 
Providers.--
            ``(1) In general.--A State may administer and provide 
        substance abuse services under any program under this title or

        nongovernmental organizations.
            ``(2) Requirement.--A State that elects to utilize 
        nongovernmental organizations as provided for under paragraph 
        (1) shall consider, on the same basis as other nongovernmental 
        organizations, religious organizations to provide services under 
        substance abuse programs under this title or title V, so long as 
        the programs under such titles are implemented in a manner 
        consistent with the Establishment Clause of the first amendment 
        to the Constitution. Neither the Federal Government nor a State 
        or local government receiving funds under such programs shall 
        discriminate against an organization that provides services 
        under, or applies to provide services under, such programs, on 
        the basis that the organization has a religious character.

    ``(c) Religious Character and Independence.--
            ``(1) In general.--A religious organization that provides 
        services under any substance abuse program under this title or 
        title V shall retain its independence from Federal, State, and

        the definition, development, practice, and expression of its 
        religious beliefs.
            ``(2) Additional safeguards.--Neither the Federal Government 
        nor a State or local government shall require a religious 
        organization--
                    ``(A) to alter its form of internal governance; or

                other symbols,
        in order to be eligible to provide services under any substance 
        abuse program under this title or title V.

    ``(d) Employment Practices.--
            ``(1) Substance abuse.--A religious organization that 
        provides services under any substance abuse program under this 
        title or title V may require that its employees providing 
        services under such program adhere to rules forbidding the use 
        of drugs or alcohol.
            ``(2) Title vii exemption.--The exemption of a religious 
        organization provided under section 702 or 703(e)(2) of the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1, 2000e-2(e)(2))

        of funds from, any substance abuse program under this title or 
        title V.

    ``(e) Rights of Beneficiaries of Assistance.--
            ``(1) In general.--If an individual described in paragraph 
        (3) has an objection to the religious character of the 
        organization from which the individual receives, or would 
        receive, services funded under any substance abuse program under 
        this title or title V, the appropriate Federal, State, or local 
        governmental entity shall provide to such individual (if 
        otherwise eligible for such services) within a reasonable period 
        of time after the date of such objection, services that--
                    ``(A) are from an alternative provider that is 
                accessible to the individual; and

                of the services that the individual would have received 
                from such organization.

cooperative agreement under any substance abuse program under this title 
or title V shall not discriminate, in carrying out such program, against 
an individual described in subsection (e)(3) on the basis of religion, a 
religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to 
actively participate in a religious practice.
    ``(g) Fiscal Accountability.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), any 
        religious organization providing services under any substance 
        abuse program under this title or title V shall be subject to 
        the same regulations as other nongovernmental organizations to 
        account in accord with generally accepted accounting principles 
        for the use of such funds provided under such program.
            ``(2) Limited audit.--Such organization shall segregate 
        government funds provided under such substance abuse program 
        into a separate account. Only the government funds shall be 
        subject to audit by the government.

    ``(h) Compliance.--Any party that seeks to enforce such party's 
rights under this section may assert a civil action for injunctive 
relief exclusively in an appropriate Federal or State court against the 
entity, agency or official that allegedly commits such violation.
    ``(i) Limitations on Use of Funds for Certain Purposes.--No funds 
provided through a grant or contract to a religious organization to 
provide services under any substance abuse program under this title or 
title V shall be expended for sectarian worship, instruction, or 
proselytization.
    ``( j) Effect on State and Local Funds.--If a State or local 
government contributes State or local funds to carry out any substance 
abuse program under this title or title V, the State or local government 
may segregate the State or local funds from the

[[Page 114 STAT. 1215]]

Federal funds provided to carry out the program or may commingle the 
State or local funds with the Federal funds. If the State or local 
government commingles the State or local funds, the provisions of this 
section shall apply to the commingled funds in the same manner, and to 
the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds.
    ``(k) Treatment of Intermediate Contractors.--If a nongovernmental 
organization (referred to in this subsection as an `intermediate 
organization'), acting under a contract or other agreement with the 
Federal Government or a State or local government, is given the 
authority under the contract or agreement to select nongovernmental 
organizations to provide services under any substance abuse program 
under this title or title V, the intermediate organization shall have 
the same duties under this section as the government but shall retain 
all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under this 
section.''.

        and the Secretary for such purposes may by regulation establish 
        different categories on the basis of the number of practitioners 
        in a group practice and establish for the various categories 
        different numerical limitations on the number of such patients

this subparagraph with respect to narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or 
V or combinations of such drugs are as follows:

[[Page 114 STAT. 1224]]

        consultation with the Attorney General, that the use of the 
        drugs or combinations of drugs for maintenance or detoxification 
        treatment requires additional standards respecting the 
        qualifications of practitioners to provide such treatment, or 
        requires standards respecting the quantities of the drugs that 
        may be provided for unsupervised use.

    ``(D)(i) A waiver under subparagraph (A) with respect to a 
practitioner is not in effect unless (in addition to conditions under 
subparagraphs (B) and (C)) the following conditions are met:

        and states the name of the practitioner.

        the practice and identifies the registrations issued for the 
        other practitioners pursuant to subsection (f ).

    ``(ii) Upon receiving a notification under subparagraph (B), the 
Attorney General shall assign the practitioner involved an 
identification number under this paragraph for inclusion with the 
registration issued for the practitioner pursuant to subsection (f ).

the confidentiality of patients for whom the practitioner has dispensed 
narcotic drugs under a waiver under subparagraph (A).

which the Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), the 
Secretary shall make a determination of whether the practitioner 
involved meets all requirements for a waiver under subparagraph (B). If

45-day period, the Attorney General shall assign the physician an 
identification number described in clause (ii) at the end of such 
period.

and, in violation of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (B) 
through (D), dispenses narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or 
combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification 
treatment, the Attorney General may, for purposes of section 304(a)(4), 
consider the practitioner to have committed an act that renders the 
registration of the practitioner pursuant to subsection (f ) to be 
inconsistent with the public interest.
    ``(ii)(I) <<NOTE: Expiration date.>> Upon the expiration of 45 days 
from the date on which the Secretary receives a notification under 
subparagraph (B), a practitioner who in good faith submits a 
notification under subparagraph (B) and reasonably believes that the 
conditions specified in subparagraphs (B) through (D) have been met 
shall, in dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or 
combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification 
treatment, be considered to have a waiver under subparagraph (A) until 
notified otherwise by the Secretary, except that such a practitioner may 
commence to prescribe or dispense such narcotic drugs for such purposes 
prior to the expiration of such 45-day period if it facilitates the 
treatment of an individual patient and both the Secretary and the 
Attorney General are notified by the practitioner of the intent to 
commence prescribing or dispensing such narcotic drugs.

subclause (I), the publication in the Federal Register of an adverse 
determination by the Secretary pursuant

Secretary to practitioners, effective upon the expiration of the 30-day 
period beginning on the date on which the adverse determination is so 
published.

                production of illicit drugs; and
                    (B) the best practical method of preventing such use 
                is the establishment of single-transaction limits for

 Subtitle <<NOTE: Ecstasy Anti- Proliferation Act of 2000.>> C--Ecstasy 
AntiProliferationAct of 2000

SEC. 3661. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act 
of 2000''.

 SEC. 3662. <<NOTE: 42 USC 290aa-5b note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The illegal importation of 3,4-methylenedioxy 
        methamphetamine, commonly referred to as ``MDMA'' or ``Ecstasy'' 
        (referred to in this subtitle as ``Ecstasy''), has increased in 
        recent years, as evidenced by the fact that Ecstasy seizures by 
        the United States Customs Service have increased from less than 
        500,000 tablets during fiscal year 1997 to more than 9,000,000 
        tablets during the first 9 months of fiscal year 2000.
            (2) Use of Ecstasy can cause long-lasting, and perhaps 
        permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which is 
        fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, and 
        this damage can cause long-term problems with learning and 
        memory.
            (3) Due to the popularity and marketability of Ecstasy, 
        there are numerous Internet websites with information on the 
        effects of Ecstasy, the production of Ecstasy, and the locations 
        of Ecstasy use (often referred to as ``raves''). The 
        availability

[[Page 114 STAT. 1242]]

        of this information targets the primary users of Ecstasy, who 
        are most often college students, young professionals, and other 
        young people from middle- to high-income families.
            (4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on--
                    (A) penalties associated with the manufacture, 
                distribution, and use of Ecstasy;
                    (B) the education of young people on the negative 
                health effects of Ecstasy, since the reputation of 
                Ecstasy as a ``safe'' drug is the most dangerous 
                component of Ecstasy;
                    (C) the education of State and local law enforcement 
                agencies regarding the growing problem of Ecstasy 
                trafficking across the United States;
                    (D) reducing the number of deaths caused by Ecstasy 
                use and the combined use of Ecstasy with other ``club'' 
                drugs and alcohol; and
                    (E) adequate funding for research by the National 
                Institute on Drug Abuse to--
                          (i) identify those most vulnerable to using 
                      Ecstasy and develop science-based prevention 
                      approaches tailored to the specific needs of 
                      individuals at high risk;
                          (ii) understand how Ecstasy produces its toxic 
                      effects and how to reverse neurotoxic damage;
                          (iii) develop treatments, including new 
                      medications and behavioral treatment approaches;
                          (iv) better understand the effects that 
                      Ecstasy has on the developing children and 
                      adolescents; and
                          (v) translate research findings into useful 
                      tools and ensure their effective dissemination.

SEC. 3663. <<NOTE: 28 USC 994 note.>> ENHANCED PUNISHMENT OF ECSTASY 
            TRAFFICKERS.

    (a) Amendment to Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant to its 
authority under section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, the 
United States Sentencing Commission (referred to in this section as the 
``Commission'') shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines regarding 
any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, 
or trafficking in--
            (1) 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;
            (2) 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine;
            (3) 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine;
            (4) paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA); or
            (5) any other controlled substance, as determined by the 
        Commission in consultation with the Attorney General, that is 
        marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure 
        substantially similar to that of 3,4-methylenedioxy 
        methamphetamine or an effect on the central nervous system 
        substantially similar to or greater than that of 3,4-
        methylenedioxy methamphetamine,

including an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in 
paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) in violation of the Controlled 
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import 
and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law 
Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.).
    (b) General Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the 
Commission shall, with respect to each offense described in subsection 
(a)--

[[Page 114 STAT. 1243]]

            (1) review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to 
        provide for increased penalties such that those penalties 
        reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the need to deter 
        them; and
            (2) take any other action the Commission considers to be 
        necessary to carry out this section.

    (c) Additional Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the 
Commission shall ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines for 
offenders convicted of offenses described in subsection (a) reflect--
            (1) the need for aggressive law enforcement action with 
        respect to offenses involving the controlled substances 
        described in subsection (a); and
            (2) the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving 
        such substances, including--
                    (A) the rapidly growing incidence of abuse of the 
                controlled substances described in subsection (a) and 
                the threat to public safety that such abuse poses;
                    (B) the recent increase in the illegal importation 
                of the controlled substances described in subsection 
                (a);
                    (C) the young age at which children are beginning to 
                use the controlled substances described in subsection 
                (a);
                    (D) the fact that the controlled substances 
                described in subsection (a) are frequently marketed to 
                youth;
                    (E) the large number of doses per gram of the 
                controlled substances described in subsection (a); and
                    (F) any other factor that the Commission determines 
                to be appropriate.

    (d) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the base offense levels for Ecstasy are too low, 
        particularly for high-level traffickers, and should be 
        increased, such that they are comparable to penalties for other 
        drugs of abuse; and
            (2) based on the fact that importation of Ecstasy has surged 
        in the past few years, the traffickers are targeting the 
        Nation's youth, and the use of Ecstasy among youth in the United 
        States is increasing even as other drug use among this 
        population appears to be leveling off, the base offense levels 
        for importing and trafficking the controlled substances 
        described in subsection (a) should be increased.

    (e) Report.--Not <<NOTE: Deadline.>> later than 60 days after the 
amendments pursuant to this section have been promulgated, the 
Commission shall--
            (1) prepare a report describing the factors and information 
        considered by the Commission in promulgating amendments pursuant 
        to this section; and
            (2) submit the report to--
                    (A) the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on 
                Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the 
                Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on 
                Commerce, and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
                House of Representatives.
