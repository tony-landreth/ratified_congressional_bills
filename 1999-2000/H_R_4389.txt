        of the Interior.
            (4) Transferred water distribution facilities.--The term 
        ``transferred water distribution facilities'' means the North 
        Poudre Supply Canal and Diversion Works, also known as the 
        Munroe Gravity Canal, the Charles Hansen (Supply) Canal and 
        Windsor Extension, and the Dixon Feeder Canal, all of which are 
        facilities of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project located in 
        Larimer County, Colorado.

 SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF TRANSFERRED WATER DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable after 
the date of the enactment of this Act and in accordance with all 
applicable law, convey to the District all right, title, and interest in 
and to the transferred water distribution facilities.
    (b) Sale Price.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall accept $150,315 as 
        payment from the District and $1,798,200 as payment from the 
        power customers under the terms specified in this section, as 
        consideration for the conveyance under subsection (a). Out of 
        the receipts from the sale of power from the Loveland Area 
        Projects collected by the Western Area Power Administration and 
        deposited into the Reclamation fund of the Treasury in fiscal 
        year 2001, $1,798,200 shall be treated as full and complete 
        payment by the power customers of such consideration and 
        repayment by the power customers of all aid to irrigation 
        associated with the facilities conveyed under subsection (a).
            (2) No effect on obligations and rights.--Except as 
        expressly provided in this Act, nothing in this Act affects or 
        modifies the obligations and rights of the District under the 
        contract.
            (3) Payments.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the 
        District shall continue to make such payments as are required 
        under the contract.

    (c) Credit Toward Project Repayment.--Upon payment by the District 
of the amount authorized to be accepted from the District under 
subsection (b)(1), the amount paid shall be credited toward repayment of 
capital costs of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project in an amount equal to 
the associated undiscounted obligation for repayment of the capital 
costs.

 SEC. 3. LIABILITY.

    Except as otherwise provided by law, effective on the date of 
conveyance of the transferred water distribution facilities under this 
Act, the United States shall not be liable for damages of any kind 
arising out of any act, omission, or occurrence based on any prior 
ownership or operation by the United States of the conveyed property.
