        regarding Federal contracting involving women-owned small 
        businesses for the 3 preceding fiscal years;
            (2) solicit from Federal employees involved in the Federal 
        procurement system any suggestions regarding how to increase the 
        number of Federal contracts awarded to women-owned small 
        businesses; and
            (3) submit to Congress a report on the results of that 
        audit, which report shall include--
                    (A) an analysis of any identified trends in Federal 
                contracting with respect to women-owned small 
                businesses;
                    (B) any recommended means to increase the number of

                suggestions received pursuant to a solicitation 
                described in paragraph (2), including any such means 
                that incorporate the concepts of teaming or partnering;
