        responsible for the works of improvement. Such operation and 
        maintenance activities shall remain the responsibility of the 
        local organization, as provided in the project work plan.
            ``(2) Renegotiation.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), as part

        for the operation and maintenance of the project when the 
        rehabilitation is finished.

State agency having such responsibility, by the Governor of the State. 
The Secretary shall request the State dam safety officer (or equivalent 
State official) to be involved in the application process if State 
permits or approvals are required. The rehabilitation of structural 
measures shall meet standards established by the Secretary and address 
other dam safety issues. At the request of the local organization, 
personnel of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the 
Department of Agriculture may assist in preparing applications for 
assistance.

process shall be in writing, and made known to all local organizations 
and appropriate State agencies.
    ``(g) Prohibition on Certain Rehabilitation Assistance.--The 
Secretary may not approve a rehabilitation request if the need for 
rehabilitation of the structure is the result of a lack of adequate 
maintenance by the party responsible for the maintenance.

SEC. 314. RELEASE OF REVERSIONARY INTEREST AND CONVEYANCE OF MINERAL 
            RIGHTS IN FORMER FEDERAL LAND IN SUMTER COUNTY, SOUTH 
            CAROLINA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The hiking trail known as the Palmetto Trail traverses 
        the Manchester State Forest in Sumter County, South Carolina, 
        which is owned by the South Carolina State Commission of 
        Forestry on behalf of the State of South Carolina.
            (2) The Commission seeks to widen the Palmetto Trail by 
        acquiring a corridor of land along the northeastern border of 
        the trail from the Anne Marie Carton Boardman Trust in exchange 
        for a tract of former Federal land now owned by the Commission.
            (3) At the time of the conveyance of the former Federal land 
        to the Commission in 1955, the United States retained a 
        reversionary interest in the land, which now prevents the land 
        exchange from being completed.

    (b) Release of Reversionary Interest.--
            (1) Release required.--In the case of the tract of land 
        identified as Tract 3 on the map numbered 161-DI and further 
        described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall 
        release the reversionary interest of the United States in the 
        land that--
                    (A) requires that the land be used for public 
                purposes; and
                    (B) is contained in the deed conveying the land from 
                the United States to the South Carolina State Commission 
                of Forestry, dated June 28, 1955, and recorded in Deed 
                Drawer No. 6 of the Clerk of Court for Sumter County, 
                South Carolina.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2081]]

            (2) Map of tract 3.--Tract 3 is generally depicted on the 
        map numbered 161-DI, entitled ``Boundary Survey for South 
        Carolina Forestry Commission'', dated August 1998, and filed, 
        together with a legal description of the tract, with the South 
        Carolina State Commission of Forestry.
            (3) Consideration.--As consideration for the release of the 
        revisionary interest under paragraph (1), the State of South 
        Carolina shall transfer to the United States a vested future 
        interest, similar to the restriction described in paragraph 
        (1)(A), in the tract of land identified as Parcel G on the map 
        numbered 225-HI, entitled ``South Carolina Forestry Commission 
        Boardman Land Exchange'', dated June 9, 1999, and filed, 
        together with a legal description of the tract, with the South 
        Carolina State Commission of Forestry.

    (c) Exchange of Mineral Rights.--
            (1) Exchange required.--Subject to any valid existing rights 
        of third parties, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to 
        the South Carolina State Commission of Forestry on behalf of the 
        State of South Carolina all of the undivided mineral rights of 
        the United States in the Tract 3 identified in subsection (b)(1) 
        in exchange for mineral rights of equal value held by the State 
        of South Carolina in the Parcel G identified in subsection 
        (b)(3) as well as in Parcels E and F owned by the State and also 
        depicted on the map referred to in subsection (b)(3).
            (2) Determination of mineral character.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
        of the Interior shall determine--
                    (A) the mineral character of Tract 3 and Parcels E, 
                F, and G; and
                    (B) the fair market value of the mineral interests.
