        solicit the views of older individuals, providers, and other 
        stakeholders on implementation of cost-sharing in the service 
        area or the State.

        under subsection (a), each State and area agency on aging shall

        of low-income older individuals (with particular attention to 
        low-income minority individuals and older individuals residing 
        in rural areas) receiving services will not decrease with the 
        implementation of the cost sharing under such subsection.

the date of the enactment of the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000, 
and annually thereafter, the Assistant Secretary shall conduct a 
comprehensive evaluation of practices for cost sharing to determine its 
impact on participation rates with particular attention to low-income 
and minority older individuals and older individuals residing in rural 
areas. If the Assistant Secretary finds that there is a disparate impact 
upon low-income or minority older individuals or older individuals 
residing in rural areas in any State or region within the State

corrective action to assure that such services are provided to all older 
individuals without regard to the cost sharing criteria.
