Public Law 106-483
106th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
   Recognizing that the Birmingham <<NOTE: Nov. 9, 2000 -  [H.J. Res. 
 102]>> Pledge has made a significant contribution in fostering racial 
 harmony and reconciliation in the United States and around the world, 
                         and for other purposes.

Whereas <<NOTE: Alabama.>> Birmingham, Alabama, was the scene of racial 
    strife in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s;

Whereas since the 1960s, the people of Birmingham have made substantial 
    progress toward racial equality, which has improved the quality of 
    life for all its citizens and led to economic prosperity;

Whereas out of the crucible of Birmingham's role in the civil rights 
    movement of the 1950s and 1960s, a present-day grassroots movement 
    has arisen to continue the effort to eliminate racial and ethnic 
    divisions in the United States and around the world;

Whereas that grassroots movement has found expression in the Birmingham 
    Pledge, which was authored by Birmingham attorney James E. Rotch, is 
    sponsored by the Community Affairs Committee of Operation New 
    Birmingham, and is promoted by a broad cross section of the 
    community of Birmingham;

Whereas the Birmingham Pledge reads as follows:
        ``I believe that every person has worth as an individual.
        ``I believe that every person is entitled to dignity and 
    respect, regardless of race or color.
        ``I believe that every thought and every act of racial prejudice 
    is harmful; if it is in my thought or act, then it is harmful to me 
    as well as to others.
        ``Therefore, from this day forward I will strive daily to 
    eliminate racial prejudice from my thoughts and actions.
        ``I will discourage racial prejudice by others at every 
    opportunity.
        ``I will treat all people with dignity and respect; and I will 
    strive to honor this pledge, knowing that the world will be a better 
    place because of my effort.'';

Whereas commitment and adherence to the Birmingham Pledge increases 
    racial harmony by helping individuals communicate in a positive way 
    concerning the diversity of the people of the United States and by 
    encouraging people to make a commitment to racial harmony;

Whereas individuals who sign the Birmingham Pledge give evidence of 
    their commitment to its message;

Whereas more than 70,000 people have signed the Birmingham Pledge, 
    including the President, Members of Congress, Governors,


[[Page 114 STAT. 2194]]

  State legislators, mayors, county commissioners, city council members, 
    and other persons around the world;

Whereas the Birmingham Pledge has achieved national and international 
    recognition;

Whereas efforts to obtain signatories to the Birmingham Pledge are being 
    organized and conducted in communities around the world;

Whereas every Birmingham Pledge signed and returned to Birmingham is 
    recorded at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, 
    Alabama, as a permanent testament to racial reconciliation, peace, 
    and harmony; and

Whereas the Birmingham Pledge, the motto for which is ``Sign It, Live 
    It'', is a powerful tool for facilitating dialogue on the Nation's 
    diversity and the need for people to take personal steps to achieve 
    racial harmony and tolerance in communities: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That--
            (1) Congress recognizes that the Birmingham Pledge is a 
        significant contribution toward fostering racial harmony and 
        reconciliation in the United States and around the world;
            (2) Congress commends the creators, promoters, and 
        signatories of the Birmingham Pledge for the steps they are 
        taking to make the United States and the world a better place 
        for all people; and
            (3) it is the sense of the Congress that a particular week 
        should be designated as ``National Birmingham Pledge Week''.

    Approved November 9, 2000.
