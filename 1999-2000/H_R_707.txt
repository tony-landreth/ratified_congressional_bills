SEC. 101. <<NOTE: 42 USC 5133 note.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

[[Page 114 STAT. 1553]]

            (1) natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, 
        tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, pose great 
        danger to human life and to property throughout the United 
        States;
            (2) greater emphasis needs to be placed on--
                    (A) identifying and assessing the risks to States 
                and local governments (including Indian tribes) from 
                natural disasters;
                    (B) implementing adequate measures to reduce losses 
                from natural disasters; and
                    (C) ensuring that the critical services and 
                facilities of communities will continue to function 
                after a natural disaster;
            (3) expenditures for postdisaster assistance are increasing 
        without commensurate reductions in the likelihood of future 
        losses from natural disasters;
            (4) in the expenditure of Federal funds under the Robert T. 
        Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
        5121 et seq.), high priority should be given to mitigation of 
        hazards at the local level; and
            (5) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness 
        and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal 
        support, States and local governments (including Indian tribes) 
        will be able to--
                    (A) form effective community-based partnerships for 
                hazard mitigation purposes;
                    (B) implement effective hazard mitigation measures 
                that reduce the potential damage from natural disasters;
                    (C) ensure continued functionality of critical 
                services;
                    (D) leverage additional non-Federal resources in 
                meeting natural disaster resistance goals; and
                    (E) make commitments to long-term hazard mitigation 
                efforts to be applied to new and existing structures.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish a national 
disaster hazard mitigation program--
            (1) to reduce the loss of life and property, human 
        suffering, economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs 
        resulting from natural disasters; and
            (2) to provide a source of predisaster hazard mitigation 
        funding that will assist States and local governments (including 
        Indian tribes) in implementing effective hazard mitigation 
        measures that are designed to ensure the continued functionality 
        of critical services and facilities after a natural disaster.

    (a) In General.--Title II of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief

property, including damage to critical services and facilities under the 
jurisdiction of the States or local governments.
    ``(c) Approval by President.--If the President determines that a 
State or local government has identified natural disaster hazards in 
areas under its jurisdiction and has demonstrated the ability to form 
effective public-private natural disaster hazard mitigation 
partnerships, the President, using amounts in the National Predisaster 
Mitigation Fund established under subsection (i) (referred to in this 
section as the `Fund'), may provide technical and financial assistance 
to the State or local government to be used in accordance with

                the President determines that extraordinary 
                circumstances justify the selection and that making the 
                selection will further the purpose of this section.

        State fails to submit recommendations under this subsection in a 
        timely manner, the President may select, subject to the criteria
