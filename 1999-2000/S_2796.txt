[[Page 114 STAT. 2606]]

            (2) the burden of carrying out efforts to raise and stock 
        fish species in Fort Peck Lake has been disproportionately borne 
        by the State of Montana despite the existence of a Federal 
        project at Fort Peck Lake;
            (3)(A) as of the date of enactment of this Act, eastern 
        Montana has only 1 warm water fish hatchery, which is inadequate 
        to meet the demands of the region; and
            (B) a disease or infrastructure failure at that hatchery 
        could imperil fish populations throughout the region;
            (4) although the multipurpose project at Fort Peck, Montana, 
        authorized by the first section of the Act of August 30, 1935 
        (49 Stat. 1034, chapter 831), was intended to include irrigation 
        projects and other activities designed to promote economic 
        growth, many of those projects were never completed, to the 
        detriment of the local communities flooded by the Fort Peck Dam;
            (5) the process of developing an environmental impact 
        statement for the update of the Corps of Engineers Master Manual 
        for the operation of the Missouri River recognized the need for 
        greater support of recreation activities and other authorized 
        purposes of the Fort Peck project;
            (6)(A) although fish stocking is included among the 
        authorized purposes of the Fort Peck project, the State of 
        Montana has funded the stocking of Fort Peck Lake since 1947; 
        and
            (B) the obligation to fund the stocking constitutes an undue 
        burden on the State; and
            (7) a viable multispecies fishery would spur economic 
        development in the region.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to authorize and provide funding for the design and 
        construction of a multispecies fish hatchery at Fort Peck Lake,

SEC. 602. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING HOMESTEAD AIR FORCE BASE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Everglades is an American treasure and includes 
        uniquely-important and diverse wildlife resources and 
        recreational opportunities;
            (2) the preservation of the pristine and natural character 
        of the South Florida ecosystem is critical to the regional 
        economy;
            (3) as this legislation demonstrates, Congress believes it 
        to be a vital national mission to restore and preserve this 
        ecosystem and accordingly is authorizing a significant Federal 
        investment to do so;
            (4) Congress seeks to have the remaining property at the 
        former Homestead Air Base conveyed and reused as expeditiously 
        as possible, and several options for base reuse are being 
        considered, including as a commercial airport; and
            (5) Congress is aware that the Homestead site is located in 
        a sensitive environmental location, and that Biscayne National 
        Park is only approximately 1.5 miles to the east, Everglades 
        National Park approximately 8 miles to the west, and the Florida 
        Keys National Marine Sanctuary approximately 10 miles to the 
        south.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) development at the Homestead site could potentially 
        cause significant air, water, and noise pollution and result in 
        the degradation of adjacent national parks and other protected 
        Federal resources;
            (2) in their decisionmaking, the Federal agencies charged 
        with determining the reuse of the remaining property at the 
        Homestead base should carefully consider and weigh all available 
        information concerning potential environmental impacts of 
        various reuse options;
            (3) the redevelopment of the former base should be 
        consistent with restoration goals, provide desirable numbers of

[[Page 114 STAT. 2694]]

        jobs and economic redevelopment for the community, and be 
        consistent with other applicable laws;
            (4) consistent with applicable laws, the Secretary of the 
        Air Force should proceed as quickly as practicable to issue a 
        final SEIS and Record of Decision so that reuse of the former 
        air base can proceed expeditiously;
            (5) following conveyance of the remaining surplus property, 
        the Secretary, as part of his oversight for Everglades 
        restoration, should cooperate with the entities to which the 
        various parcels of surplus property were conveyed so that the 
        planned use of those properties is implemented in such a manner 
        as to remain consistent with the goals of the Everglades 
        restoration plan; and
            (6) <<NOTE: Deadline. Reports.>> not later than August 1, 
        2002, the Secretary should submit a report to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress on actions taken and make any 
        recommendations for consideration by Congress.

     TITLE <<NOTE: Missouri River Protection and Improvement Act of 
2000. Conservation.>> VII--MISSOURI RIVER RESTORATION, NORTH DAKOTA

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Missouri River Protection and 
Improvement Act of 2000''.

SEC. 702. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Missouri River is--
                    (A) an invaluable economic, environmental, 
                recreational, and cultural resource to the people of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) a critical source of water for drinking and 
                irrigation;
            (2) millions of people fish, hunt, and camp along the 
        Missouri River each year;
            (3) thousands of sites of spiritual importance to Native 
        Americans line the shores of the Missouri River;
            (4) the Missouri River provides critical wildlife habitat 
        for threatened and endangered species;
            (5) in 1944, Congress approved the Pick-Sloan program--
                    (A) to promote the general economic development of 
                the United States;
                    (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, 
                Iowa;
                    (C) to protect urban and rural areas from 
                devastating floods of the Missouri River; and
                    (D) for other purposes;
            (6) the Garrison Dam was constructed on the Missouri River 
        in North Dakota and the Oahe Dam was constructed in South Dakota 
        under the Pick-Sloan program;
            (7) the dams referred to in paragraph (6)--
                    (A) generate low-cost electricity for millions of 
                people in the United States;
                    (B) provide revenue to the Treasury; and
                    (C) provide flood control that has prevented 
                billions of dollars of damage;

[[Page 114 STAT. 2695]]

            (8) the Garrison and Oahe Dams have reduced the ability of 
        the Missouri River to carry sediment downstream, resulting in 
        the accumulation of sediment in the reservoirs known as Lake 
        Sakakawea and Lake Oahe;
            (9) the sediment depositions--
                    (A) cause shoreline flooding;
                    (B) destroy wildlife habitat;
                    (C) limit recreational opportunities;

        enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Secretary of the 
        Interior shall prohibit the issuance of new cabin site leases 
        within the Refuge, except as is necessary to consolidate with,

            (2) Determination; <<NOTE: Deadline.>> notice.--Not later

                Interior, determine individual cabin sites that are not 
                suitable for conveyance to a lessee because the cabin 
                sites are isolated so that conveyance of 1 or more of 
                the cabin sites would create an inholding that would 
                impair management of the Refuge; and
                    (ii) with the concurrence of the Secretary of the 
                Interior and the lessee, determine individual cabin 
                sites that are not suitable for conveyance to a lessee 
                for any other reason that adversely impacts the future 
                habitability of the cabin sites; and

                estimate of the portion of administrative costs that 
                would be required to be reimbursed to the Secretary 
                under section 808(b), to--

            (3) Offer of comparable cabin site.--If the Secretary 
        determines that a cabin site is not suitable for conveyance to a

                submitted in such form as is required by the Secretary 
                under subsection (a)(2)(B).

SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Missouri River Restoration Act of 
2000''.

SEC. 902. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Missouri River is--
                    (A) an invaluable economic, environmental, 
                recreational, and cultural resource to the people of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) a critical source of water for drinking and 
                irrigation;
            (2) millions of people fish, hunt, and camp along the 
        Missouri River each year;
            (3) thousands of sites of spiritual importance to Native 
        Americans line the shores of the Missouri River;
            (4) the Missouri River provides critical wildlife habitat 
        for threatened and endangered species;
            (5) in 1944, Congress approved the Pick-Sloan program--
                    (A) to promote the general economic development of 
                the United States;
                    (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, 
                Iowa;
                    (C) to protect urban and rural areas from 
                devastating floods of the Missouri River; and
                    (D) for other purposes;
            (6) the Oahe, Big Bend, Fort Randall, and Gavins Point Dams 
        were constructed on the Missouri River in South Dakota under the 
        Pick-Sloan program;
            (7) the dams referred to in paragraph (6)--
                    (A) generate low-cost electricity for millions of 
                people in the United States;
                    (B) provide revenue to the Treasury; and
                    (C) provide flood control that has prevented 
                billions of dollars of damage;
            (8) the Oahe, Big Bend, Fort Randall, and Gavins Point Dams 
        have reduced the ability of the Missouri River to carry sediment 
        downstream, resulting in the accumulation of sediment in the 
        reservoirs known as Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, 
        and Lewis and Clark Lake;
            (9) the sediment depositions--
                    (A) cause shoreline flooding;
                    (B) destroy wildlife habitat;
                    (C) limit recreational opportunities;
                    (D) threaten the long-term ability of dams to 
                provide hydropower and flood control under the Pick-
                Sloan program;
                    (E) reduce water quality; and
                    (F) threaten intakes for drinking water and 
                irrigation; and
            (10) to meet the objectives established by Congress for the 
        Pick-Sloan program, it is necessary to establish a Missouri 
        River Restoration Program--
                    (A) to improve conservation;

[[Page 114 STAT. 2708]]

                    (B) to reduce the deposition of sediment; and
                    (C) to take other steps necessary for proper 
                management of the Missouri River.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to reduce the siltation of the Missouri River in the 
        State of South Dakota;
            (2) to meet the objectives of the Pick-Sloan program by 
        developing and implementing a long-term strategy--
                    (A) to improve conservation in the Missouri River 
                watershed;
                    (B) to protect recreation on the Missouri River from 
                sedimentation;
                    (C) to improve water quality in the Missouri River;
                    (D) to improve erosion control along the Missouri 
                River; and
                    (E) to protect Indian and non-Indian historical and 
                cultural sites along the Missouri River from erosion; 
                and
            (3) to meet the objectives described in paragraphs (1) and
