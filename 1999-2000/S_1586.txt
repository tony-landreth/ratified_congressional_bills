106th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To reduce the fractionated ownership of Indian lands, and for other 
             purposes. <<NOTE: Nov. 7, 2000 -  [S. 1586]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Indian Land Consolidation 
Act Amendments of 2000.>>  assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2201 note.>> 

    This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Land Consolidation Act 
Amendments of 2000''.

                   TITLE I--INDIAN LAND CONSOLIDATION

SEC. 101. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2201 note.>> 

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in the 1800's and early 1900's, the United States sought 
        to assimilate Indian people into the surrounding non-Indian 
        culture by allotting tribal lands to individual members of 
        Indian tribes;
            (2) as a result of the allotment Acts and related Federal 
        policies, over 90,000,000 acres of land have passed from tribal 
        ownership;
            (3) many trust allotments were taken out of trust status, 
        often without their owner's consent;
            (4) without restrictions on alienation, allotment owners 
        were subject to exploitation and their allotments were often 
        sold or disposed of without any tangible or enduring benefit to 
        their owners;
            (5) the trust periods for trust allotments have been 
        extended indefinitely;
            (6) because of the inheritance provisions in the original 
        treaties or allotment Acts, the ownership of many of the trust 
        allotments that have remained in trust status has become 
        fractionated into hundreds or thousands of undivided interests, 
        many of which represent 2 percent or less of the total 
        interests;
            (7) Congress has authorized the acquisition of lands in 
        trust for individual Indians, and many of those lands have also 
        become fractionated by subsequent inheritance;
            (8) the acquisitions referred to in paragraph (7) continue 
        to be made;
            (9) the fractional interests described in this section often 
        provide little or no return to the beneficial owners of those 
        interests and the administrative costs borne by the United 
        States for those interests are inordinately high;
            (10) in Babbitt v. Youpee (117 S Ct. 727 (1997)), the United 
        States Supreme Court found the application of section 207

[[Page 114 STAT. 1992]]

        of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206) to the 
        facts presented in that case to be unconstitutional, forcing the 
        Department of the Interior to address the status of thousands of 
        undivided interests in trust and restricted lands;
            (11)(A) on February 19, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior 
        issued a Secretarial Order which officially reopened the probate 
        of all estates where an interest in land was ordered to escheat 
        to an Indian tribe pursuant to section 207 of the Indian Land 
        Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2206); and
            (B) the Secretarial Order also directed appropriate 
        officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to distribute such 
        interests ``to the rightful heirs and beneficiaries without 
        regard to 25 U.S.C. 2206'';
            (12) in the absence of comprehensive remedial legislation, 
        the number of the fractional interests will continue to grow 
        exponentially;
            (13) the problem of the fractionation of Indian lands 
        described in this section is the result of a policy of the 
        Federal Government, cannot be solved by Indian tribes, and 
        requires a solution under Federal law.
            (14) any devise or inheritance of an interest in trust or 
        restricted Indian lands is a matter of Federal law; and
            (15) consistent with the Federal policy of tribal self-
        determination, the Federal Government should encourage the 
        recognized tribal government that exercises jurisdiction over a 
        reservation to establish a tribal probate code for that 
        reservation.

SEC. 102. DECLARATION OF POLICY. <<NOTE: 25 USC 2201 note.>> 

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to prevent the further fractionation of trust allotments 
        made to Indians;
            (2) to consolidate fractional interests and ownership of 
        those interests into usable parcels;
            (3) to consolidate fractional interests in a manner that 
        enhances tribal sovereignty;
            (4) to promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-
        determination; and
            (5) to reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian 
        tribes.
SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS <<NOTE: 25 USC 2201 note.>>  TO THE INDIAN 
                        LAND CONSOLIDATION ACT.

        determines that using such law's definition of Indian is 
        consistent with the purposes of this Act;'';
