``Sec. 983. General rules for civil forfeiture proceedings

    ``(a) <<NOTE: Deadlines.>>  Notice; Claim; Complaint.--
            ``(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in clauses (ii) through (v), 
        in any nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil 
        forfeiture statute, with respect to which the Government is 
        required to send written notice to interested parties, such 
        notice shall be sent in a manner to achieve proper notice as 
        soon as practicable, and in no case more than 60 days after the 
        date of the seizure.
            ``(ii) No notice is required if, before the 60-day period 
        expires, the Government files a civil judicial forfeiture action

[[Page 114 STAT. 203]]

        against the property and provides notice of that action as 
        required by law.
            ``(iii) If, before the 60-day period expires, the Government 
        does not file a civil judicial forfeiture action, but does 
        obtain a criminal indictment containing an allegation that the 
        property is subject to forfeiture, the Government shall either--
                    ``(I) send notice within the 60 days and continue 
                the nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under this 
                section; or
                    ``(II) terminate the nonjudicial civil forfeiture 
                proceeding, and take the steps necessary to preserve its 
                right to maintain custody of the property as provided in 
                the applicable criminal forfeiture statute.
            ``(iv) In a case in which the property is seized by a State 
        or local law enforcement agency and turned over to a Federal law 
        enforcement agency for the purpose of forfeiture under Federal 
        law, notice shall be sent not more than 90 days after the date 
        of seizure by the State or local law enforcement agency.
            ``(v) If the identity or interest of a party is not 
        determined until after the seizure or turnover but is determined 
        before a declaration of forfeiture is entered, notice shall be 
        sent to such interested party not later than 60 days after the 
        determination by the Government of the identity of the party or 
        the party's interest.
            ``(B) A supervisory official in the headquarters office of 
        the seizing agency may extend the period for sending notice 
        under subparagraph (A) for a period not to exceed 30 days (which 
        period may not be further extended except by a court), if the 
        official determines that the conditions in subparagraph (D) are 
        present.
            ``(C) Upon motion by the Government, a court may extend the 
        period for sending notice under subparagraph (A) for a period 
        not to exceed 60 days, which period may be further extended by 
        the court for 60-day periods, as necessary, if the court 
        determines, based on a written certification of a supervisory 
        official in the headquarters office of the seizing agency, that 
        the conditions in subparagraph (D) are present.
            ``(D) The period for sending notice under this paragraph may 
        be extended only if there is reason to believe that notice may 
        have an adverse result, including--
                    ``(i) endangering the life or physical safety of an 
                individual;
                    ``(ii) flight from prosecution;
                    ``(iii) destruction of or tampering with evidence;
                    ``(iv) intimidation of potential witnesses; or
                    ``(v) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an 
                investigation or unduly delaying a trial.
            ``(E) Each of the Federal seizing agencies conducting 
        nonjudicial forfeitures under this section shall report 
        periodically to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate the number of occasions when an 
        extension of time is granted under subparagraph (B).
            ``(F) If the Government does not send notice of a seizure of 
        property in accordance with subparagraph (A) to the person from 
        whom the property was seized, and no extension of time is 
        granted, the Government shall return the property to that person 
        without prejudice to the right of the Government to

[[Page 114 STAT. 204]]

        commence a forfeiture proceeding at a later time. The Government 
        shall not be required to return contraband or other property 
        that the person from whom the property was seized may not 
        legally possess.
            ``(2)(A) Any person claiming property seized in a 
        nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture 
        statute may file a claim with the appropriate official after the 
        seizure.
            ``(B) A claim under subparagraph (A) may be filed not later 
        than the deadline set forth in a personal notice letter (which 
        deadline may be not earlier than 35 days after the date the 
        letter is mailed), except that if that letter is not received, 
        then a claim may be filed not later than 30 days after the date 
        of final publication of notice of seizure.
            ``(C) A claim shall--
                    ``(i) identify the specific property being claimed;
                    ``(ii) state the claimant's interest in such 
                property (and provide customary documentary evidence of 
                such interest if available) and state that the claim is 
                not frivolous; and
                    ``(iii) be made under oath, subject to penalty of 
                perjury.
            ``(D) A claim need not be made in any particular form. Each 
        Federal agency conducting nonjudicial forfeitures under this 
        section shall make claim forms generally available on request, 
        which forms shall be written in easily understandable language.
            ``(E) Any person may make a claim under subparagraph (A) 
        without posting bond with respect to the property which is the 
        subject of the claim.
            ``(3)(A) Not later than 90 days after a claim has been 
        filed, the Government shall file a complaint for forfeiture in 
        the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain 
        Admiralty and Maritime Claims or return the property pending the 
        filing of a complaint, except that a court in the district in 
        which the complaint will be filed may extend the period for 
        filing a complaint for good cause shown or upon agreement of the 
        parties.
            ``(B) <<NOTE: Regulations.>>  If the Government does not--
                    ``(i) file a complaint for forfeiture or return the 
                property, in accordance with subparagraph (A); or
                    ``(ii) before the time for filing a complaint has 
                expired--

                      an allegation that the property is subject to 
                      forfeiture; and

                      its right to maintain custody of the property as 
                      provided in the applicable criminal forfeiture 
                      statute,
        the Government shall promptly release the property pursuant to 
        regulations promulgated by the Attorney General, and may not 
        take any further action to effect the civil forfeiture of such 
        property in connection with the underlying offense.
            ``(C) In lieu of, or in addition to, filing a civil 
        forfeiture complaint, the Government may include a forfeiture 
        allegation in a criminal indictment. If criminal forfeiture is 
        the only forfeiture proceeding commenced by the Government, the 
        Government's right to continued possession of the property shall 
        be governed by the applicable criminal forfeiture statute.
            ``(D) No complaint may be dismissed on the ground that the 
        Government did not have adequate evidence at the time

[[Page 114 STAT. 205]]

        the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the 
        property.
            ``(4)(A) In any case in which the Government files in the 
        appropriate United States district court a complaint for 
        forfeiture of property, any person claiming an interest in the 
        seized property may file a claim asserting such person's 
        interest in the property in the manner set forth in the 
        Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, 
        except that such claim may be filed not later than 30 days after 
        the date of service of the Government's complaint or, as 
        applicable, not later than 30 days after the date of final 
        publication of notice of the filing of the complaint.
            ``(B) A person asserting an interest in seized property, in 
        accordance with subparagraph (A), shall file an answer to the 
        Government's complaint for forfeiture not later than 20 days 
        after the date of the filing of the claim.

    ``(b) <<NOTE: Courts.>>  Representation.--
            ``(1)(A) If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture 
        of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a 
        civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain 
        representation by counsel, and the person is represented by 
        counsel appointed under section 3006A of this title in 
        connection with a related criminal case, the court may authorize 
        counsel to represent that person with respect to the claim.
            ``(B) In determining whether to authorize counsel to 
        represent a person under subparagraph (A), the court shall take 
        into account such factors as--
                    ``(i) the person's standing to contest the 
                forfeiture; and
                    ``(ii) whether the claim appears to be made in good 
                faith.
            ``(2)(A) If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture 
        of property in a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a 
        civil forfeiture statute is financially unable to obtain 
        representation by counsel, and the property subject to 
        forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as 
        a primary residence, the court, at the request of the person, 
        shall insure that the person is represented by an attorney for 
        the Legal Services Corporation with respect to the claim.
            ``(B)(i) At appropriate times during a representation under 
        subparagraph (A), the Legal Services Corporation shall submit a 
        statement of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the court.
            ``(ii) The court shall enter a judgment in favor of the 
        Legal Services Corporation for reasonable attorney fees and 
        costs submitted pursuant to clause (i) and treat such judgment 
        as payable under section 2465 of title 28, United States Code, 
        regardless of the outcome of the case.
            ``(3) The court shall set the compensation for 
        representation under this subsection, which shall be equivalent 
        to that provided for court-appointed representation under 
        section 3006A of this title.

    ``(c) Burden of Proof.--In a suit or action brought under any civil 
forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of any property--
            ``(1) the burden of proof is on the Government to establish, 
        by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject 
        to forfeiture;

[[Page 114 STAT. 206]]

            ``(2) the Government may use evidence gathered after the 
        filing of a complaint for forfeiture to establish, by a 
        preponderance of the evidence, that property is subject to 
        forfeiture; and
            ``(3) if the Government's theory of forfeiture is that the 
        property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a 
        criminal offense, or was involved in the commission of a 
        criminal offense, the Government shall establish that there was 
        a substantial connection between the property and the offense.

    ``(d) Innocent Owner Defense.--
            ``(1) An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be 
        forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The claimant shall 
        have the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent 
        owner by a preponderance of the evidence.
            ``(2)(A) With respect to a property interest in existence at 
        the time the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture took 
        place, the term `innocent owner' means an owner who--
                    ``(i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to 
                forfeiture; or
                    ``(ii) upon learning of the conduct giving rise to 
                the forfeiture, did all that reasonably could be 
                expected under the circumstances to terminate such use 
                of the property.
            ``(B)(i) For the purposes of this paragraph, ways in which a 
        person may show that such person did all that reasonably could 
        be expected may include demonstrating that such person, to the 
        extent permitted by law--
                    ``(I) gave timely notice to an appropriate law 
                enforcement agency of information that led the person to 
                know the conduct giving rise to a forfeiture would occur 
                or has occurred; and
                    ``(II) in a timely fashion revoked or made a good 
                faith attempt to revoke permission for those engaging in 
                such conduct to use the property or took reasonable 
                actions in consultation with a law enforcement agency to 
                discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property.
            ``(ii) A person is not required by this subparagraph to take 
        steps that the person reasonably believes would be likely to 
        subject any person (other than the person whose conduct gave 
        rise to the forfeiture) to physical danger.
            ``(3)(A) With respect to a property interest acquired after 
        the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture has taken place, the 
        term `innocent owner' means a person who, at the time that 
        person acquired the interest in the property--
                    ``(i) was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value 
                (including a purchaser or seller of goods or services 
                for value); and
                    ``(ii) did not know and was reasonably without cause 
                to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture.
            ``(B) <<NOTE: Courts.>>  An otherwise valid claim under 
        subparagraph (A) shall not be denied on the ground that the 
        claimant gave nothing of value in exchange for the property if--
                    ``(i) the property is the primary residence of the 
                claimant;
                    ``(ii) depriving the claimant of the property would 
                deprive the claimant of the means to maintain reasonable

[[Page 114 STAT. 207]]

                shelter in the community for the claimant and all 
                dependents residing with the claimant;
                    ``(iii) the property is not, and is not traceable 
                to, the proceeds of any criminal offense; and
                    ``(iv) the claimant acquired his or her interest in 
                the property through marriage, divorce, or legal 
                separation, or the claimant was the spouse or legal 
                dependent of a person whose death resulted in the 
                transfer of the property to the claimant through 
                inheritance or probate,
        except that the court shall limit the value of any real property 
        interest for which innocent ownership is recognized under this 
        subparagraph to the value necessary to maintain reasonable 
        shelter in the community for such claimant and all dependents 
        residing with the claimant.
            ``(4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, no 
        person may assert an ownership interest under this subsection in 
        contraband or other property that it is illegal to possess.
            ``(5) If the court determines, in accordance with this 
        section, that an innocent owner has a partial interest in 
        property otherwise subject to forfeiture, or a joint tenancy or 
        tenancy by the entirety in such property, the court may enter an 
        appropriate order--

                interest once a final order of forfeiture has been 
                entered and the property has been reduced to liquid

                the specific property sought to be forfeited, including 
                a leasehold, lien, mortgage, recorded security interest, 
                or valid assignment of an ownership interest; and

        nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture 
        statute who does not receive such notice may file a motion to

        claimant of an amount equal to 10 percent of the value of the 
        forfeited property, but in no event shall the fine be less than 
        $250 or greater than $5,000.

property is found, or transmitted to the central authority of any 
foreign state for service in accordance with any treaty or other 
international agreement. Any motion for the return of property seized

seizure warrant was issued or in the district court for the district in

magistrate judge in the district in which the property is located for an 
ex parte order restraining the property subject to forfeiture for not 
more than 30 days, except that the time may be extended for good cause 
shown at a hearing conducted

                forfeiture action shall not be seized before entry of an

                shall not be evicted from, or otherwise deprived of the 
                use and enjoyment of, real property that is the subject 
                of a pending forfeiture action.

        writ of entry for the purpose of conducting an inspection and

    ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), to establish exigent 
circumstances, the Government shall show that less restrictive measures

SEC. 8. STAY OF CIVIL FORFEITURE CASE.

    (a) In General.--Section 981(g) of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(g)(1) <<NOTE: Courts.>>  Upon the motion of the United States, 
the court shall stay the civil forfeiture proceeding if the court 
determines that civil discovery will adversely affect the ability of the 
Government to conduct a related criminal investigation or the 
prosecution of a related criminal case.

[[Page 114 STAT. 216]]

    ``(2) Upon the motion of a claimant, the court shall stay the civil 
forfeiture proceeding with respect to that claimant if the court 
determines that--
            ``(A) the claimant is the subject of a related criminal 
        investigation or case;
            ``(B) the claimant has standing to assert a claim in the 
        civil forfeiture proceeding; and
            ``(C) continuation of the forfeiture proceeding will burden 
        the right of the claimant against self-incrimination in the 
        related investigation or case.

    ``(3) With respect to the impact of civil discovery described in 
paragraphs (1) and (2), the court may determine that a stay is 
unnecessary if a protective order limiting discovery would protect the 
interest of one party without unfairly limiting the ability of the 
opposing party to pursue the civil case. In no case, however, shall the 
court impose a protective order as an alternative to a stay if the 
effect of such protective order would be to allow one party to pursue 
discovery while the other party is substantially unable to do so.
    ``(4) In this subsection, the terms `related criminal case' and 
`related criminal investigation' mean an actual prosecution or 
investigation in progress at the time at which the request for the stay, 
or any subsequent motion to lift the stay is made. In determining 
whether a criminal case or investigation is `related' to a civil 
forfeiture proceeding, the court shall consider the degree of similarity 
between the parties, witnesses, facts, and circumstances involved in the 
two proceedings, without requiring an identity with respect to any one 
or more factors.
    ``(5) In requesting a stay under paragraph (1), the Government may, 
in appropriate cases, submit evidence ex parte in order to avoid 
disclosing any matter that may adversely affect an ongoing criminal 
investigation or pending criminal trial.
    ``(6) Whenever a civil forfeiture proceeding is stayed pursuant to 
this subsection, the court shall enter any order necessary to preserve 
the value of the property or to protect the rights of lienholders or 
other persons with an interest in the property while the stay is in 
effect.
    ``(7) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  A determination by the court that 
the claimant has standing to request a stay pursuant to paragraph (2) 
shall apply only to this subsection and shall not preclude the 
Government from objecting to the standing of the claimant by dispositive 
motion or at the time of trial.''.

    (b) Drug Forfeitures.--Section 511(i) of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 U.S.C. 881(i)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(i) <<NOTE: Applicability.>>  The provisions of section 981(g) of 
title 18, United States Code, regarding the stay of a civil forfeiture 
proceeding shall apply to forfeitures under this section.''.

SEC. 9. CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDERS.

    Section 983 of title 18, United States Code, as added by this Act, 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``( j) Restraining Orders; Protective Orders.--
            ``(1) Upon application of the United States, the court may 
        enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution 
        of satisfactory performance bonds, create receiverships, appoint 
        conservators, custodians, appraisers, accountants, or trustees,

[[Page 114 STAT. 217]]

        or take any other action to seize, secure, maintain, or preserve 
        the availability of property subject to civil forfeiture--
                    ``(A) upon the filing of a civil forfeiture 
                complaint alleging that the property with respect to 
                which the order is sought is subject to civil 
                forfeiture; or
                    ``(B) prior to the filing of such a complaint, if, 
                after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in 
                the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court 
                determines that--
                          ``(i) there is a substantial probability that 
                      the United States will prevail on the issue of 
                      forfeiture and that failure to enter the order 
                      will result in the property being destroyed, 
                      removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or 
                      otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and
                          ``(ii) the need to preserve the availability 
                      of the property through the entry of the requested 
                      order outweighs the hardship on any party against 
                      whom the order is to be entered.
            ``(2) An order entered pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be 
        effective for not more than 90 days, unless extended by the 
        court for good cause shown, or unless a complaint described in 
        paragraph (1)(A) has been filed.
            ``(3) A temporary restraining order under this subsection 
        may be entered upon application of the United States without 
        notice or opportunity for a hearing when a complaint has not yet 
        been filed with respect to the property, if the United States 
        demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the 
        property with respect to which the order is sought is subject to 
        civil forfeiture and that provision of notice will jeopardize 
        the availability of the property for 
        forfeiture. <<NOTE: Expiration date.>>  Such a temporary order 
        shall expire not more than 10 days after the date on which it is 
        entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the 
        party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a 
        longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered 
        under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest possible time 
        and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
            ``(4) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held 
        pursuant to this subsection, evidence and information that would 
        be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.''.
