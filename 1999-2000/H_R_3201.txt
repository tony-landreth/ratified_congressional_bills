Historic Site Study Act of 2000''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Dr. Carter G. Woodson, cognizant of the widespread 
        ignorance and scanty information concerning the history of 
        African Americans, founded on September 9, 1915, the Association 
        for the Study of Negro Life and History, since renamed the 
        Association for the Study of African-American Life and History.
            (2) The Association was founded in particular to counter 
        racist propaganda alleging black inferiority and the pervasive 
        influence of Jim Crow prevalent at the time.
            (3) The mission of the Association was and continues to be 
        educating the American public of the contributions of Black 
        Americans in the formation of the Nation's history and culture.
            (4) Dr. Woodson dedicated nearly his entire adult life to 
        every aspect of the Association's operations in furtherance of 
        its mission.
            (5) Among the notable accomplishments of the Association 
        under Dr. Woodson's leadership, Negro History Week was 
        instituted in 1926 to be celebrated annually during the second 
        week of February. Negro History Week has since evolved into 
        Black History Month.
            (6) The headquarters and center of operations of the 
        Association was Dr. Woodson's residence, located at 1538 Ninth 
        Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C.
