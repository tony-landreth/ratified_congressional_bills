    This Act may be cited as the ``El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro 
National Historic Trail Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro (the Royal Road of the 
        Interior), served as the primary route between the colonial 
        Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial 
        capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros (1598-1600), San Gabriel 
        (1600-1609) and then Santa Fe (1610-1821).
            (2) The portion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro that 
        resided in what is now the United States extended between El 
        Paso, Texas and present San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico, a distance 
        of 404 miles;
            (3) El Camino Real is a symbol of the cultural interaction 
        between nations and ethnic groups and of the commercial exchange 
        that made possible the development and growth of the borderland;
            (4) American Indian groups, especially the Pueblo Indians of 
        the Rio Grande, developed trails for trade long before Europeans 
        arrived;
            (5) In 1598, Juan de Onate led a Spanish military expedition 
        along those trails to establish the northern portion of El 
        Camino Real;
            (6) During the Mexican National Period and part of the 
        United States Territorial Period, El Camino Real de Tierra 
        Adentro facilitated the emigration of people to New Mexico and 
        other areas that would become the United States;
            (7) The exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, 
        religious conversion, and military occupation of a large area of 
        the borderlands was made possible by this route, whose 
        historical period extended from 1598 to 1882;

[[Page 114 STAT. 1075]]

            (8) American Indians, European emigrants, miners, ranchers, 
        soldiers, and missionaries used El Camino Real during the 
        historic development of the borderlands. These travelers 
        promoted cultural interaction among Spaniards, other Europeans, 
        American Indians, Mexicans, and Americans;
            (9) El Camino Real fostered the spread of Catholicism, 
        mining, an extensive network of commerce, and ethnic and 
        cultural traditions including music, folklore, medicine, foods, 
        architecture, language, place names, irrigation systems, and 
        Spanish law.
