TITLE <<NOTE: Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 2000.>> II--CLINICAL 
RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT

SEC. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Clinical Research Enhancement Act 
of 2000''.

SEC. <<NOTE: 42 USC 284k note.>> 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of 
        scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and 
        improved treatment for disease.
            (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new 
        insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, 
        creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.
            (3) Clinical research includes translational research which 
        is an integral part of the research process leading to general 
        human applications. It is the bridge between the laboratory and 
        new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and is thus 
        essential to progress against cancer and other diseases.
            (4) The United States will spend more than 
        $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal 
        budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health 
        was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.
            (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National 
        Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all 
        addressed the current problems in clinical research.
            (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has 
        recognized the current problems in clinical research and 
        appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support 
        for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research 
        programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and 
        retain clinical investigators.
            (7) The current level of training and support for health 
        professionals in clinical research is fragmented, undervalued, 
        and underfunded.
            (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future 
        positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas 
        in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific 
        enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science 
        research are raised by the following:
                    (A) The number of young investigators applying for 
                grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.
                    (B) The number of physicians applying for first-time 
                National Institutes of Health research project grants 
                fell from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent 
                reduction.
                    (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected 
                to raise funds to support their new research programs 
                and a substantial proportion of their own salaries.
            (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the decline 
        in the number of active clinical researchers, and those choosing 
        this career path:
                    (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt 
                of $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation 
                Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical 
                Colleges (AAMC).

[[Page 114 STAT. 2326]]

                    (B) The prolonged period of clinical training 
                required increases the accumulated debt burden.
                    (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role 
                models.
                    (D) The perceived instability of funding from the 
                National Institutes of Health and other Federal 
                agencies.
                    (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research 
                training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.
                    (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing 
                difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for 
                research in a highly competitive health care 
                marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased 
                willingness of third party payers to cover health care 
                costs for patients engaged in research studies and 
                research procedures.
            (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were 
        established under the Office of the Director of the National 
        Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of 
        $3,000,000.
            (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers in 
        fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.
            (12) Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical 
        research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to 1 
        percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.
            (13) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical 
        research centers in operation, supplying patients in the areas 
        in which such centers operate with access to the most modern 
        clinical research and clinical research facilities and 
        technologies.

    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide additional 
support for and to expand clinical research programs.

SEC. 206. DEFINITION.

    Section 409 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284d) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``For purposes'' and inserting ``(a) Health 
        Service Research.--For purposes''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(b) Clinical Research.--As used in this title, the term `clinical 
research' means patient oriented clinical research conducted with human 
subjects, or research on the causes and consequences of disease in human 
populations involving material of human origin (such as tissue specimens 
and cognitive phenomena) for which an investigator or colleague directly 
interacts with human subjects in an outpatient or inpatient setting to 
clarify a problem in human

SEC. <<NOTE: Deadline. 42 USC 284k note.>> 207. OVERSIGHT BY GENERAL 
            ACCOUNTING OFFICE.

    Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the 
Congress a reporting describing the extent to which the National 
Institutes of Health has complied with the amendments made by this 
title.

  TITLE <<NOTE: Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act.>> III--
RESEARCH LABORATORY INFRASTRUCTURE

SEC. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Twenty-First Century Research 
Laboratories Act''.

SEC. 302. <<NOTE: 42 USC 287a-2 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the National Institutes of Health is the principal 
        source of Federal funding for medical research at universities 
        and other research institutions in the United States;
            (2) the National Institutes of Health has received a 
        substantial increase in research funding from Congress for the 
        purpose of expanding the national investment of the United 
        States in behavioral and biomedical research;
            (3) the infrastructure of our research institutions is 
        central to the continued leadership of the United States in 
        medical research;
            (4) as Congress increases the investment in cutting-edge 
        basic and clinical research, it is critical that Congress also 
        examine the current quality of the laboratories and buildings 
        where research is being conducted, as well as the quality of 
        laboratory equipment used in research;
            (5) many of the research facilities and laboratories in the 
        United States are outdated and inadequate;
            (6) the National Science Foundation found, in a 1998 report 
        on the status of biomedical research facilities, that over 60 
        percent of research-performing institutions indicated that they 
        had an inadequate amount of medical research space;
            (7) the National Science Foundation reports that academic 
        institutions have deferred nearly $11,000,000,000 in renovation 
        and construction projects because of a lack of funds; and
            (8) future increases in Federal funding for the National 
        Institutes of Health must include increased support for the 
        renovation and construction of extramural research facilities in 
        the United States and the purchase of state-of-the-art 
        laboratory instrumentation.

SEC. 303. BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH FACILITIES.

    Section 481A of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287a-2 et 
seq.) is amended to read as follows:

TITLE <<NOTE: Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 2000.>> IV--CARDIAC ARREST 
SURVIVAL

            Subtitle A--Recommendations for Federal Buildings

SEC. 401. <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act of 
2000''.

SEC. <<NOTE: 42 USC 238p note.>> 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Over 700 lives are lost every day to sudden cardiac 
        arrest in the United States alone.
            (2) Two out of every three sudden cardiac deaths occur 
        before a victim can reach a hospital.
            (3) More than 95 percent of these cardiac arrest victims 
        will die, many because of lack of readily available life saving 
        medical equipment.
            (4) With current medical technology, up to 30 percent of 
        cardiac arrest victims could be saved if victims had access to 
        immediate medical response, including defibrillation and 
        cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
            (5) Once a victim has suffered a cardiac arrest, every 
        minute that passes before returning the heart to a normal rhythm 
        decreases the chance of survival by 10 percent.
            (6) Most cardiac arrests are caused by abnormal heart 
        rhythms called ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular 
        fibrillation occurs when the heart's electrical system 
        malfunctions, causing

[[Page 114 STAT. 2337]]

        a chaotic rhythm that prevents the heart from pumping oxygen to 
        the victim's brain and body.
            (7) Communities that have implemented programs ensuring 
        widespread public access to defibrillators, combined with 
        appropriate training, maintenance, and coordination with local 
        emergency medical systems, have dramatically improved the 
        survival rates from cardiac arrest.
            (8) Automated external defibrillator devices have been 
        demonstrated to be safe and effective, even when used by lay 
        people, since the devices are designed not to allow a user to 
        administer a shock until after the device has analyzed a 
        victim's heart rhythm and determined that an electric shock is 
        required.
            (9) Increasing public awareness regarding automated external 
        defibrillator devices and encouraging their use in Federal 
        buildings will greatly facilitate their adoption.
            (10) Limiting the liability of Good Samaritans and acquirers 
        of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency 
        situations may encourage the use of automated external 
        defibrillator devices, and result in saved lives.

        cardiac arrest and the initial medical response, including 
        defibrillation as necessary; and
            ``(3) consult with and counsel other Federal agencies where 
        such devices are to be used.

    ``(d) Date <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Certain for Establishing Guidelines

Access to Emergency Devices

SEC. 411. <<NOTE: 42 USC 254c note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Rural Access to Emergency 
Devices Act'' or the ``Rural AED Act''.

SEC. 412. <<NOTE: 42 USC 254c note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the 
        United States.

[[Page 114 STAT. 2341]]

            (2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 
        Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.
            (3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 
        percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart is 
        returned to normal rhythm.
            (4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in 
        ventricular fibrillation, and the only treatment for ventricular 
        fibrillation is defibrillation, prompt access to defibrillation 
        to return the heart to normal rhythm is essential.
            (5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external 
        defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay rescuers 
        to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple device to 
        shock the heart into normal rhythm.
            (6) Those people who are likely to be first on the scene of 
        a cardiac arrest situation in many communities, particularly 
        smaller and rural communities, lack sufficient numbers of 
        automated external defibrillators to respond to cardiac arrest 
        in a timely manner.
            (7) The American Heart Association estimates that more than 
        50,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators 
        were more widely available to designated responders.
            (8) Legislation should be enacted to encourage greater 
        public access to automated external defibrillators in 
        communities across the United States.

SEC. 413. <<NOTE: 42 USC 254c note.>> GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Rural Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, shall award grants to community partnerships 
that meet the requirements of subsection (b) to enable such partnerships 
to purchase equipment and provide training as provided for in subsection 
(c).
    (b) Community Partnerships.--A community partnership meets the 
requirements of this subsection if such partnership--
            (1) is composed of local emergency response entities such as 
        community training facilities, local emergency responders, fire 
        and rescue departments, police, community hospitals, and local 
        non-profit entities and for-profit entities concerned about 
        cardiac arrest survival rates;
            (2) evaluates the local community emergency response times 
        to assess whether they meet the standards established by 
        national public health organizations such as the American Heart 
        Association and the American Red Cross; and
            (3) submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an

        recognized training courses.

    (d) Report.--Not <<NOTE: Deadline.>> later than 4 years after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services

[[Page 114 STAT. 2342]]

shall prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a 
report containing data relating to whether the increased availability of 
defibrillators has affected survival rates in the communities in which 
grantees under this section operated. The procedures under which the 
Secretary obtains data and prepares the report under this subsection 
shall not impose an undue burden on program participants under this 
section.

    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out 
this section.

      TITLE V--LUPUS <<NOTE: Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 
2000.>> RESEARCH AND CARE

SEC. 501. SHORT <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Lupus Research and Care Amendments 
of 2000''.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 42 USC 285d-6a note.>> FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune 
        disease of particular concern to women;
            (2) lupus affects women nine times more often than men;
            (3) there are three main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a 
        serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the body; 
        discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects mainly the 
        skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain medications;
            (4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;
            (5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of 
        the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and can 
        be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus are 
        similar to those of many other diseases;
            (6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American women, 
        as the prevalence of the disease among such women is three times 
        the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in 250 
        African-American women between the ages of 15 and 65 develops 
        the disease;
            (7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and 
        2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and 
        that many more have undiagnosed cases;
            (8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, but 
        may lead to damaging side effects;
            (9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain and 
        fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and lead 
        normal lives; and
            (10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the 
        National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was 
        $33,000,000, which is less than one-half of 1 percent of the 
        budget for such Institutes.

                      Subtitle A--Research on Lupus

SEC. 511. EXPANSION AND INTENSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES.

 TITLE VII--ORGAN <<NOTE: Organ Procurement Organization Certification 
Act of 2000.>> PROCUREMENT AND DONATION

SEC. 701. ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATION CERTIFICATION.

    (a) Short <<NOTE: 42 USC 201 note.>> Title.--This section may be 
cited as the ``Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act of 
2000''.

    (b) Findings.--Congress <<NOTE: 42 USC 273 note.>> makes the 
following findings:
            (1) Organ procurement organizations play an important role 
        in the effort to increase organ donation in the United States.
            (2) The current process for the certification and 
        recertification of organ procurement organizations conducted by 
        the Department of Health and Human Services has created a level 
        of uncertainty that is interfering with the effectiveness of 
        organ procurement organizations in raising the level of organ 
        donation.
            (3) The General Accounting Office, the Institute of 
        Medicine, and the Harvard School of Public Health have 
        identified substantial limitations in the organ procurement 
        organization certification and recertification process and have 
        recommended changes in that process.
            (4) The limitations in the recertification process include:
                    (A) An exclusive reliance on population-based 
                measures of performance that do not account for the 
                potential in the population for organ donation and do 
                not permit consideration of other outcome and process 
                standards that would more accurately reflect the 
                relative capability and performance of each organ 
                procurement organization.
                    (B) A lack of due process to appeal to the Secretary 
                of Health and Human Services for recertification on 
                either substantive or procedural grounds.
            (5) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the 
        authority under section 1138(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Social Security

[[Page 114 STAT. 2347]]

        Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-8(b)(1)(A)(i)) to extend the period for 
        recertification of an organ procurement organization from 2 to 4 
        years on the basis of its past practices in order to avoid the 
        inappropriate disruption of the nation's organ system.
            (6) The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use the 
        extended period described in paragraph (5) for recertification 
        of all organ procurement organizations to--
                    (A) develop improved performance measures that would 
                reflect organ donor potential and interim outcomes, and 
                to test these measures to ensure that they accurately 
                measure performance differences among the organ 
                procurement organizations; and
                    (B) improve the overall certification process by 
                incorporating process as well as outcome performance 
                measures, and developing equitable processes for 
                appeals.

    (c) Certification and Recertification of Organ Procurement 
Organizations.--Section 371(b)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 273(b)(1)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (D) through (G) as 
        subparagraphs (E) through (H), respectively;
            (2) by realigning the margin of subparagraph (F) (as so 
        redesignated) so as to align with subparagraph (E) (as so 
        redesignated); and
            (3) by inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:
            ``(D) notwithstanding any other provision of law, has met 
        the other requirements of this section and has been certified or 
        recertified by the Secretary within the previous 4-year period

        procurement organization through a process that either--
                    ``(i) granted certification or recertification

                      donor potential and other related factors in each 
                      service area of qualified organ procurement

SEC. 702. DESIGNATION OF GIVE THANKS, GIVE LIFE DAY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--

[[Page 114 STAT. 2348]]

            (1) traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families to 
        take time out of their busy lives to come together and to give 
        thanks for the many blessings in their lives;
            (2) approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the 
        United States are given the gift of life each year through 
        transplantation surgery, made possible by the generosity of 
        organ and tissue donations;
            (3) more than 66,000 Americans are awaiting their chance to 
        prolong their lives by finding a matching donor;
            (4) nearly 5,000 of these patients each year (or 13 patients 
        each day) die while waiting for a donated heart, liver, kidney, 
        or other organ;
            (5) nationwide there are up to 15,000 potential donors 
        annually, but families' consent to donation is received for less 
        than 6,000;
            (6) the need for organ donations greatly exceeds the supply 
        available;
            (7) designation as an organ donor on a driver's license or 
        voter's registration is a valuable step, but does not ensure 
        donation when an occasion arises;
            (8) the demand for transplantation will likely increase in 
        the coming years due to the growing safety of transplantation 
        surgery due to improvements in technology and drug developments, 
        prolonged life expectancy, and increased prevalence of diseases 
        that may lead to organ damage and failure, including 
        hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C infection;
            (9) the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a 
        variety of racial and ethnic minorities, will continue to grow 
        in the coming years;
            (10) the final decision on whether a potential donor can 
        share the gift of life usually is made by surviving family 
        members regardless of the patient's initial intent;
            (11) many Americans have indicated a willingness to donate 
        their organs and tissues but have not discussed this critical 
        matter with the family members who are most likely to make the 
        decision, if the occasion arises, as to whether that person will 
        be an organ and tissue donor;
            (12) some family members may be reluctant to give consent to 
        donate their deceased loved one's organs and tissues at a very 
        difficult and emotional time if that person has not clearly 
        expressed a desire or willingness to do so;
            (13) the vast majority of Americans are likely to spend part 
        of Thanksgiving Day with some of those family members who would 
        be approached to make such a decision; and
            (14) it is fitting for families to spend a portion of that 
        day discussing how they might give life to others on a day 
        devoted to giving thanks for their own blessings.

    (b) Designation.--November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, is hereby 
designated as a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' and to discuss organ 
and tissue donation with other family members so that informed decisions 
can be made if the occasion to donate arises.
