Secretary, any adjustment shall take effect on the first day of the

                        CARE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Pertinent military experiences and exposures may affect 
        the health status of Department of Veterans Affairs patients who 
        are veterans.
            (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs has begun to 
        implement a Veterans Health Initiative to develop systems to 
        ensure that both patient care and medical education in the 
        Veterans Health Administration are specific to the special needs 
        of veterans and should be encouraged to continue these efforts.
            (3) Protocols eliciting pertinent information relating to 
        the military history of veterans may be beneficial to 
        understanding certain conditions for which veterans may be at 
        risk and thereby facilitate the treatment of veterans for those 
        conditions.
            (4) The Department of Veterans Affairs is in the process of 
        developing a Computerized Patient Record System that offers the 
        potential to aid in the care and monitoring of such conditions.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) urges the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to assess the 
        feasibility and desirability of using a computer-based system to 
        conduct clinical evaluations relevant to military experiences 
        and exposures; and
            (2) recommends that the Secretary accelerate efforts within 
        the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that relevant 
        military histories of veterans are included in Department 
        medical records.

SEC. 223. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 
                        DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE 
                        DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN THE PROCUREMENT 
                        OF MEDICAL ITEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The procurement and distribution of medical items, 
        including prescription drugs, is a multibillion-dollar annual 
        business for both the Department of Defense and the Department 
        of Veterans Affairs.
            (2) Those departments prescribe common high-use drugs to 
        many of their 12,000,000 patients who have similar medical 
        profiles.
            (3) The health care systems of those departments should have 
        management systems that can share and communicate clinical and 
        management information useful for both systems.
            (4) The institutional barriers separating the two 
        departments have begun to be overcome in the area of medical 
        supplies, in part as a response to recommendations by the 
        General Accounting Office and the Commission on Servicemembers 
        and Veterans Transition Assistance.
            (5) There is significant potential for improved savings and 
        services by improving cooperation between the two departments in 
        the procurement and management of prescription drugs, while 
        remaining mindful that the two departments have different 
        missions.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs should 
increase, to the maximum extent consistent with their respective 
missions, their level of cooperation in the procurement and management 
of prescription drugs.
