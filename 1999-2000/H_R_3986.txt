                engineering feasibility of exchanging water from the

                Yakima River.
                    ``(B) Requirements.--In carrying out subparagraph

                          ``(i) prepare a report that describes project 
                      benefits and contains feasibility level designs 
                      and cost estimates;
                          ``(ii) secure the critical right-of-way areas 
                      for the pipeline alignment;

            (2) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``or water
