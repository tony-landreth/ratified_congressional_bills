                from the base quality for the agricultural commodity.
            ``(3) Review of criteria and procedures.--The Corporation 
        shall contract with a qualified person to review the quality 
        loss adjustment procedures of the Corporation so that the 
        procedures more accurately reflect local quality discounts that 
        are applied to agricultural commodities insured under this 
        title. Based on the review, the Corporation shall make 
        adjustments in the procedures, taking into consideration the 
        actuarial soundness of the adjustment and the prevention of 
        fraud, waste, and abuse.''.

   TITLE III--BIOMASS <<NOTE: Biomass Research and Development Act of 
2000.>> RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000

SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7624 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Biomass Research and Development 
Act of 2000''.

SEC. 302. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7624 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) conversion of biomass into biobased industrial products 
        offers outstanding potential for benefit to the national 
        interest through--
                    (A) improved strategic security and balance of 
                payments;
                    (B) healthier rural economies;
                    (C) improved environmental quality;
                    (D) near-zero net greenhouse gas emissions;
                    (E) technology export; and
                    (F) sustainable resource supply;
            (2) the key technical challenges to be overcome in order for 
        biobased industrial products to be cost-competitive are finding 
        new technology and reducing the cost of technology for 
        converting biomass into desired biobased industrial products;
            (3) biobased fuels, such as ethanol, have the clear 
        potential to be sustainable, low cost, and high performance 
        fuels that are compatible with both current and future 
        transportation systems and provide near-zero net greenhouse gas 
        emissions;
            (4) biobased chemicals have the clear potential for 
        environmentally benign product life cycles;
            (5) biobased power can--
                    (A) provide environmental benefits;
                    (B) promote rural economic development; and
                    (C) diversify energy resource options;
            (6) many biomass feedstocks suitable for industrial 
        processing show the clear potential for sustainable production, 
        in some cases resulting in improved soil fertility and carbon 
        sequestration;
            (7)(A) grain processing mills are biorefineries that produce 
        a diversity of useful food, chemical, feed, and fuel products; 
        and
            (B) technologies that result in further diversification of 
        the range of value-added biobased industrial products can meet a 
        key need for the grain processing industry;
            (8)(A) cellulosic feedstocks are attractive because of their 
        low cost and widespread availability; and
            (B) research resulting in cost-effective technology to 
        overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass would allow 
        biorefineries to produce fuels and bulk chemicals on a very 
        large scale, with a commensurately large realization of the 
        benefit described in paragraph (1);
            (9) research into the fundamentals to understand important 
        mechanisms of biomass conversion can be expected to accelerate

[[Page 114 STAT. 429]]

        the application and advancement of biomass processing technology 
        by--
                    (A) increasing the confidence and speed with which 
                new technologies can be scaled up; and
                    (B) giving rise to processing innovations based on 
                new knowledge;
            (10) the added utility of biobased industrial products 
        developed through improvements in processing technology would 
        encourage the design of feedstocks that would meet future needs 
        more effectively;
            (11) the creation of value-added biobased industrial 
        products would create new jobs in construction, manufacturing, 
        and distribution, as well as new higher-valued exports of 
        products and technology;
            (12)(A) because of the relatively short-term time horizon 
        characteristic of private sector investments, and because many 
        benefits of biomass processing are in the national interest, it 
        is appropriate for the Federal Government to provide 
        precommercial investment in fundamental research and research-
        driven innovation in the biomass processing area; and
            (B) such an investment would provide a valuable complement 
        to ongoing and past governmental support in the biomass 
        processing area; and
            (13) several prominent studies, including studies by the 
        President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology and 
        the National Research Council--
                    (A) support the potential for large research-driven 
                advances in technologies for production of biobased 
                industrial products as well as associated benefits; and
                    (B) document the need for a focused, integrated, and 
                innovation-driven research effort to provide the 
                appropriate progress in a timely manner.

       TITLE IV--PLANT <<NOTE: Plant Protection Act. Commerce and 
trade. Exports and imports.>> PROTECTION ACT

SEC. 401. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7701 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Plant Protection Act''.

SEC. 402. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7701.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the detection, control, eradication, suppression, 
        prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or 
        noxious weeds is necessary for the protection of the 
        agriculture, environment, and economy of the United States;
            (2) biological control is often a desirable, low-risk means 
        of ridding crops and other plants of plant pests and noxious 
        weeds, and its use should be facilitated by the Department of 
        Agriculture, other Federal agencies, and States whenever 
        feasible;
            (3) it is the responsibility of the Secretary to facilitate 
        exports, imports, and interstate commerce in agricultural 
        products and other commodities that pose a risk of harboring 
        plant pests or noxious weeds in ways that will reduce, to the 
        extent practicable, as determined by the Secretary, the risk of 
        dissemination of plant pests or noxious weeds;
            (4) decisions affecting imports, exports, and interstate 
        movement of products regulated under this title shall be based 
        on sound science;
            (5) the smooth movement of enterable plants, plant products, 
        biological control organisms, or other articles into, out of, or 
        within the United States is vital to the United State's economy 
        and should be facilitated to the extent possible;
            (6) export markets could be severely impacted by the 
        introduction or spread of plant pests or noxious weeds into or 
        within the United States;
            (7) the unregulated movement of plant pests, noxious weeds, 
        plants, certain biological control organisms, plant products, 
        and articles capable of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds 
        could present an unacceptable risk of introducing or spreading 
        plant pests or noxious weeds;
            (8) the existence on any premises in the United States of a 
        plant pest or noxious weed new to or not known to be widely 
        prevalent in or distributed within and throughout the United 
        States could constitute a threat to crops and other plants or 
        plant products of the United States and burden interstate 
        commerce or foreign commerce; and
            (9) all plant pests, noxious weeds, plants, plant products, 
        articles capable of harboring plant pests or noxious weeds 
        regulated under this title are in or affect interstate commerce 
        or foreign commerce.
