To amend the National Trails <<NOTE: Nov. 13, 2000 -  [S. 700]>> System 
  Act to designate the Ala Kahakai Trail as a National Historic Trail.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1241 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) <<NOTE: Hawaii.>> the Ala Kahakai (Trail by the Sea) is 
        an important part of the ancient trail known as the ``Ala Loa'' 
        (the long trail), which circumscribes the island of Hawaii;
            (2) the Ala Loa was the major land route connecting 600 or 
        more communities of the island kingdom of Hawaii from 1400 to 
        1700;
            (3) the trail is associated with many prehistoric and 
        historic housing areas of the island of Hawaii, nearly all the 
        royal centers, and most of the major temples of the island;
            (4) the use of the Ala Loa is also associated with many 
        rulers of the kingdom of Hawaii, with battlefields and the 
        movement of armies during their reigns, and with annual 
        taxation;
            (5) the use of the trail played a significant part in events 
        that affected Hawaiian history and culture, including--
                    (A) Captain Cook's landing and subsequent death in 
                1779;
                    (B) Kamehameha I's rise to power and consolidation 
                of the Hawaiian Islands under monarchical rule; and
                    (C) the death of Kamehameha in 1819, followed by the 
                overthrow of the ancient religious system, the Kapu, and 
                the arrival of the first western missionaries in 1820; 
                and
            (6) the trail--
                    (A) was used throughout the 19th and 20th centuries 
                and continues in use today; and
                    (B) contains a variety of significant cultural and 
                natural resources.
