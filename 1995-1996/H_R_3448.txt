                      not exceed the amount included in the taxpayer's

SEC. 1906. MODIFICATION OF RULES RELATING TO FOREIGN TRUSTS WHICH 
                          ARE NOT GRANTOR TRUSTS.

    (a) Modification of Interest Charge on Accumulation Distributions.--
Subsection (a) of section 668 (relating to interest charge on 
accumulation distributions from foreign trusts) is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) General Rule.--For purposes of the tax determined under 
section 667(a)--
            ``(1) Interest determined using underpayment rates.--The 
        interest charge determined under this section with respect to 
        any distribution is the amount of interest which would be 
        determined on the partial tax computed under section 667(b) for 
        the period described in paragraph (2) using the rates and the 
        method under section 6621 applicable to underpayments of tax.
            ``(2) Period.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the period 
        described in this paragraph is the period which begins on the 
        date which is the applicable number of years before the date of 
        the distribution and which ends on the date of the distribution.
            ``(3) Applicable number of years.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (2)--
                    ``(A) In general.--The applicable number of years 
                with respect to a distribution is the number determined 
                by dividing--
                          ``(i) the sum of the products described in 
                      subparagraph (B) with respect to each 
                      undistributed income year, by
                          ``(ii) the aggregate undistributed net income.
                The quotient determined under the preceding sentence 
                shall be rounded under procedures prescribed by the 
                Secretary.
                    ``(B) Product described.--For purposes of sub-
                paragraph (A), the product described in this 
                subparagraph with respect to any undistributed income 
                year is the product of--
                          ``(i) the undistributed net income for such 
                      year, and
                          ``(ii) the sum of the number of taxable years 
                      between such year and the taxable year of the 
                      distribution (counting in each case the 
                      undistributed income year but not counting the 
                      taxable year of the distribution).
            ``(4) Undistributed income year.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `undistributed income year' means any prior 
        taxable year of the trust for which there is undistributed net 
        income, other than a taxable year during all of which the 
        beneficiary receiving the distribution was not a citizen or 
        resident of the United States.
            ``(5) Determination of undistributed net income.--
        Notwithstanding section 666, for purposes of this subsection, an 
        accumulation distribution from the trust shall be treated as 
        reducing proportionately the undistributed net income for 
        undistributed income years.
            ``(6) Periods before 1996.--Interest for the portion of the 
        period described in paragraph (2) which occurs before January 1, 
        1996, shall be determined--

[[Page 110 STAT. 1915]]

                    ``(A) by using an interest rate of 6 percent, and
                    ``(B) without compounding until January 1, 1996.''.

    (b) Abusive Transactions.--Section 643(a) is amended by inserting 
after paragraph (6) the following new paragraph:
            ``(7) Abusive transactions.--The Secretary shall prescribe 
        such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out 
        the purposes of this part, including regulations to prevent 
        avoidance of such purposes.''.

    (c) Treatment of Loans From Trusts.--
            (1) In general.--Section 643 (relating to definitions 
        applicable to subparts A, B, C, and D) is amended by adding at 
        the end the following new subsection:

    ``(i) Loans From Foreign Trusts.--For purposes of subparts B, C, and 
D--
            ``(1) General rule.--Except as provided in regulations, if a 
        foreign trust makes a loan of cash or marketable securities 
        directly or indirectly to--
                    ``(A) any grantor or beneficiary of such trust who 
                is a United States person, or
                    ``(B) any United States person not described in 
                subparagraph (A) who is related to such grantor or 
                beneficiary,
        the amount of such loan shall be treated as a distribution by 
        such trust to such grantor or beneficiary (as the case may be).
            ``(2) Definitions and special rules.--For purposes of this 
        subsection--
                    ``(A) Cash.--The term `cash' includes foreign 
                currencies and cash equivalents.
                    ``(B) Related person.--
                          ``(i) In general.--A person is related to 
                      another person if the relationship between such 
                      persons would result in a disallowance of losses 
                      under section 267 or 707(b). In applying section 
                      267 for purposes of the preceding sentence, 
                      section 267(c)(4) shall be applied as if the 
                      family of an individual includes the spouses of 
                      the members of the family.
                          ``(ii) Allocation.--If any person described in 
                      paragraph (1)(B) is related to more than one 
                      person, the grantor or beneficiary to whom the 
                      treatment under this subsection applies shall be 
                      determined under regulations prescribed by the 
                      Secretary.
                    ``(C) Exclusion of tax-exempts.--The term `United 
                States person' does not include any entity exempt from 
                tax under this chapter.
                    ``(D) Trust not treated as simple trust.--Any trust 
                which is treated under this subsection as making a 
                distribution shall be treated as not described in 
                section 651.
            ``(3) Subsequent transactions regarding loan principal.--If 
        any loan is taken into account under paragraph (1), any 
        subsequent transaction between the trust and the original 
        borrower regarding the principal of the loan (by way of complete 
        or partial repayment, satisfaction, cancellation, discharge, or 
        otherwise) shall be disregarded for purposes of this title.''.
