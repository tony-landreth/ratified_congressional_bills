        In developing lists, the Executive Director shall consider 
        candidates recommended by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
        Service or the Administrative Conference of the United States.

    (d) Hearing.--Unless a complaint is dismissed before a hearing, a

    (e) Discovery.--Reasonable prehearing discovery may be permitted at 
the discretion of the hearing officer.
    (f) Subpoenas.--
            (1) In general.--At the request of a party, a hearing 
        officer may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and 
        for the production of correspondence, books, papers, documents, 
        and other records. The attendance of witnesses and the 
        production of records may be required from any place within the 
        United States. Subpoenas shall be served in the manner provided 
        under rule 45(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
            (2) Objections.--If a person refuses, on the basis of 
        relevance, privilege, or other objection, to testify in response 
        to a question or to produce records in connection with a 
        proceeding before a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall 
        rule on the objection. At the request of the witness or any 
        party, the hearing officer shall (or on the hearing officer's 
        own initiative, the hearing officer may) refer the ruling to the 
        Board for review.
            (3) Enforcement.--
                    (A) In general.--If a person fails to comply with a 
                subpoena, the Board may authorize the General Counsel to 
                apply, in the name of the Office, to an appropriate 
                United States district court for an order requiring that 
                person to appear before the hearing officer to give 
                testimony or produce records. The application may be 
                made within the judicial district where the hearing is 
                conducted or where that person is found, resides, or 
                transacts business. Any failure to obey a lawful order 
                of the district court issued pursuant to this section 
                may be held by such court to be a civil contempt 
                thereof.
                    (B) Service of process.--Process in an action or 
                contempt proceeding pursuant to subparagraph (A) may be 
                served in any judicial district in which the person 
                refusing or failing to comply, or threatening to refuse 
                or not to

[[Page 109 STAT. 35]]

                comply, resides, transacts business, or may be found, 
                and subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend 
                such proceedings may run into any other district.

    (g) Decision.--The hearing officer shall issue a written decision as 
expeditiously as possible, but in no case more than 90 days after the 
conclusion of the hearing. The written decision shall be transmitted by 
the Office to the parties. The decision shall state the issues raised in 
the complaint, describe the evidence in the record, contain findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, contain a determination of whether a 
violation has occurred, and order such remedies as are appropriate 
pursuant to <<NOTE: Records.>> title II. The decision shall be entered
