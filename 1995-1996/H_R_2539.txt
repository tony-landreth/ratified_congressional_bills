    ``In regulating the railroad industry, it is the policy of the 
United States Government--
            ``(1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition 
        and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for 
        transportation by rail;
            ``(2) to minimize the need for Federal regulatory control 
        over the rail transportation system and to require fair and 
        expeditious regulatory decisions when regulation is required;
            ``(3) to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation 
        system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues, as 
        determined by the Board;
            ``(4) to ensure the development and continuation of a sound 
        rail transportation system with effective competition among rail 
        carriers and with other modes, to meet the needs of the public 
        and the national defense;
            ``(5) to foster sound economic conditions in transportation 
        and to ensure effective competition and coordination between 
        rail carriers and other modes;
            ``(6) to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence 
        of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues 
        which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system 
        and to attract capital;
            ``(7) to reduce regulatory barriers to entry into and exit 
        from the industry;
            ``(8) to operate transportation facilities and equipment 
        without detriment to the public health and safety;
            ``(9) to encourage honest and efficient management of 
        railroads;
            ``(10) to require rail carriers, to the maximum extent 
        practicable, to rely on individual rate increases, and to limit 
        the use of increases of general applicability;
            ``(11) to encourage fair wages and safe and suitable working 
        conditions in the railroad industry;

[[Page 109 STAT. 806]]

            ``(12) to prohibit predatory pricing and practices, to avoid 
        undue concentrations of market power, and to prohibit unlawful 
        discrimination;
            ``(13) to ensure the availability of accurate cost 
        information in regulatory proceedings, while minimizing the 
        burden on rail carriers of developing and maintaining the 
        capability of providing such information;
            ``(14) to encourage and promote energy conservation; and

this section on its own initiative or on application by the Secretary of 
Transportation or an interested party. The Board shall, within 90 days 
after receipt of any such application, determine whether to begin an 
appropriate proceeding. <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>> If the

alternative terms nor give the Board the authority

    ``(a) A through route established by a rail carrier must be 
reasonable. Divisions of joint rates by rail carriers must be made 
without unreasonable discrimination against a participating carrier and 
must be reasonable.
    ``(b) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not discriminate in its 
rates against a connecting line of another rail carrier providing 
transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part 
or unreasonably discriminate against that line in the distribution of 
traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper.

unless a rate is prohibited by a provision of this part, a rail carrier 
providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under 
this part may establish any rate for transportation or other service 
provided by the rail carrier.
    ``(d)(1) If the Board determines, under section 10707 of this title, 
that a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to 
which a particular rate applies, the rate established by such carrier 
for such transportation must be reasonable.

reasonable for purposes of this section, the Board shall give due 
consideration to--

        made to minimize such traffic;
            ``(B) the amount of traffic which contributes only 
        marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates 
        on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from 
        such traffic; and

adequate revenues, as established by the Board under section 10704(a)(2) 
of this title.

jurisdiction of the Board under this part, or that a classification, 
rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this part, the

a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed 
in the business. The Board shall make an adequate and continuing effort

the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, 
joint rates, the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which 
those routes must be operated, for a rail carrier providing 
transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.

not be inferred from evidence that two or more rail carriers acted

effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of 
transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.

    ``(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing 
transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part 
is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Board shall determine 
whether the rail carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over 
the transportation to which the rate applies. The Board may make that 
determination on its own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the 
Board that the rail carrier does not have market dominance is 
determinative in a proceeding under this part related to that rate or 
transportation unless changed or set aside by the Board or set aside by 
a court of competent jurisdiction.
    ``(c) When the Board finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier 
proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance 
over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine 
that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that 
transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not 
establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable 
maximum.
    ``(d)(1)(A) In making a determination under this section, the Board 
shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does 
not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate 
applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a 
revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less 
than 180 percent.

    ``(B) For purposes of this section, variable costs for a rail 
carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted 
costs, calculated using the Uniform Rail Costing System cost finding 
methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Board in lieu 
thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price 
levels in the region in which the carrier operates, with adjustments 
specified by the Board. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof 
under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance 
with this paragraph, but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of 
such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Board 
shall prescribe.
    ``(2) A finding by the Board that a rate charged by a rail carrier 
results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to 
which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than 180 percent does 
not establish a presumption that--

        dominance over such transportation; or

Railroad Costs (which index shall be compiled or verified by the Board, 
with appropriate adjustments to reflect the change in composition of 
railroad costs, including the quality and mix of material and labor) and 
the denominator of which is the same index for the fourth quarter of 
every fifth year, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1992.

States Government may transport property or individuals for the United 
States Government without charge or at a rate reduced from the 
applicable commercial rate. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41

Government can be obtained from a rail carrier lawfully operating in the 
area where the transportation would be provided.

    ``In order to encourage more efficient use of freight cars, 
notwithstanding any other provision of this part, rail carriers shall be 
permitted to establish premium charges for special services or special 
levels of services not otherwise applicable to the movement. The Board 
shall facilitate development of such charges so as to increase the 
utilization of equipment.

    ``(a)(1) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not subject a 
person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination.

    ``(2) For purposes of this section, a rail carrier engages in 
unreasonable discrimination when it charges or receives from a person a 
different compensation for a service rendered, or to be rendered, in 
transportation the rail carrier may perform under this part than it 
charges or receives from another person for performing a like and 
contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic

    ``A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall provide reasonable, 
proper, and equal facilities that are within its power to provide for 
the interchange of traffic between, and for the receiving, forwarding, 
and delivering of passengers and property to and from, its respective

when the transportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. 
When the shipper or consignor instructs the rail carrier transporting 
the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not 
having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for 
rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is 
otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be 
due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the 
delivering carrier before delivery of the property--
            ``(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and

        the place specified in the original bill of lading.

of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or 
consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the 
beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the 
bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The 
beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is 
reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its 
ultimate destination if the agent gave the rail carrier in the 
reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and 
address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the rail carrier, 
and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous 
information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property 
is liable for the additional rates.
    ``(b) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a 
shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of 
lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the 
transportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. When the 
shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the 
property, to the line-haul rail carrier that is to make ultimate 
delivery--

that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and 
for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if that 
party does not pay the rates required to be paid under paragraph (2) of 
this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice 
to the delivering rail carrier before delivery that the party is not the 
beneficial owner of the property and gives the rail carrier the name and 
address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those 
additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is 
made that gives the delivering rail carrier erroneous information about 
the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates 
regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property 
was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of 
property.

under subsection (a) of this section. That rail carrier must bring the 
action during the period provided in section 11705(a) of this title or

jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not enter a combination or 
arrangement to prevent the carriage of freight from being continuous 
from the place of shipment to the place of destination whether by change 
of time schedule, carriage in different cars, or by other means. The 
carriage of freight by those rail carriers is considered to be a 
continuous carriage from the place of shipment to the place of 
destination when a break of bulk, stoppage, or interruption is not made 
in good faith for a necessary purpose, and with the intent of avoiding 
or unnecessarily interrupting the continuous carriage or of evading this 
part.

``Sec. 10745. Transportation services or facilities furnished by shipper

    ``A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Board under this part may establish a charge or 
allowance for transportation or service for property when the owner of 
the property, directly or indirectly, furnishes a service related to or 
an instrumentality used in the transportation or service. The Board may 
prescribe the maximum reasonable charge or allowance a rail carrier 
subject to its jurisdiction may pay for a service or instrumentality 
furnished under this section. The Board may begin a proceeding under 
this section on its own initiative or on application.

``Sec. 10746. Demurrage charges

    ``A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall compute demurrage 
charges, and establish rules related to those charges, in a way that

    ``(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for 
transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, 
the person may direct the rail carrier to transport the property over an 
established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part 
of the route, the person shipping the property may designate the lines 
over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in 
writing. A rail carrier may be directed to transport property over a 
particular through route when--

        property could be transported;

carrier, that rail carrier must also receive and transport it according 
to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding rail

    ``(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall provide the 
transportation or service on reasonable request. A rail carrier shall 
not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its 
reasonable commitments under contracts authorized under section 10709 of 
this title before responding to reasonable requests for service. 
Commitments which deprive a carrier of its ability to respond to 
reasonable requests for common carrier service are not reasonable.
    ``(b) A rail carrier shall also provide to any person, on request, 
the carrier's rates and other service terms. The response by a rail 
carrier to a request for the carrier's rates and other service terms 
shall be--
            ``(1) in writing and forwarded to the requesting person 
        promptly after receipt of the request; or
            ``(2) promptly made available in electronic form.

change any common carrier service terms unless 20 days have expired 
after written or electronic notice is provided to any person who, within 
the previous 12 months--

transportation of agricultural products, in addition to the requirements 
of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a rail carrier shall publish, make 
available, and retain for public inspection its common carrier rates, 
schedules of rates, and other service terms, and any proposed and actual 
changes to such rates and service terms. For purposes of this 
subsection, agricultural products shall include grain as defined in 
section 3 of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 75) and all 
products thereof, and fertilizer.

accordance with the rates and service terms, and any changes thereto, as 
published or otherwise made available under subsection (b), (c), or (d).

carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Board under this part, to be used by another rail carrier if the Board 
finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without 
substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the 
facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. 
The rail carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and 
compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the rail carriers 
cannot agree, the Board may establish conditions and compensation for 
use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in 
condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately 
secured before a rail carrier may begin to use the facilities of another 
rail carrier under this section.
    ``(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be 
used by another rail carrier under this section is entitled to recover 
damages from the other rail carrier for injuries sustained as the result 
of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or 
both as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the 
conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the 
compensation is not paid promptly.
    ``(c)(1) The Board may require rail carriers to enter into 
reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be 
practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are 
necessary to provide competitive rail service. The rail carriers 
entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and 
compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the rail carriers 
cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable 
period of time, the Board may establish such conditions and 
compensation.

into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions 
for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.

operate, on reasonable conditions, a switch connection to connect that 
branch line or private side track with its railroad and shall furnish 
cars to move that traffic to the best of its ability without 
discrimination in favor of or against the shipper when the connection--

control or franchises acquired through the transaction without the 
approval of a State authority. A rail carrier, corporation, or person

the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal 
law, as necessary to let that rail carrier, corporation, or person carry 
out the transaction, hold, maintain, and operate property, and exercise 
control or franchises acquired through the transaction. However, if a 
purchase and sale, a lease, or a corporate consolidation or merger is 
involved in the transaction, the carrier or corporation may carry out 
the transaction only with the assent of a majority, or the number 
required under applicable State law, of the votes of the holders of the 
capital stock of that corporation entitled to vote. The vote must occur 
at a regular meeting, or special meeting called for that purpose, of 
those stockholders and the notice of the meeting must indicate its 
purpose.

another of those rail carriers to pool or divide traffic or services or 
any part of their earnings without the approval of the Board under this

authorize the agreement or combination if the rail carriers involved 
assent to the pooling or division and the Board finds that a pooling or 
division of traffic, services, or earnings--

        public or of economy of operation; and

how that result is reached, only with the approval and authorization of

        those affiliated rail carriers, taken together, in control of 
        another rail carrier.

rail carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be 
managed in the interest of the other rail carrier.

the person seeking that authority. <<NOTE: Notification.>> When an 
application is filed with the Board, the Board shall notify the chief 
executive officer of each State in which property of the rail carriers

        or in the national rail system.

section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public 
interest. The Board may impose conditions governing the transaction, 
including the divestiture of parallel tracks or requiring the granting 
of trackage rights and access to other facilities. Any trackage rights 
and related conditions imposed to alleviate anticompetitive effects of 
the transaction shall provide for operating terms and compensation 
levels to ensure that such effects are alleviated. When the transaction 
contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of 
fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the 
Board may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that 
the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public 
interest. The Board may require inclusion of other rail carriers located 
in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and 
the Board finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public 
interest.

merger or control of at least two Class I railroads, as defined by the

        substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly, or 
        restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in any 
        region of the United States; and

application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 
333(a)-(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any

        to a commercial or industrial use and subject to a property tax 
        levy.

    ``(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate 
against interstate commerce, and a State, subdivision of a State, or 
authority acting for a State or subdivision of a State may not do any of 
them:
            ``(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value that 
        has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail 
        transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value 
        of other commercial and industrial property in the same

this subsection only if the ratio of assessed value to true market value 
of rail transportation property exceeds by at least 5 percent the ratio 
of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and 
industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction. The burden
of proof in determining assessed value and true market value is governed 
by State law. If the ratio of the assessed value of other commercial and 
industrial property in the assessment jurisdiction to the true market 
value of all other commercial and industrial property cannot be 
determined to the satisfaction of the district court through the random-
sampling method known as a sales assessment ratio study (to be carried 
out under statistical principles applicable to such a study), the court

Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the 
liability of a rail carrier. A delivering rail carrier is deemed to be 
the rail carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the 
destination but does not include a rail carrier providing only a 
switching service at the destination.

amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced 
by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses 
reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.

imposed under subsection (a) of this section except as provided in this 
subsection. A limitation of liability or of the amount of recovery or 
representation or agreement in a receipt, bill of lading, contract, or 
rule in violation of this section is void.

otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it 
under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a 
civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a 
civil action is computed from the date the carrier gives a person 
written notice that the carrier has disallowed any part of the claim 
specified in the notice. For the purposes of this subsection--
            ``(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a 
        disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier, in

        of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of 
        household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of 
        chapter 135 may establish a rate for the transportation of

            ``(2) Nonpreferential; nonpredatory.--Any rate established 
        under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential

            ``(1) Authority.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) 
        of this subsection, a motor carrier providing transportation of 
        household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of

        contract for such services and provide a penalty or per diem 
        payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver

signor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined 
under this section when the transportation is provided by motor carrier 
under this part. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier 
transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent 
only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is 
liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee 
is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to 
be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the 
delivering carrier before delivery of the property--
            ``(1) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and
            ``(2) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the 
        property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than 
        the place specified in the original bill of lading.

only for rates billed at the time of delivery under subsection (a), the 
shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, 
the beneficial owner is liable for those additional rates regardless of 
the bill of the lading or contract under which the property was 
transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the 
property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or 
abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in 
the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and 
address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier 
erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the 
property is liable for the additional rates.

``Sec. 13707. Payment of rates

    ``(a) Transfer of Possession Upon Payment.--Except as provided in 
subsection (b), a carrier providing transportation or service subject to 
jurisdiction under this part shall give up possession at the destination 
of the property transported by it only when payment for the 
transportation or service is made.
    ``(b) Exceptions.--
            ``(1) Regulations.--Under regulations of the Secretary 
        governing the payment for transportation and service and 
        preventing discrimination, those carriers may give up possession 
        at destination of property transported by them before payment 
        for the transportation or service. The regulations of the 
        Secretary may provide for weekly or monthly payment for 
        transportation provided by motor carriers and for periodic 
        payment for transportation provided by water carriers.
            ``(2) Extensions of credit to governmental entities.--Such a 
        carrier (including a motor carrier being used by a household 
        goods freight forwarder) may extend credit for transporting 
        property for the United States Government, a State, a territory 
        or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision

directly to the motor carrier for payment or agent of such responsible 
person, the actual rates, charges, or allowances for any transportation 
service and shall also disclose, at such time,

    ``(b) False or Misleading Information.--No person may cause a motor 
carrier to present false or misleading information on a document about 
the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction.
    ``(c) Allowances for Services.--When the actual rate, charge, or 
allowance is dependent upon the performance of a service by a party to 
the transportation arrangement, such as tendering a volume of freight 
over a stated period of time, the motor carrier shall indicate in any 
document presented for payment to the person responsible directly to the 
motor carrier that a reduction, allowance, or other adjustment may 
apply.

        register a motor carrier under section 13902 only if the 
        registrant files with the Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or 
        other type of security approved by the Secretary, in an amount 
        not less than such amount as the Secretary prescribes pursuant 
        to, or as is required by, sections 31138 and 31139, and the laws 
        of the State or States in which the registrant is operating, to 
        the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, 
        not more than the amount of the security, for each final 
        judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to, or death 
        of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, 
        maintenance, or use of motor vehicles, or for loss or damage to 
        property (except property referred to in paragraph (3) of this 
        subsection), or both. A registration remains in effect only as

[[Page 109 STAT. 886]]

        to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection. This paragraph 
        only applies to a foreign motor private carrier and foreign 
        motor carrier operating in the United States to the extent that 
        such carrier is providing transportation between places in a 
        foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a 
        place in another foreign country.

        property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of 
        the motor carrier as the result of transportation provided under 
        this part. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or 
        consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting 
        motor carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the 
        amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any 
        such security.

    ``(b) Broker Requirements.--The Secretary may register a person as a 
broker under section 13904 only if the person files with the Secretary a 
bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the

        security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of 
        the security, for each final judgment against the freight 
        forwarder for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual, or 
        loss of, or damage to, property (other than property referred to 
        in paragraph (2) of this subsection), resulting from the 
        negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles by or 
        under the direction and control of the freight forwarder when 
        providing transfer, collection, or delivery service under this 
        part.

        require a registered freight forwarder to file with the 
        Secretary a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security 
        approved by the Secretary sufficient to pay, not more than the 
        amount of the security, for loss of, or damage to, property for 
        which the freight forwarder provides service.
            ``(3) Effective period.--The freight forwarder's 
        registration remains in effect only as long as the freight 
        forwarder continues to satisfy the security requirements of this

amount of security filed under this section. A motor carrier may submit 
proof of qualifications as a self-insurer to satisfy the security

which have been granted authority to self-insure as of the effective 
date of this section shall retain that authority unless, for good cause 
shown and after notice
and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds that the authority 
must be revoked.

    ``(e) Notice of Cancellation of Insurance. <<NOTE: Regulations.>> --
The Secretary shall issue regulations requiring the submission to the 
Secretary of notices of insurance cancellation sufficiently in advance 
of actual cancellation so as to enable the Secretary to promptly revoke 
the registration of any carrier or broker after the effective date of 
the cancellation.

appropriate form of endorsement to be appended to policies of insurance 
and surety bonds which will subject the insurance policy or surety bond 
to the full security limits of the coverage required under this section.

        providing household goods transportation services (including 
        accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a 
        motor carrier providing transportation of household goods has 
        violated section 14901(e) or 14912 or is consistently not fit, 
        willing, and able to provide adequate household goods 
        transportation services (including accessorial and terminal 
        services), the Secretary may issue to such agent a complaint 
        stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place 
        of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after 
        service of the complaint to such agent.

        to provide adequate household goods transportation services 
        (including accessorial and terminal services), the Secretary may 
        issue an order to compel compliance with the requirement that 
        the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Secretary 
        may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent 
        from any involvement in the transportation or provision of 
        services incidental to the transportation of household goods if, 
        after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary 
        finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date 
        of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in

[[Page 109 STAT. 888]]

        no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has

        by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to 
        the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and 
        after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be 
        heard. At such hearing, a determination shall be made whether 
        the order issued pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection 
        should be rescinded.

            ``(2) Transportation.--The term `transportation' means 
        transportation that would be subject to the jurisdiction of the

``Sec. 13908. Registration and other reforms

    ``(a) Regulations Replacing Certain Programs.--The Secretary, in 
cooperation with the States, and after notice and opportunity for public 
comment, shall issue regulations to replace the current Department of 
Transportation identification number system, the single State 
registration system under section 14504, the registration system 
contained in this chapter, and the financial responsibility information 
system under section 13906 with a single, on-line, Federal system. The 
new system shall serve as a clearing

house and depository of information on and identification of all foreign 
and domestic motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders, and others 
required to register with the Department as well as information on 
safety fitness and compliance with required levels of financial 
responsibility. In issuing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider 
whether or not to integrate the requirements of section 13304 into the 
new system and may integrate such requirements into the new system.
    ``(b) Factors To Be Considered.--In conducting the rulemaking under 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall, at a minimum, consider the 
following factors:
            ``(1) Funding for State enforcement of motor carrier safety 
        regulations.
            ``(2) Whether the existing single State registration system 
        is duplicative and burdensome.

        registration system to motor private carriers and to carriers 
        exempt under sections 13502, 13503, and 13506.

    ``(c) Fee System.--The Secretary may establish, under section 9701 
of title 31, a fee system for registration and filing evidence of 
financial responsibility under the new system under subsection (a). Fees 
collected under the fee system shall cover the costs of operating and 
upgrading the registration system, including all personnel costs 
associated with the system. Fees collected under this subsection may be 
credited to the Department of Transportation appropriations account for 
purposes for which such fees are collected, and shall be available for 
expenditure until expended.

    ``(d) State Registration Programs.--If the Secretary determines that 
no State should require insurance filings or collect fees for such 
filings (including filings and fees authorized under section 14504), the 
Secretary may prevent any State or political subdivision thereof, or any 
political authority of 2 or more States, from imposing any insurance 
filing requirements or fees that are for the same purposes as filings or 
fees the Secretary requires under the new system under subsection (a). 
The Secretary may not take any action pursuant to this subsection 
unless--
            ``(1) fees that will be collected by the Secretary under 
        subsection (c) and distributed in each fiscal year to the States 
        will provide each State with at least as much revenue as that

carriers from backweighing shipments or from basing their charges on the 
reweigh weights if the shipper observes both the tare and gross 
weighings (or, prior to such weighings, waives in writing the

        competition.--Prior to the effective date of the agreement or

        combination is of major transportation importance and whether 
        there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or 
        combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Board 
        determines that neither of these 2 factors exists, it shall, 
        prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and 
        authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and 
        regulations as the Board may issue, and for such consideration

        will be in the interest of better service to
the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly 
restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or 
combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such 
hearing, the Board shall indicate to what extent it finds that the 
agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to 
the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain 
competition and if assented to by all the carriers involved, shall to 
that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under 
such rules and regulations as the Board may issue, and for such 
consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions

        household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or

        combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better 
        service to the public and of economy in operation and not to 
        restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be 
        carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as 
        or similar to practices carried out under agreements and 
        combinations between motor carriers providing transportation of 
        household goods to pool or divide traffic or service of any part 
        of their earnings approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission

subchapter I of chapter 135 and providing transportation in that State, 
must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on 
transportation referred to in section 13501 when the State registration 
is completed under standards of the Secretary under subsection (c). When 
a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the 
standards of the Secretary, the part in excess is an unreasonable

                    ``(A) In general.--When the Board or Secretary, as 
                applicable, makes an award under subsection (b) of this 
                section, the Board or Secretary, as applicable, shall 
                order the carrier to pay the amount awarded by a 
                specific date. The Board or Secretary, as applicable, 
                may order a carrier or broker providing transportation 
                or service subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 to 
                pay damages only when the proceeding is on complaint.
                    ``(B) Enforcement by civil action.--The person for 
                whose benefit an order of the Board or Secretary 
                requiring the payment of money is made may bring a civil 
                action to enforce that order under this paragraph if the 
                carrier or broker does not pay the amount awarded by the 
                date payment was ordered to be made.

    ``(d) Procedure.--
            ``(1) In general.--When a person begins a civil action under 
        subsection (b) of this section to enforce an order of the Board 
        or Secretary requiring the payment of damages by a carrier or 
        broker providing transportation or service subject to 
        jurisdiction under chapter 135 of this title, the text of the 
        order of the Board or Secretary must be included in the 
        complaint. In addition to the district courts of the United 
        States, a State court of general jurisdiction having 
        jurisdiction of the parties has jurisdiction to enforce an order 
        under this paragraph. The findings and order of the Board or 
        Secretary are competent evidence of the facts stated in them. 
        Trial in a civil action brought in a district court of the 
        United States under this paragraph is in the judicial district 
        in which the plaintiff resides or in which the principal 
        operating office of the carrier or broker is located. In a civil 
        action under this paragraph, the plaintiff is liable for only 
        those costs that accrue on an appeal taken by the plaintiff.
            ``(2) Parties.--All parties in whose favor the award was 
        made may be joined as plaintiffs in a civil action brought in a 
        district court of the United States under this subsection and 
        all the carriers that are parties to the order awarding damages 
        may be joined as defendants. Trial in the action is in the 
        judicial district in which any one of the plaintiffs could bring 
        the action against any one of the defendants. Process may be 
        served on a defendant at its principal operating office when 
        that defendant is not in the district in which the action

[[Page 109 STAT. 907]]

        is brought. A judgment ordering recovery may be made in favor of 
        any of those plaintiffs against the defendant found to be liable 
        to that plaintiff.

    ``(e) Attorney's Fees. <<NOTE: Courts.>> --The district court shall 
award a reasonable attorney's fee under this section. The district court 
shall tax and collect that fee as part of the costs of the action.

``Sec. 14705. Limitation on actions by and against 
                        carriers <<NOTE: Claims.>> 

    ``(a) In General.--A carrier providing transportation or service 
subject to jurisdiction under chapter 135 must begin a civil action to 
recover charges for transportation or service provided by the carrier 
within 18 months after the claim accrues.
    ``(b) Overcharges.--A person must begin a civil action to recover 
overcharges within 18 months after the claim accrues. If the claim is 
against a carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under 
chapter 135 and an election to file a complaint with the Board or 
Secretary, as applicable, is made under section 14704(c)(1), the 
complaint must be filed within 3 years after the claim accrues.
    ``(c) Damages.--A person must file a complaint with the Board or 
Secretary, as applicable, to recover damages under section 14704(b) 
within 2 years after the claim accrues.

    ``(d) Extensions.--The limitation periods under subsection (b) of 
this section are extended for 6 months from the time written notice is 
given to the claimant by the carrier of disallowance of any part of the 
claim specified in the notice if a written claim is given to the carrier 
within those limitation periods. The limitation periods under 
subsections (b) and (c) of this section are extended for 90 days from 
the time the carrier begins a civil action under subsection (a) to 
recover charges related to the same transportation or service, or 
collects (without beginning a civil action under that subsection) the 
charge for that transportation or service if that action is begun or 
collection is made within the appropriate period.
    ``(e) Payment.--A person must begin a civil action to enforce an 
order of the Board or Secretary against a carrier within 1 year after 
the date of the order.
    ``(f) Government Transportation.--This section applies to 
transportation for the United States Government. The time limitations 
under this section are extended, as related to transportation for or on 
behalf of the United States Government, for 3 years from the later of 
the date of--
            ``(1) payment of the rate for the transportation or service 
        involved;
            ``(2) subsequent refund for overpayment of that rate; or
            ``(3) deduction made under section 3726 of title 31.

    ``(g) Accrual Date.--A claim related to a shipment of property 
accrues under this section on delivery or tender of delivery by the 
carrier.

``Sec. 14706. Liability of carriers under receipts and bills of lading

    ``(a) General Liability.--
            ``(1) Motor carriers and freight forwarders.--A carrier 
        providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction 
        under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 shall issue a receipt 
        or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation 
        under this part. That carrier and any other carrier that 
        delivers

[[Page 109 STAT. 908]]

        the property and is providing transportation or service subject 
        to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 or 
        chapter 105 are liable to the person entitled to recover under 
        the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this 
        paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property 
        caused by (A) the receiving carrier, (B) the delivering carrier, 
        or (C) another carrier over whose line or route the property is 
        transported in the United States or from a place in the United 
        States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when 
        transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the 
        case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or 
        diverted under a tariff under section 13702. Failure to issue a 
        receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a 
        carrier. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier 
        performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination 
        but does not include a carrier providing only a switching 
        service at the destination.
            ``(2) Freight forwarder.--A freight forwarder is both the 
        receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder 
        provides service and uses a motor carrier providing 
        transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of 
        chapter 135 to receive property from a consignor, the motor 
        carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for 
        the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the 
        freight forwarder, a motor carrier may deliver property for a 
        freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, 
        freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, 
        and receipt for the property may be made on the freight 
        forwarder's delivery receipt.

    ``(b) Apportionment.--The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of 
lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property 
for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to 
recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury 
occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, 
as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the
amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action 
brought by that person.

    ``(c) Special Rules.--
            ``(1) Motor carriers.--
                    ``(A) Shipper waiver.--Subject to the provisions of 
                subparagraph (B), a carrier providing transportation or 
                service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or 
                III of chapter 135 may, subject to the provisions of 
                this chapter (including with respect to a motor carrier, 
                the requirements of section 13710(a)), establish rates 
                for the transportation of property (other than household 
                goods described in section 13102(10)(A)) under which the 
                liability of the carrier for such property is limited to 
                a value established by written or electronic declaration 
                of the shipper or by written agreement between the 
                carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable 
                under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
                    ``(B) Carrier notification.--If the motor carrier is 
                not required to file its tariff with the Board, it shall 
                provide under section 13710(a)(1) to the shipper, on 
                request of the shipper, a written or electronic copy of 
                the rate, classification, rules, and practices upon 
                which any rate applicable

[[Page 109 STAT. 909]]

                to a shipment, or agreed to between the shipper and the 
                carrier, is based. The copy provided by the carrier 
                shall clearly state the dates of applicability of the 
                rate, classification, rules, or practices.
                    ``(C) Prohibition against collective 
                establishment.--No discussion, consideration, or 
                approval as to rules to limit liability under this 
                subsection may be undertaken by carriers acting under an 
                agreement approved pursuant to section 13703.
            ``(2) Water carriers.--If loss or injury to property occurs 
        while it is in the custody of a water carrier, the liability of 
        that carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law 
        applicable to water transportation. The liability of the initial 
        or delivering carrier is the same as the liability of the water 
        carrier.

    ``(d) Civil Actions.--
            ``(1) Against delivering carrier.--A civil action under this 
        section may be brought against a delivering carrier in a 
        district court of the United States or in a State court. Trial, 
        if the action is brought in a district court of the United 
        States is in a judicial district, and if in a State court, is in 
        a State through which the defendant carrier operates.
            ``(2) Against carrier responsible for loss.--A civil action 
        under this section may be brought against the carrier alleged to 
        have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in 
        which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.
            ``(3) Jurisdiction of courts.--A civil action under this 
        section may be brought in a United States district court or in a 
        State court.
            ``(4) Judicial district defined.--In this section, `judicial 
        district' means--
                    ``(A) in the case of a United States district court, 
                a judicial district of the United States; and
                    ``(B) in the case of a State court, the applicable 
                geographic area over which such court exercises 
                jurisdiction.

    ``(e) Minimum Period for Filing Claims.--
            ``(1) In general.--A carrier may not provide by rule, 
        contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for 
        filing a claim against it under this section and a period of 
        less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under 
        this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed 
        from the date the carrier gives a person written notice that the 
        carrier has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the 
        notice.
            ``(2) Special rules.--For the purposes of this subsection--
                    ``(A) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a 
                disallowance of any part of the claim unless the 
                carrier, in writing, informs the claimant that such part 
                of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such 
                disallowance; and
                    ``(B) communications received from a carrier's 
                insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part 
                of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the 
                claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, 
                provides reason for

[[Page 109 STAT. 910]]

                such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the 
                insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier.

    ``(f) Limiting Liability of Household Goods Carriers to Declared 
Value.--A carrier or group of carriers subject to jurisdiction under 
subchapter I or III of chapter 135 may petition the Board to modify, 
eliminate, or establish rates for the transportation of household goods 
under which the liability of the carrier for that property is limited to 
a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a 
written agreement.

    ``(g) Modifications and Reforms.--
            ``(1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to 
        determine whether any modifications or reforms should be made to 
        the loss and damage provisions of this section, including those 
        related to limitation of liability by carriers.
            ``(2) Factors to consider.--In conducting the study, the 
        Secretary, at a minimum, shall consider--
                    ``(A) the efficient delivery of transportation 
                services;
                    ``(B) international and intermodal harmony;
                    ``(C) the public interest; and
                    ``(D) the interest of carriers and shippers.
            ``(3) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the effective 
        date of this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 
        report on the results of the study, together with any 
        recommendations of the Secretary (including legislative 
        recommendations) for implementing modifications or reforms 
        identified by the Secretary as being appropriate.

``Sec. 14707. Private enforcement of registration requirement

    ``(a) In General.--If a person provides transportation by motor 
vehicle or service in clear violation of section 13901-13904 or 13906, a 
person injured by the transportation or service may bring a civil action 
to enforce any such section. In a civil action under this subsection, 
trial is in the judicial district in which the person who violated that 
section operates.
    ``(b) Procedure.--A copy of the complaint in a civil action under 
subsection (a) shall be served on the Secretary and a certificate of 
service must appear in the complaint filed with the court. The Secretary 
may intervene in a civil action under subsection (a). The Secretary may 
notify the district court in which the action is pending that the 
Secretary intends to consider the matter that is the subject of the 
complaint in a proceeding before the Secretary. When that notice is 
filed, the court shall stay further action pending disposition of the 
proceeding before the Secretary.
    ``(c) Attorney's Fees.--In a civil action under subsection (a), the 
court may determine the amount of and award a reasonable attorney's fee 
to the prevailing party. That fee is in addition to costs allowable 
under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

``Sec. 14708. Dispute settlement program for household goods carriers

    ``(a) Offering Shippers Arbitration.--As a condition of registration 
under section 13902 or 13903, a carrier providing transportation of 
household goods subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of 
chapter 135 must agree to offer in accordance with this section to 
shippers of household goods arbitration as a means of settling disputes 
between such carriers and shippers of household goods concerning damage 
or loss to the household goods transported.

[[Page 109 STAT. 911]]

    ``(b) Arbitration Requirements.--
            ``(1) Prevention of special advantage.--The arbitration that 
        is offered must be designed to prevent a carrier from having any 
        special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or 
        does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or 
        other place of business.
            ``(2) Notice of arbitration procedure.--The carrier must 
        provide the shipper an adequate notice of the availability of 
        neutral arbitration, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate 
        summary of the arbitration procedure, any applicable costs, and 
        disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize 
        arbitration. Such notice must be given to persons for whom 
        household goods are to be transported by the carrier before such 
        goods are tendered to the carrier for transportation.
            ``(3) Provision of forms.--Upon request of a shipper, the 
        carrier must promptly provide such forms and other information 
        as are necessary for initiating an action to resolve a dispute 
        under arbitration.
            ``(4) Independence of arbitrator.--Each person authorized to 
        arbitrate or otherwise settle disputes must be independent of 
        the parties to the dispute and must be capable, as determined 
        under such regulations as the Secretary may issue, to resolve 
        such disputes fairly and expeditiously. The carrier must ensure 
        that each person chosen to settle the disputes is authorized and 
        able to obtain from the shipper or carrier any material and 
        relevant information to the extent necessary to carry out a fair 
        and expeditious decisionmaking process.
            ``(5) Apportionment of costs.--No shipper may be charged 
        more than half of the cost for instituting an arbitration 
        proceeding that is brought under this section. In the decision, 
        the arbitrator may determine which party shall pay the cost or a 
        portion of the cost of the arbitration proceeding, including the 
        cost of instituting the proceeding.
            ``(6) Requests.--The carrier must not require the shipper to 
        agree to utilize arbitration prior to the time that a dispute 
        arises. If the dispute involves a claim for $1,000 or less and 
        the shipper requests arbitration, such arbitration shall be 
        binding on the parties. If the dispute involves a claim for more 
        than $1,000 and the shipper requests arbitration, such 
        arbitration shall be binding on the parties only if the carrier 
        agrees to arbitration.
            ``(7) Oral presentation of evidence.--The arbitrator may 
        provide for an oral presentation of a dispute concerning 
        transportation of household goods by a party to the dispute (or 
        a party's representative), but such oral presentation may be 
        made only if all parties to the dispute expressly agree to such 
        presentation and the date, time, and location of such 
        presentation.
            ``(8) Deadline for decision.--The arbitrator must, as 
        expeditiously as possible but at least within 60 days of receipt 
        of written notification of the dispute, render a decision based 
        on the information gathered; except that, in any case in which a 
        party to the dispute fails to provide in a timely manner any 
        information concerning such dispute which the person settling 
        the dispute may reasonably require to resolve the dispute, the 
        arbitrator may extend such 60-day period for a reasonable period 
        of time. A decision resolving a dispute may include

[[Page 109 STAT. 912]]

        any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including 
        repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, and 
        compensation for damages.

    ``(c) Limitation on Use of Materials.--Materials and information 
obtained in the course of a decision making process to settle a dispute 
by arbitration under this section may not be used to bring an action 
under section 14905.
    ``(d) Attorney's Fees to Shippers.--In any court action to resolve a 
dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing 
transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or 
III of chapter 135 concerning the transportation of household goods by 
such carrier, the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees 
if--
            ``(1) the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within 120 
        days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the 
        delivery is scheduled, whichever is later;

        through arbitration under this section and is instituted after

dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing 
transportation, or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or 
III of chapter 135 concerning the transportation of household goods by 
such carrier, such carrier may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees by 
the court only if the shipper brought such action in bad faith--

        under this section; or

                for resolution of such dispute (including, if 
                applicable, an extension of such period under such 
                subsection) ends; and
                    ``(B) a decision resolving such dispute is rendered.

    ``(f) Limitation of Applicability to Collect-on-Delivery 
Transportation.--The provisions of this section shall apply only in the 
case of collect-on-delivery transportation of household goods.

effective date of this section, the Secretary shall complete a review of 
the dispute settlement program established under this 
section. <<NOTE: Reports.>>  If, after notice and opportunity for 
comment, the Secretary determines that changes are necessary to such 
program to ensure the fair and equitable resolution of disputes under 
this section, the Secretary shall implement such changes and transmit a 
report to Congress on such changes.

``Sec. 15906. Liability of pipeline carriers under receipts and bills of 
                        lading

    ``(a) General Liability.--A pipeline carrier providing 
transportation or service subject to this part shall issue a receipt or 
bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this 
part. That carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and 
is providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under 
this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt 
or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for 
the actual loss or injury to the property caused by the carrier over 
whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or 
from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign 
country when transported under a through bill of lading. Failure to 
issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a 
carrier.

    ``(b) Apportionment.--The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of 
lading under subsection (a) or delivering the property for which the 
receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the 
carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount 
required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a 
receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses 
reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.
    ``(c) Civil Actions.--A civil action under this section may be 
brought against a delivering carrier in a district court of the United 
States or in a State court. Trial, if the action is brought in a 
district court of the United States is in a judicial district, and if in 
a State court, is in a State, through which the defendant carrier 
operates a line or route.
    ``(d) Minimum Period for Filing Claims.--A pipeline carrier may not 
provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months 
for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less 
than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. 
The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the 
carrier gives a person written notice that the carrier has disallowed 
any part of the claim specified in the notice. For the purposes of this 
subsection--
            ``(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a 
        disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier, in 
        writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is 
        disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and
            ``(2) communications received from a carrier's insurer shall 
        not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless 
        the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of 
        the claim is disallowed, provides reasons for such disallowance, 
        and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of 
        the carrier.

why private funding would create any such conflict or appearance, or is 
otherwise impractical.

deliberations of the Council.

                    (B) to determine whether a packaging standard 
                (including such fiber drum industry standards), other 
                than such performance-oriented packaging standards, will 
                provide an equal or greater level of safety for the 
                transportation of

[[Page 109 STAT. 958]]

                liquid hazardous materials than would be provided if 
                such performance-oriented packaging standards were in 
                effect.
            (2) Completion.--The study shall be completed before March 
        1, 1997 and shall be transmitted to the Committee on Commerce, 
        Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Transportation 
        and Infrastructure Committee of the House of Representatives.

    (d) <<NOTE: Regulations.>>  Secretarial Action.--By September 30, 
1997, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to determine what

            (5) the impact on domestic cargo pricing of foreign cargo 
        services;
            (6) whether additional protections are needed to protect 
        shippers from the abuse of market power; and
            (7) the extent to which statutory or regulatory changes 
        should be made to further the transportation policy of section
