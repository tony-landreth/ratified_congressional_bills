                  emergency salvage timber sale program

    Sec. 2001. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1611 note.>>  (a) Definitions.--For 
purposes of this section:
            (1) The term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means 
        the Committee on Resources, the Committee on Agriculture, and 
        the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
        and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Committee 
        on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate.

[[Page 109 STAT. 241]]

            (2) The term ``emergency period'' means the period beginning 
        on the date of the enactment of this section and ending on 
        September 30, 1997.
            (3) The term ``salvage timber sale'' means a timber sale for 
        which an important reason for entry includes the removal of 
        disease- or insect-infested trees, dead, damaged, or down trees, 
        or trees affected by fire or imminently susceptible to fire or 
        insect attack. Such term also includes the removal of associated 
        trees or trees lacking the characteristics of a healthy and 
        viable ecosystem for the purpose of ecosystem improvement or 
        rehabilitation, except that any such sale must include an 
        identifiable salvage component of trees described in the first 
        sentence.
            (4) The term ``Secretary concerned'' means--
                    (A) the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to 
                lands within the National Forest System; and
                    (B) the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to 
                Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of 
                Land Management.

    (b) Completion of Salvage Timber Sales.--
            (1) Salvage timber sales.-- <<NOTE: Contracts.>> Using the 
        expedited procedures provided in subsection (c), the Secretary 
        concerned shall prepare, advertise, offer, and award contracts 
        during the emergency period for salvage timber sales from 
        Federal lands described in subsection (a)(4). During the 
        emergency period, the Secretary concerned is to achieve, to the 
        maximum extent feasible, a salvage timber sale volume level 
        above the programmed level to reduce the backlogged volume of 
        salvage timber. The preparation, advertisement, offering, and 
        awarding of such contracts shall be performed utilizing 
        subsection (c) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
        including a law under the authority of which any judicial order 
        may be outstanding on or after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
            (2) Use of salvage sale funds.--To conduct salvage timber 
        sales under this subsection, the Secretary concerned may use 
        salvage sale funds otherwise available to the Secretary 
        concerned.
            (3) Sales in preparation.--Any salvage timber sale in 
        preparation on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be 
        subject to the provisions of this section.

    (c) Expedited Procedures for Emergency Salvage Timber Sales.--
            (1) Sale documentation.--
                    (A) Preparation.--For each salvage timber sale 
                conducted under subsection (b), the Secretary concerned 
                shall prepare a document that combines an environmental 
                assessment
under section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(42 U.S.C. 4332(2)) (including regulations implementing such section) 
and a biological evaluation under section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)) and other applicable Federal 
law and implementing regulations. A document embodying decisions 
relating to salvage timber sales proposed under authority of this 
section shall, at the sole discretion of the Secretary concerned and to 
the extent the Secretary concerned considers appropriate and feasible, 
consider the environmental effects of the salvage timber

[[Page 109 STAT. 242]]

sale and the effect, if any, on threatened or endangered species, and to 
the extent the Secretary concerned, at his sole discretion, considers 
appropriate and feasible, be consistent with any standards and 
guidelines from the management plans applicable to the National Forest 
or Bureau of Land Management District on which the salvage timber sale 
occurs.
                    (B) Use of existing materials.--In lieu of preparing 
                a new document under this paragraph, the Secretary 
                concerned may use a document prepared pursuant to the 
                National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
                4321 et seq.) before the date of the enactment of this 
                Act, a biological evaluation written before such date, 
                or information collected for such a document or 
                evaluation if the document, evaluation, or information 
                applies to the Federal lands covered by the proposed 
                sale.
                    (C) Scope and content.--The scope and content of the 
                documentation and information prepared, considered, and 
                relied on under this paragraph is at the sole discretion 
                of the Secretary concerned.
            (2) Reporting requirements.--Not later than August 30, 1995, 
        the Secretary concerned shall submit a report to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress on the implementation of this section.

        committees of Congress every six months thereafter until the 
        completion of all salvage timber sales conducted under 
        subsection (b). Each report shall contain the following:
                    (A) The volume of salvage timber sales sold and 
                harvested, as of the date of the report, for each 
                National Forest and each district of the Bureau of Land 
                Management.
                    (B) The available salvage volume contained in each 
                National Forest and each district of the Bureau of Land 
                Management.
                    (C) A plan and schedule for an enhanced salvage 
                timber sale program for fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 
                1997 using the authority provided by this section for 
                salvage timber sales.
                    (D) A description of any needed resources and 
                personnel, including personnel reassignments, required 
                to conduct an enhanced salvage timber sale program 
                through fiscal year 1997.
                    (E) A statement of the intentions of the Secretary 
                concerned with respect to the salvage timber sale volume 
                levels specified in the joint explanatory statement of 
                managers accompanying the conference report on H.R. 
                1158, House Report 104-124.
            (3) Advancement of sales authorized.--The Secretary 
        concerned may begin salvage timber sales under subsection (b) 
        intended for a subsequent fiscal year before the start of such 
        fiscal year if the Secretary concerned determines that 
        performance of
such salvage timber sales will not interfere with salvage timber sales 
intended for a preceding fiscal year.
            (4) Decisions.--The Secretary concerned shall design and 
        select the specific salvage timber sales to be offered under 
        subsection (b) on the basis of the analysis contained in the 
        document or documents prepared pursuant to paragraph (1)

[[Page 109 STAT. 243]]

        to achieve, to the maximum extent feasible, a salvage timber 
        sale volume level above the program level.
            (5) Sale preparation.--
                    (A) Use of available authorities.--The Secretary 
                concerned shall make use of all available authority, 
                including the employment of private contractors and the 
                use of expedited fire contracting procedures, to prepare 
                and advertise salvage timber sales under subsection (b).
                    (B) Exemptions.--The preparation, solicitation, and

                be exempt from--
                          (i) the requirements of the Competition in 
                      Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253 et seq.) and the 
                      implementing regulations in the Federal 
                      Acquisition Regulation issued pursuant to section 
                      25(c) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
                      Act (41 U.S.C. 421(c)) and any departmental 
                      acquisition regulations; and
                          (ii) the notice and publication requirements 
                      in section 18 of such Act (41 U.S.C. 416) and 8(e) 
                      of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and 
                      the implementing regulations in the Federal 
                      Acquisition Regulations and any departmental 
                      acquisition regulations.
                    (C) Incentive payment recipients; report.--The 
                provisions of section 3(d)(1) of the Federal Workforce 
                Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-226; 5 U.S.C. 
                5597 note) shall not apply to any former employee of the 
                Secretary concerned who received a voluntary separation 
                incentive payment authorized by such Act and accepts 
                employment pursuant to this paragraph. The Director of 
                the Office of Personnel Management and the Secretary 
                concerned shall provide a summary report to the 
                appropriate committees of Congress, the Committee on 
                Government Reform and Oversight of the House of 
                Representatives, and the Committee on Governmental 
                Affairs of the Senate regarding the number of incentive 
                payment recipients who were rehired, their terms of 
                reemployment, their job classifications, and an 
                explanation, in the judgment of the agencies involved of 
                how such reemployment without repayment of the incentive 
                payments received is consistent with the original waiver 
                provisions of such Act. This report shall not be 
                conducted in a manner that would delay the rehiring of 
                any former employees under this paragraph, or affect the 
                normal confidentiality of Federal employees.
            (6) Cost considerations.--Salvage timber sales undertaken 
        pursuant to this section shall not be precluded because the 
        costs of such activities are likely to exceed the revenues 
        derived from such activities.
            (7) Effect of salvage sales.--The Secretary concerned shall 
        not substitute salvage timber sales conducted under subsection 
        (b) for planned non-salvage timber sales.
            (8) Reforestation of salvage timber sale parcels.--The 
        Secretary concerned shall plan and implement reforestation of 
        each parcel of land harvested under a salvage timber sale 
        conducted under subsection (b) as expeditiously as possible 
        after completion of the harvest on the parcel, but in no case

[[Page 109 STAT. 244]]

        later than any applicable restocking period required by law or 
        regulation.

        in which the affected Federal lands are located. Any challenge 
        to such sale must be filed in such district court within 15 days 
        after the date of initial advertisement of the challenged sale.

        grant, a waiver of the requirements of this paragraph.
            (2) Effect of filing on agency action.--For 45 days after

        a salvage timber sale pursuant to subsection (b) or any decision 
        to prepare, advertise, offer, award, or operate a timber sale 
        pursuant to subsection (d). Section 705 of title 5, United 
        States Code, shall not apply to any challenge to such a sale.
            (4) Standard of review.--The courts shall have authority to 
        enjoin permanently, order modification of, or void an individual 
        salvage timber sale if it is determined by a review of the 
        record that the decision to prepare, advertise, offer, award, or 
        operate such sale was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not 
        in accordance with applicable law (other than those laws 
        specified in subsection (i)).
            (5) Time for decision.--Civil actions filed under this 
        subsection shall be assigned for hearing at the earliest 
        possible date. The court shall render its final decision 
        relative to any challenge within 45 days from the date such 
        challenge is brought, unless the court determines that a longer 
        period of time is required to satisfy the requirement of the 
        United States Constitution. In order to reach a decision within

        actions which are shorter than the limits specified in the 
        Federal rules of civil or appellate procedure.
            (7) Appeal.--Any appeal from the final decision of a 
        district court in an action brought pursuant to this subsection 
        shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date of 
        decision.
