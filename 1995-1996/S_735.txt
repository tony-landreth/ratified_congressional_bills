criminal offense against the United States, or to test the validity of 
such person's detention pending removal proceedings.

appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from--

        the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a 
        State court; or

``Rule 22. Habeas corpus and section 2255 proceedings

    ``(a) Application for the Original Writ.--An application for a writ 
of habeas corpus shall be made to the appropriate district court. If 
application is made to a circuit judge, the application shall be 
transferred to the appropriate district court. If an application is made 
to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal of the 
application before a circuit judge shall not be permitted. The applicant 
may, pursuant to section 2253 of title 28, United States Code, appeal to 
the appropriate court of appeals from the order of the district court 
denying the writ.
    ``(b) Certificate of Appealability.--In a habeas corpus proceeding 
in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a 
State court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ may not proceed 
unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate of 
appealability pursuant to section 2253(c) of title 28, United States 
Code. If an appeal is taken by the applicant, the district judge who 
rendered the judgment shall either issue a certificate of appealability 
or state the reasons why such a certificate should not issue. The 
certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court of appeals 
with the notice of appeal and the file of the proceedings in the 
district court. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the 
applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a 
circuit judge. If such a request is addressed to the court of appeals, 
it shall be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be 
considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate. 
If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal 
shall be deemed to constitute a request addressed to the judges of the 
court of appeals. If an appeal is taken by a State or its 
representative, a certificate of appealability is not required.''.

SEC. 104. SECTION 2254 AMENDMENTS.

    Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--

        the courts of the State; or
            ``(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective 
        process; or
            ``(ii) circumstances exist that render such process 
        ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.

the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the 
remedies available in the courts of the State.

requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the

    ``(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a 
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be 
granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in 
State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--
            ``(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or 
        involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established 
        Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United 
        States; or
            ``(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an 
        unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence 
        presented in the State court proceeding.'';
            (4) by amending subsection (e), as redesignated by paragraph 
        (2), to read as follows:

    ``(e)(1) In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of

court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be 
presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting 
the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
    ``(2) If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a 
claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an 
evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that--
            ``(A) the claim relies on--
                    ``(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made 
                retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme 
                Court, that was previously unavailable; or
                    ``(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been 
                previously discovered through the exercise of due 
                diligence; and
            ``(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to 
        establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for 
        constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found 
        the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.''; and
            (5) by adding at the end the following new subsections:

    ``(h) Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances 
Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent 
proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel for an applicant 
who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel, except as 
provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to 
statutory authority. Appointment of counsel under this section shall be 
governed by section 3006A of title 18.
    ``(i) The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal 
or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground 
for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254.''.

resort or by statute a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and

litigation of collateral claims in the proceedings. The rule of court or

include an offer of counsel following trial for the purpose of 
representation on unitary review, and entry of an order, as provided in 
section 2261(c), concerning appointment of counsel or waiver or denial 
of appointment of counsel for that purpose. No counsel appointed to 
represent the prisoner in the unitary review proceedings shall have 
previously represented the prisoner at trial in the case for which the

`post-conviction review' and `direct review' in such sections shall be 
understood as referring to unitary review under the State procedure. The 
reference in section 2262(a) to `an order under section 2261(c)' shall 
be understood as referring to the post-trial order under subsection (b) 
concerning representation in the unitary review proceedings, but if a 
transcript of the trial proceedings is unavailable at the time of the

priority by the district court and by the court of appeals over all 
noncapital matters.

30-day period beyond the period specified in subparagraph (A), the 
rendering of a determination of an application for a writ of habeas

the reasons for the finding, that the ends of justice that would be 
served by allowing the delay outweigh the best interests of the public 
and the applicant in a speedy disposition of the application.
    ``(ii) The factors, among others, that a court shall consider in 
determining whether a delay in the disposition of an application is 
warranted are as follows:

        to result in a miscarriage of justice.

        the number of defendants, the nature of the prosecution, or the 
        existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is

        taken as a whole, is not so unusual or so complex as described 
        in subclause (II), but would otherwise deny the applicant 
        reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the 
        applicant or the government continuity of counsel, or would deny 
        counsel for the applicant or the government the reasonable time 
        necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the 
        exercise of due diligence.

general congestion of the court's calendar.

        appropriate.

pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the 
defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or

incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the 
victim or representative of the victim's estate, another family member,

SEC. 206. PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF RESTITUTION ORDER.

    (a) In General.--Section 3664 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 3664. Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of 
                        restitution

    ``(a) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  For orders of restitution under this 
title, the court shall order the probation officer to obtain and include 
in its presentence report, or in a separate report, as the court may 
direct, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion 
in fashioning a restitution order. The report shall include, to the 
extent practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, 
any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information 
relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant. If the number 
or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or other 
circumstances exist that make this requirement clearly impracticable, 
the probation officer shall so inform the court.

    ``(b) The court shall disclose to both the defendant and the 
attorney for the Government all portions of the presentence or

[[Page 110 STAT. 1233]]

other report pertaining to the matters described in subsection (a) of 
this section.
    ``(c) The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and Rule 32(c) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the only rules 
applicable to proceedings under this section.
    ``(d)(1) Upon the request of the probation officer, but not later 
than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing, the 
attorney for the Government, after consulting, to the extent 
practicable, with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the 
probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.
    ``(2) The probation officer shall, prior to submitting the 
presentence report under subsection (a), to the extent practicable--
            ``(A) provide notice to all identified victims of--
                    ``(i) the offense or offenses of which the defendant 
                was convicted;
                    ``(ii) the amounts subject to restitution submitted 
                to the probation officer;

                information to the probation officer concerning the 
                amount of the victim's losses;
                    ``(iv) the scheduled date, time, and place of the 
                sentencing hearing;

                victim pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B); and

                the probation officer a separate affidavit relating to 
                the amount of the victim's losses subject to 
                restitution; and
            ``(B) provide the victim with an affidavit form to submit 
        pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).

    ``(3) Each defendant shall prepare and file with the probation 
officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources of the 
defendant, including a complete listing of all assets owned or 
controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was 
arrested, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and 
the defendant's dependents, and such other information that the court 
requires relating to such other factors as the court deems appropriate.
    ``(4) After reviewing the report of the probation officer, the court 
may require additional documentation or hear testimony. 
The <<NOTE: Privacy.>>  privacy of any records filed, or testimony 
heard, pursuant to this section shall be maintained to the greatest 
extent possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in 
camera.

    ``(5) If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that 
is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the 
probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a 
date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 
90 days after sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers further 
losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in 
which to petition the court for an amended restitution order. Such order 
may be granted only upon a showing of good cause for the failure to 
include such losses in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.
    ``(6) The court may refer any issue arising in connection with a 
proposed order of restitution to a magistrate judge or special master 
for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to disposition, 
subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the court.

[[Page 110 STAT. 1234]]

    ``(e) Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution 
shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence. The 
burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as 
a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the Government. The 
burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the defendant and the 
financial needs of the defendant's dependents, shall be on the 
defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as the court 
deems appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the court as 
justice requires.
    ``(f)(1)(A) In each order of restitution, the court shall order 
restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim's losses as 
determined by the court and without consideration of the economic 
circumstances of the defendant.
    ``(B) In no case shall the fact that a victim has received or is 
entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance 
or any other source be considered in determining the amount of 
restitution.
    ``(2) Upon determination of the amount of restitution owed to each 
victim, the court shall, pursuant to section 3572, specify in the 
restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according to 
which, the restitution is to be paid, in consideration of--
            ``(A) the financial resources and other assets of the 
        defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly 
        controlled;
            ``(B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; 
        and
            ``(C) any financial obligations of the defendant; including 
        obligations to dependents.

    ``(3)(A) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make a 
single, lump-sum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-
kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and 
in-kind payments.
    ``(B) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal 
periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the 
economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the payment of any 
amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the payment of the 
full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any 
reasonable schedule of payments.
    ``(4) An in-kind payment described in paragraph (3) may be in the 
form of--
            ``(A) return of property;
            ``(B) replacement of property; or
            ``(C) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim 
        or a person or organization other than the victim.

    ``(g)(1) No victim shall be required to participate in any phase of 
a restitution order.
    ``(2) A victim may at any time assign the victim's interest in 
restitution payments to the Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury without 
in any way impairing the obligation of the defendant to make such 
payments.
    ``(h) If the court finds that more than 1 defendant has contributed 
to the loss of a victim, the court may make each defendant liable for 
payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability 
among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the 
victim's loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.

[[Page 110 STAT. 1235]]

    ``(i) If the court finds that more than 1 victim has sustained a 
loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the court may provide for a 
different payment schedule for each victim based on the type and amount 
of each victim's loss and accounting for the economic circumstances of 
each victim. In any case in which the United States is a victim, the 
court shall ensure that all other victims receive full restitution 
before the United States receives any restitution.
    ``(j)(1) If a victim has received compensation from insurance or any 
other source with respect to a loss, the court shall order that 
restitution be paid to the person who provided or is obligated to 
provide the compensation, but the restitution order shall provide that 
all restitution of victims required by the order be paid to the victims 
before any restitution is paid to such a provider of compensation.
    ``(2) Any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution 
shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages 
for the same loss by the victim in--
            ``(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and
            ``(B) any State civil proceeding, to the extent provided by 
        the law of the State.

    ``(k) A restitution order shall provide that the defendant shall 
notify the court and the Attorney General of any material change in the 
defendant's economic circumstances that might affect the defendant's 
ability to pay restitution. The court may also accept notification of a 
material change in the defendant's economic circumstances from the 
United States or from the victim. <<NOTE: Certification.>>  The Attorney 
General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed 
restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change in 
circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its 
own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the 
payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests 
of justice require.

    ``(l) A conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act 
giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the defendant from 
denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent 
Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent 
consistent with State law, brought by the victim.
    ``(m)(1)(A)(i) An order of restitution may be enforced by the United 
States in the manner provided for in subchapter C of chapter 227 and 
subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or
    ``(ii) by all other available and reasonable means.
    ``(B) At the request of a victim named in a restitution order, the 
clerk of the court shall issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a 
judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount 
specified in the restitution order. Upon registering, recording, 
docketing, or indexing such abstract in accordance with the rules and 
requirements relating to judgments of the court of the State where the 
district court is located, the abstract of judgment shall be a lien on 
the property of the defendant located in such State in the same manner 
and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a 
court of general jurisdiction in that State.
    ``(2) An order of in-kind restitution in the form of services shall 
be enforced by the probation officer.

such person shall be required to apply the value of such resources to 
any restitution or fine still owed.

judgment notwithstanding the fact that--

    ``(a) Enforcement.--The United States may enforce a judgment 
imposing a fine in accordance with the practices and procedures for the 
enforcement of a civil judgment under Federal law or State law. 
Notwithstanding any other Federal law (including section 207 of the 
Social Security Act), a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against 
all property or rights to property of the person fined, except that--
            ``(1) property exempt from levy for taxes pursuant to 
        section 6334(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10), 
        and (12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be exempt 
        from enforcement of the judgment under Federal law;
            ``(2) section 3014 of chapter 176 of title 28 shall not 
        apply to enforcement under Federal law; and
            ``(3) the provisions of section 303 of the Consumer Credit 
        Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1673) shall apply to enforcement of 
        the judgment under Federal law or State law.

    ``(b) Termination of Liability.--The liability to pay a fine shall 
terminate the later of 20 years from the entry of judgment or 20 years 
after the release from imprisonment of the person fined, or upon the 
death of the individual fined.

[[Page 110 STAT. 1239]]

    ``(c) Lien.--A fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of subchapter 
C of chapter 227 of this title, or an order of restitution made pursuant 
to sections 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, 3663A, or 3664 of this title, 
is a lien in favor of the United States on all property and rights to 
property of the person fined as if the liability of the person fined 
were a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986. The lien arises on the entry of judgment and continues for 20 
years or until the liability is satisfied, remitted, set aside, or is 
terminated under subsection (b).
    ``(d) Effect of Filing Notice of Lien.--Upon filing of a notice of 
lien in the manner in which a notice of tax lien would be filed under 
section 6323(f) (1) and (2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the 
lien shall be valid against any purchaser, holder of a security 
interest, mechanic's lienor or judgment lien creditor, except with 
respect to properties or transactions specified in subsection (b), (c), 
or (d) of section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for which a 
notice of tax lien properly filed on the same date would not be valid. 
The notice of lien shall be considered a notice of lien for taxes 
payable to the United States for the purpose of any State or local law 
providing for the filing of a notice of a tax lien. A notice of lien 
that is registered, recorded, docketed, or indexed in accordance with 
the rules and requirements relating to judgments of the courts of the 
State where the notice of lien is registered, recorded, docketed, or 
indexed shall be considered for all purposes as the filing prescribed by 
this section. The provisions of section 3201(e) of chapter 176 of title 
28 shall apply to liens filed as prescribed by this section.
    ``(e) Discharge of Debt Inapplicable.--No discharge of debts in a 
proceeding pursuant to any chapter of title 11, United States Code, 
shall discharge liability to pay a fine pursuant to this section, and a 
lien filed as prescribed by this section shall not be voided in a 
bankruptcy proceeding.
    ``(f) Applicability to Order of Restitution.--In accordance with 
section 3664(m)(1)(A) of this title, all provisions of this section are 
available to the United States for the enforcement of an order of 
restitution.''.
            (4) Default.--Chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code, 
        is amended by inserting after section 3613 the following new 
        section:

payment of a fine or restitution, the court may, pursuant to section 
3565, revoke probation or a term of supervised release, modify the terms 
or conditions of probation or a term of supervised release, resentence a 
defendant pursuant to section 3614, hold the defendant in contempt of 
court, enter a restraining order or injunction, order the sale of 
property of the defendant, accept a performance bond, enter or adjust a 
payment schedule, or take any other action necessary to obtain 
compliance with the order of a fine or restitution.
    ``(2) In determining what action to take, the court shall consider 
the defendant's employment status, earning ability, financial resources, 
the willfulness in failing to comply with the fine or restitution order, 
and any other circumstances that may have a

[[Page 110 STAT. 1240]]

bearing on the defendant's ability or failure to comply with the order 
of a fine or restitution.
    ``(b)(1) Any hearing held pursuant to this section may be conducted 
by a magistrate judge, subject to de novo review by the court.
    ``(2) To the extent practicable, in a hearing held pursuant to this 
section involving a defendant who is confined in any jail, prison, or 
other correctional facility, proceedings in which the prisoner's 
participation is required or permitted shall be conducted by telephone, 
video conference, or other communications technology without removing 
the prisoner from the facility in which the prisoner is confined.''.
            (5) Resentencing.--Section 3614 of title 18, United States 
        Code, is amended--

                restitution'' after ``fine''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new 
                subsection:

    ``(c) Effect of Indigency.--In no event shall a defendant be 
incarcerated under this section solely on the basis of inability to make 
payments because the defendant is indigent.''.
    (d) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
subchapter B of chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code, is amended 
to read as follows:

``Sec.
``3611. Payment of a fine or restitution.

        readily available criminal debt payment tracking system operated 
        by the agency responsible for the collection of criminal debt 
        has established cost-effective, readily available communications 
        links with entities that administer Federal victim compensation

             TITLE III--INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM PROHIBITIONS

     Subtitle A--Prohibition on International Terrorist Fundraising

SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 18 USC 2339B note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) international terrorism is a serious and deadly problem 
        that threatens the vital interests of the United States;
            (2) the Constitution confers upon Congress the power to 
        punish crimes against the law of nations and to carry out the 
        treaty obligations of the United States, and therefore Congress 
        may by law impose penalties relating to the provision of 
        material support to foreign organizations engaged in terrorist 
        activity;
            (3) the power of the United States over immigration and 
        naturalization permits the exclusion from the United States of 
        persons belonging to international terrorist organizations;
            (4) international terrorism affects the interstate and 
        foreign commerce of the United States by harming international 
        trade and market stability, and limiting international travel by 
        United States citizens as well as foreign visitors to the United 
        States;
            (5) international cooperation is required for an effective 
        response to terrorism, as demonstrated by the numerous 
        multilateral conventions in force providing universal 
        prosecutive jurisdiction over persons involved in a variety of 
        terrorist acts, including hostage taking, murder of an 
        internationally protected person, and aircraft piracy and 
        sabotage;
            (6) some foreign terrorist organizations, acting through 
        affiliated groups or individuals, raise significant funds within 
        the United States, or use the United States as a conduit for the 
        receipt of funds raised in other nations; and
            (7) foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity 
        are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution 
        to such an organization facilitates that conduct.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to provide the Federal 
Government the fullest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution, 
to prevent persons within the United States, or subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, from providing material support or 
resources to foreign organizations that engage in terrorist activities.

SEC. 324. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2377 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) international terrorism is among the most serious 
        transnational threats faced by the United States and its allies, 
        far eclipsing the dangers posed by population growth or 
        pollution;
            (2) the President should continue to make efforts to counter 
        international terrorism a national security priority;
            (3) because the United Nations has been an inadequate forum 
        for the discussion of cooperative, multilateral responses to the 
        threat of international terrorism, the President should 
        undertake immediate efforts to develop effective multilateral 
        responses to international terrorism as a complement to national 
        counter terrorist efforts;
            (4) the President should use all necessary means, including 
        covert action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle, and 
        destroy international infrastructure used by international 
        terrorists, including overseas terrorist training facilities and 
        safe havens;
            (5) the Congress deplores decisions to ease, evade, or end 
        international sanctions on state sponsors of terrorism, 
        including the recent decision by the United Nations Sanctions 
        Committee to allow airline flights to and from Libya despite 
        Libya's noncompliance with United Nations resolutions; and
            (6) the President should continue to undertake efforts to 
        increase the international isolation of state sponsors of 
        international terrorism, including efforts to strengthen 
        international sanctions, and should oppose any future 
        initiatives to ease sanctions on Libya or other state sponsors 
        of terrorism.

        whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, or 
        other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing 
        that the presence of the witness is necessary for the

        ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of 
        Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness

        oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.

        requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process 
        and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds

whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. 
The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to 
reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.
    ``(g) Burden of Proof.--In the hearing, it is the Government's 
burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is

apply in a removal hearing.

the evidence on the record as a whole, finds that the Government has met

     TITLE V--NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS RESTRICTIONS

                      Subtitle A--Nuclear Materials

SEC. 501. <<NOTE: 18 USC 831 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) nuclear materials, including byproduct materials, can be 
        used to create radioactive dispersal devices that are capable of 
        causing serious bodily injury as well as substantial damage to 
        property and to the environment;
            (2) the potential use of nuclear materials, including 
        byproduct materials, enhances the threat posed by terrorist 
        activities and thereby has a greater effect on the security 
        interests of the United States;
            (3) due to the widespread hazards presented by the threat of 
        nuclear contamination, as well as nuclear bombs, the United 
        States has a strong interest in ensuring that persons who are 
        engaged in the illegal acquisition and use of nuclear materials, 
        including byproduct materials, are prosecuted for their 
        offenses;
            (4) the threat that nuclear materials will be obtained and 
        used by terrorist and other criminal organizations has increased 
        substantially since the enactment in 1982 of the legislation 
        that implemented the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
        Nuclear Material, codified at section 831 of title 18, United 
        States Code;
            (5) the successful efforts to obtain agreements from other 
        countries to dismantle nuclear weapons have resulted in 
        increased packaging and transportation of nuclear materials, 
        thereby decreasing the security of such materials by increasing 
        the opportunity for unlawful diversion and theft;
            (6) the trafficking in the relatively more common, 
        commercially available, and usable nuclear and byproduct 
        materials creates the potential for significant loss of life and 
        environmental damage;
            (7) report trafficking incidents in the early 1990's suggest 
        that the individuals involved in trafficking in these materials 
        from Eurasia and Eastern Europe frequently conducted their black 
        market sales of these materials within the Federal Republic of 
        Germany, the Baltic States, the former Soviet Union, Central 
        Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Middle European countries;

[[Page 110 STAT. 1282]]

            (8) the international community has become increasingly 
        concerned over the illegal possession of nuclear and nuclear 
        byproduct materials;
            (9) the potentially disastrous ramifications of increased 
        access to nuclear and nuclear byproduct materials pose such a 
        significant threat that the United States must use all lawful 
        methods available to combat the illegal use of such materials;
            (10) the United States has an interest in encouraging United 
        States corporations to do business in the countries that 
        comprised the former Soviet Union, and in other developing 
        democracies;
            (11) protection of such United States corporations from 
        threats created by the unlawful use of nuclear materials is 
        important to the success of the effort to encourage business 
        ventures in these countries, and to further the foreign 
        relations and commerce of the United States;
            (12) the nature of nuclear contamination is such that it may 
        affect the health, environment, and property of United States 
        nationals even if the acts that constitute the illegal activity 
        occur outside the territory of the United States, and are 
        primarily directed toward foreign nationals; and
            (13) there is presently no Federal criminal statute that 
        provides adequate protection to United States interests from 
        nonweapons grade, yet hazardous radioactive material, and from 
        the illegal diversion of nuclear materials that are held for 
        other than peaceful purposes.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide Federal law 
enforcement agencies with the necessary means and the maximum authority 
permissible under the Constitution to combat the threat of nuclear 
contamination and proliferation that may result from the illegal 
possession and use of radioactive materials.

                to the defendant to exist, that are likely to cause the 
                death or serious bodily injury to any person, or 
                substantial damage to property or to the environment;''; 
                and
                    (C) in paragraph (6), by inserting ``or to the

            (2) in subsection (c)--
                    (A) so that paragraph (2) reads as follows:
            ``(2) an offender or a victim is--
                    ``(A) a national of the United States; or
                    ``(B) a United States corporation or other legal 
                entity;'';

[[Page 110 STAT. 1283]]

                          (i) by striking ``at the time of the offense 
                      the nuclear material is in use, storage, or 
                      transport, for peaceful purposes, and''; and
                          (ii) by striking ``or'' at the end of the 
                      paragraph;
                    (C) in paragraph (4)--
                          (i) by striking ``nuclear material for 
                      peaceful purposes'' and inserting ``nuclear 
                      material or nuclear byproduct material''; and
                          (ii) by striking the period at the end of the 
                      paragraph and inserting ``; or''; and
                    (D) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraph:
            ``(5) either--
                    ``(A) the governmental entity under subsection 
                (a)(5) is the United States; or
                    ``(B) the threat under subsection (a)(6) is directed

Evaluation of Personnel Who Respond To Use of Chemical or Biological 
Weapons in Urban and Suburban Areas.--
            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
                    (A) the threat of the use of chemical and biological 
                weapons by Third World countries and by terrorist 
                organizations has increased in recent years and is now a 
                problem of worldwide significance;
                    (B) the military and law enforcement agencies in the 
                United States that are responsible for responding to the 
                use of such weapons require additional testing, 
                training, and evaluation facilities to ensure that the 
                personnel of such agencies discharge their 
                responsibilities effectively; and
                    (C) a facility that recreates urban and suburban 
                locations would provide an especially effective 
                environment

                advisability of establishing a facility that recreates 
                both an urban environment and a suburban environment in 
                such a way as to permit the effective testing, training, 
                and evaluation in such environments of government 
                personnel who are responsible for responding to the use 
                of chemical and biological weapons in the United States.
                    (B) Description of facility.--The facility

        TITLE VI--IMPLEMENTATION OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES CONVENTION

SEC. 601. <<NOTE: 18 USC 841 note.>>  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--

[[Page 110 STAT. 1288]]

            (1) plastic explosives were used by terrorists in the 
        bombings of Pan American Airlines flight number 103 in December 
        1988 and UTA flight number 722 in September 1989;
            (2) plastic explosives can be used with little likelihood of 
        detection for acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation, 
        maritime navigation, and other modes of transportation;
            (3) the criminal use of plastic explosives places innocent 
        lives in jeopardy, endangers national security, affects domestic 
        tranquility, and gravely affects interstate and foreign 
        commerce;
            (4) the marking of plastic explosives for the purpose of 
        detection would contribute significantly to the prevention and 
        punishment of such unlawful acts; and
            (5) for the purpose of deterring and detecting such unlawful 
        acts, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for 
        the Purpose of Detection, Done at Montreal on 1 March 1991, 
        requires each contracting State to adopt appropriate measures to 
        ensure that plastic explosives are duly marked and controlled.

            (1) United States currency is being counterfeited outside 
        the United States.
            (2) The One Hundred Third Congress enacted, with the 
        approval of the President on September 13, 1994, section 470 of 
        title 18, United States Code, making such activity a crime under 
        the laws of the United States.
            (3) The expeditious posting of agents of the United States 
        Secret Service to overseas posts, which is necessary for the 
        effective enforcement of section 470 and related criminal 
        provisions, has been delayed.
            (4) While section 470 of title 18, United States Code, 
        provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years as 
        opposed to a maximum term of 15 years for domestic 
        counterfeiting, the United States Sentencing Commission has 
        failed to provide, in its sentencing guidelines, for an 
        appropriate enhancement of punishment for defendants convicted 
        of counterfeiting United States currency outside the United 
        States.

    (g) Timely Consideration of Requests for Concurrence in Creation of

                number of agents of the United States Secret Service as 
                the Secretary of the Treasury considers appropriate in 
                posts in overseas embassies; and
                    (B) reach an agreement with the Secretary of the 
                Treasury on such posts as soon as possible and, in any 
                event, not later than December 31, 1996.
            (2) Cooperation of treasury required.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury shall promptly provide any information requested by the 
        Secretary of State in connection with such requests.

[[Page 110 STAT. 1310]]

            (3) Reports required.--The Secretary of the Treasury and the

        Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate explaining the 
        reasons for the rejection, if any, of any proposed post and the 
        reasons for the failure, if any, to fill any approved post by 
        such date.

    (h) Enhanced Penalties for International Counterfeiting of United 
States Currency.--Pursuant to the authority of the United States 
Sentencing Commission under section 994 of title 28, United States Code, 
the Commission shall amend the sentencing guidelines prescribed by the 
Commission to provide an appropriate enhancement of the punishment for a 
defendant convicted under section 470 of title 18 of such Code.

                handgun caliber ammunition and shotguns;
                    (C) those officers feloniously killed or seriously

                prohibition on non-law enforcement sales of such 
                ammunition, if such ammunition is capable of penetrating 
                minimum level bullet resistant vests; and
