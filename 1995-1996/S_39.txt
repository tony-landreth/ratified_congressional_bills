        where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish 
        have been so substantially reduced in number that they could 
        become similarly threatened as a consequence of (A) increased 
        fishing pressure, (B) the inadequacy of fishery resource 
        conservation and management practices and controls, or (C) 
        direct and indirect habitat losses which have resulted in a 
        diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels.'';

        considerations should receive increased attention for the 
        conservation and management of fishery resources of the United 
        States.

        shall recommend criteria, consistent with the provisions of this 
        Act, that a fisherman must meet to qualify for guarantees under 
        clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) and the portion of 
        funds to be allocated for guarantees under each clause.
            ``(5) In submitting and approving any new individual fishing 
        quota program on or after October 1, 2000, the Councils and the 
        Secretary shall consider the report of the National Academy of 
        Sciences required under section 108(f) of the Sustainable 
        Fisheries Act, and any recommendations contained in such report, 
        and shall ensure that any such program--
                    ``(A) establishes procedures and requirements for 
                the review and revision of the terms of any such program 
                (including any revisions that may be necessary once a 
                national policy with respect to individual fishing quota 
                programs is implemented), and, if appropriate, for the 
                renewal, reallocation, or reissuance of individual 
                fishing quotas;
                    ``(B) provides for the effective enforcement and 
                management of any such program, including adequate 
                observer coverage, and for fees under section 304(d)(2) 
                to recover actual costs directly related to such 
                enforcement and management; and
                    ``(C) provides for a fair and equitable initial

                person from acquiring an excessive share of the 
                individual fishing quotas issued, and considers the 
                allocation of a portion of the annual harvest in the 
                fishery for entry-level fishermen, small vessel owners, 
                and crew members who do not hold or qualify for 
                individual fishing quotas.''.

    (f) Individual Fishing Quota <<NOTE: 16 USC 1853 note.>> Report.--
(1) Not later than October 1, 1998, the National Academy of Sciences, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Regional Fishery 
Management Councils, shall submit to the Congress a comprehensive final 
report on individual fishing quotas, which shall include recommendations 
to implement a national policy with respect to individual fishing 
quotas. The report shall address all aspects of such quotas, including 
an analysis of--
            (A) the effects of limiting or prohibiting the 
        transferability of such quotas;
            (B) mechanisms to prevent foreign control of the harvest of 
        United States fisheries under individual fishing quota programs, 
        including mechanisms to prohibit persons who are not eligible to 
        be deemed a citizen of the United States for the purpose of 
        operating a vessel in the coastwise trade under section 2(a) and 
        section 2(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. 802 (a) and 
        (c)) from holding individual fishing quotas;
            (C) the impact of limiting the duration of individual 
        fishing quota programs;
            (D) the impact of authorizing Federal permits to process a 
        quantity of fish that correspond to individual fishing quotas, 
        and of the value created for recipients of any such permits, 
        including a comparison of such value to the value of the 
        corresponding individual fishing quotas;
            (E) mechanisms to provide for diversity and to minimize 
        adverse social and economic impacts on fishing communities, 
        other fisheries affected by the displacement of vessels, and any 
        impacts associated with the shifting of capital value from 
        fishing vessels to individual fishing quotas, as well as the use 
        of capital construction funds to purchase individual fishing 
        quotas;
            (F) mechanisms to provide for effective monitoring and 
        enforcement, including the inspection of fish harvested and 
        incentives to reduce bycatch, and in particular economic 
        discards;
            (G) threshold criteria for determining whether a fishery may 
        be considered for individual fishing quota management, including 
        criteria related to the geographical range, population dynamics 
        and condition of a fish stock, the socioeconomic characteristics 
        of a fishery (including participants' involvement in multiple 
        fisheries in the region), and participation by commercial, 
        charter, and recreational fishing sectors in the fishery;
            (H) mechanisms to ensure that vessel owners, vessel masters, 
        crew members, and United States fish processors are treated 
        fairly and equitably in initial allocations, to require persons 
        holding individual fishing quotas to be on board the vessel 
        using such quotas, and to facilitate new entry under individual 
        fishing quota programs;
            (I) potential social and economic costs and benefits to the 
        nation, individual fishing quota recipients, and any recipients 
        of Federal permits described in subparagraph (D) under 
        individual fishing quota programs, including from capital gains 
        revenue, the allocation of such quotas or permits through 
        Federal auctions, annual fees and transfer fees at various 
        levels, or other measures;
            (J) the value created for recipients of individual fishing 
        quotas, including a comparison of such value to the value of the 
        fish harvested under such quotas and to the value of permits 
        created by other types of limited access systems, and the 
        effects of creating such value on fishery management and 
        conservation; and
            (K) such other matters as the National Academy of Sciences 
        deems appropriate.
            (2) The report shall include a detailed analysis of 
        individual fishing quota programs already implemented in the 
        United States, including the impacts: of any limits on 
        transferability, on past and present participants, on fishing 
        communities, on the rate and total amount of bycatch (including 
        economic and regulatory discards) in the fishery, on the safety 
        of life and vessels in the fishery, on any excess harvesting or 
        processing capacity in the fishery, on any gear conflicts in the 
        fishery, on product quality from the fishery, on the 
        effectiveness of enforcement in the fishery, on the size and 
        composition of fishing vessel fleets, on the economic value 
        created by individual fishing quotas for initial recipients and 
        non-recipients, on conservation of the fishery resource, on 
        fishermen who rely on participation in several fisheries, on the 
        success in meeting any fishery management plan goals, and the 
        fairness and effectiveness of the methods used for allocating 
        quotas and controlling transferability. The report shall also 
        include any information about individual fishing quota programs 
        in other countries that may be useful.
            (3) The report shall identify and analyze alternative 
        conservation and management measures, including other limited 
        access systems such as individual transferable effort systems, 
        that could accomplish the same objectives as individual fishing 
        quota programs, as well as characteristics that are unique to 
        individual fishing quota programs.
            (4) <<NOTE: Establishment.>>  The Secretary of Commerce 
        shall, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, 
        the Councils, the fishing industry, affected States, 
        conservation organizations and other interested persons, 
        establish two individual fishing quota review groups to assist 
        in the preparation of the report, which shall represent: (A) 
        Alaska, Hawaii, and the other Pacific coastal States; and (B) 
        Atlantic coastal States and the Gulf of Mexico coastal States. 
        The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, achieve a 
        balanced representation of viewpoints among the individuals on 
        each review group. The review groups shall be deemed to be 
        advisory panels under section 302(g) of the Magnuson Fishery 
        Conservation and Management Act, as amended by this Act.
            (5) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the 
        National Academy of Sciences and the Councils, shall conduct 
        public hearings in each Council region to obtain comments on 
        individual fishing quotas for use by the National Academy of 
        Sciences in preparing the report required by this subsection. 
        The <<NOTE: Reports.>> National Academy of Sciences shall submit 
        a draft report to the Secretary of Commerce by January 1, 
        1998. <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>> The Secretary of 
        Commerce shall publish in the Federal Register a notice and 
        opportunity for public comment on the draft of the report, or 
        any revision thereof. A detailed summary of comments received 
        and views presented at the hearings, including any dissenting 
        views, shall be included by the National Academy of Sciences in 
        the final report.
            (6) Section 210 of Public Law <<NOTE: 16 USC 1851 note.>>  
        104-134 is hereby repealed.

    (g) North Pacific Loan Program.--(1) By not later than October 1, 
1997 the North Pacific Fishery Management Council shall recommend to the 
Secretary of Commerce a program which uses the full amount of fees 
authorized to be used under section 303(d)(4) of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act, as amended by this Act, in the halibut 
and sablefish fisheries off Alaska to guarantee obligations in 
accordance with such section.
    (2)(A) For the purposes of this subsection, the phrase ``fishermen 
who fish from small vessels'' in section 303(d)(4)(A)(i) of such Act 
shall mean fishermen wishing to purchase individual fishing quotas for 
use from Category B, Category C, or Category D vessels, as defined in 
part 676.20(c) of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations (as revised as 
of October 1, 1995), whose aggregate ownership of individual fishing 
quotas will not exceed the equivalent of a total of 50,000 pounds of 
halibut and sablefish harvested in the fishing year in which a guarantee 
application is made if the guarantee is approved, who will participate 
aboard the fishing vessel in the harvest of fish caught under such 
quotas, who have at least 150 days of experience working as part of the 
harvesting crew in any United States commercial fishery, and who do not 
own in whole or in part any Category A or Category B vessel, as defined 
in such part and title of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (B) For the purposes of this subsection, the phrase ``entry level 
fishermen'' in section 303(d)(4)(A)(ii) of such Act shall mean fishermen 
who do not own any individual fishing quotas, who wish to obtain the 
equivalent of not more than a total of 8,000 pounds of halibut and 
sablefish harvested in the fishing year in which a guarantee application 
is made, and who will participate aboard the fishing vessel in the 
harvest of fish caught under such quotas.
    (h) <<NOTE: Reports. 16 USC 1855 note.>>  Community Development 
Quota Report.--Not later than October 1, 1998, the National Academy of 
Sciences, in consultation with the Secretary, the North Pacific and 
Western Pacific Councils, communities and organizations participating in 
the program, participants in affected fisheries, and the affected 
States, shall submit to the Secretary of Commerce and Congress a 
comprehensive report on the performance and effectiveness of the 
community development quota programs under the authority of the North 
Pacific and Western Pacific Councils. The report shall--
            (1) evaluate the extent to which such programs have met the 
        objective of providing communities with the means to develop 
        ongoing commercial fishing activities;
            (2) evaluate the manner and extent to which such programs 
        have resulted in the communities and residents--
                    (A) receiving employment opportunities in commercial 
                fishing and processing; and
                    (B) obtaining the capital necessary to invest in 
                commercial fishing, fish processing, and commercial 
                fishing support projects (including infrastructure to 
                support commercial fishing);
            (3) evaluate the social and economic conditions in the 
        participating communities and the extent to which alternative 
        private sector employment opportunities exist;
            (4) evaluate the economic impacts on participants in the 
        affected fisheries, taking into account the condition of the 
        fishery resource, the market, and other relevant factors;
            (5) recommend a proposed schedule for accomplishing the 
        developmental purposes of community development quotas; and
            (6) address such other matters as the National Academy of 
        Sciences deems appropriate.

    (i) <<NOTE: 16 USC 1853 note.>>  Existing Quota Plans.--Nothing in 
this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to 
require a reallocation of individual fishing quotas under any individual 
fishing quota program approved by the Secretary before January 4, 1995.

SEC. 109. ACTION BY THE SECRETARY.

    (a) Secretarial Review of Plans and Regulations.--Section 304 (16 
U.S.C. 1854) is amended by striking subsections (a) and (b) and 
inserting the following:
    ``(a) Review of Plans.--

                persons on the plan or amendment may be submitted to the 
                Secretary during the 60-day period beginning on the date 
                the notice is published.
            ``(2) In undertaking the review required under paragraph

        end of the comment period of the approval, disapproval, or 
        partial approval of a plan or amendment, then such plan or 
        amendment shall take effect as if approved.
            ``(4) If the Secretary disapproves or partially approves a 
        plan or amendment, the Council may submit a revised plan or

        the term `immediately' means on or before the 5th day after the 
        day on which a Council transmits to the Secretary a fishery 
        management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulation that the 
        Council characterizes as final.

    ``(b) Review of Regulations.--
            ``(1) Upon transmittal by the Council to the Secretary of 
        proposed regulations prepared under section 303(c), the 
        Secretary shall immediately initiate an evaluation of the 
        proposed regulations to determine whether they are consistent 
        with the fishery management plan, plan amendment, this Act and 
        other applicable law. Within 15 days of initiating such 
        evaluation the Secretary shall make a determination and--

                writing of the inconsistencies and provide 
                recommendations on revisions that would make the 
                proposed regulations consistent with the fishery 
                management plan, plan amendment, this Act, and other 
                applicable law.
            ``(2) Upon receiving a notification under paragraph (1)(B),

        within 30 days after the end of the comment period under 
        paragraph (1)(A). <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>>  The 
        Secretary shall consult with the Council before making any 
        revisions to the proposed regulations, and must publish in the 
        Federal Register an explanation of any differences between the 
        proposed and final regulations.''.

    (b) Preparation by the Secretary.--Section 304(c) (16 U.S.C. 
1854(c)) is amended--

Section 304(d) (16 U.S.C. 1854(d)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' immediately before the first 
        sentence; and
            (2) by inserting at the end the following:
            ``(2)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary is 
        authorized and shall collect a fee to recover the actual costs 
        directly related to the management and enforcement of any--
                    ``(i) individual fishing quota program; and
                    ``(ii) community development quota program that 
                allocates a percentage of the total allowable catch of a 
                fishery to such program.
            ``(B) Such fee shall not exceed 3 percent of the ex-vessel 
        value of fish harvested under any such program, and shall be 
        collected at either the time of the landing, filing of a landing 
        report, or sale of such fish during a fishing season or in the 
        last quarter of the calendar year in which the fish is 
        harvested.
            ``(C)(i) Fees collected under this paragraph shall be in 
        addition to any other fees charged under this Act and shall be 
        deposited in the Limited Access System Administration Fund

        appropriations, to cover the costs of new direct loan 
        obligations and new loan guarantee commitments as required by 
        section 504(b)(1) of the Federal Credit Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 
        661c(b)(1)).

        transfer to such State up to 33 percent of any fee collected 
        pursuant to subparagraph (A) under a community development quota 
        program and deposited in the Limited Access System 
        Administration Fund in order to reimburse such State for actual 
        costs directly incurred in the management and enforcement of 
        such program.''.

    (d) <<NOTE: 16 USC 1854 note.>>  Delay of Fees.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, the Secretary shall not begin the collection of 
fees under section 304(d)(2) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act, as amended by this Act, in the surf clam and ocean 
(including mahogany) quahog fishery or in the wreckfish fishery until 
after January 1, 2000.

    (e) Overfishing.--Section 304(e) (16 U.S.C. 1854(e)) is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(e) Rebuilding Overfished Fisheries.--
            ``(1) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  The Secretary shall report 
        annually to the Congress and the Councils on the status of 
        fisheries within each Council's geographical area of authority 
        and identify those fisheries that are overfished or are 
        approaching a condition of being overfished. For those fisheries 
        managed under a fishery management plan or international 
        agreement, the status shall be determined using the criteria for 
        overfishing specified in such plan or agreement. A fishery shall 
        be classified as approaching a condition of being overfished if, 
        based on trends in fishing effort, fishery resource size, and 
        other appropriate factors, the Secretary estimates that the 
        fishery will become overfished within two years.
            ``(2) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  If the Secretary determines 
        at any time that a fishery is overfished, the Secretary shall 
        immediately notify the appropriate Council and request that 
        action be taken to end overfishing in the fishery and to 
        implement conservation and management measures to rebuild 
        affected stocks of fish. The <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
        publication.>>  Secretary shall publish each notice under this 
        paragraph in the Federal Register.
            ``(3) Within one year of an identification under paragraph 
        (1) or notification under paragraphs (2) or (7), the appropriate 
        Council (or the Secretary, for fisheries under section 
        302(a)(3)) shall prepare a fishery management plan, plan 
        amendment, or proposed regulations for the fishery to which the 
        identification or notice applies--
                    ``(A) to end overfishing in the fishery and to 
                rebuild affected stocks of fish; or
                    ``(B) to prevent overfishing from occurring in the 
                fishery whenever such fishery is identified as 
                approaching an overfished condition.

        management plan, amendment, or proposed regulations prepared 
        pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (5) for such fishery

                      recommendations by international organizations in 
                      which the United States participates, and the 
                      interaction of the overfished stock of fish within 
                      the marine ecosystem; and
                          ``(ii) not exceed 10 years, except in cases 
                      where the biology of the stock of fish, other 
                      environmental conditions, or management measures 
                      under an international agreement in which the 
                      United States participates dictate otherwise;

                recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of 
                the fishery; and

                agreement, reflect traditional participation in the 
                fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the 
                United States.
            ``(5) If, within the one-year period beginning on the date 
        of identification or notification that a fishery is overfished, 
        the Council does not submit to the Secretary a fishery 
        management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations 
        required by paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary shall prepare a 
        fishery management plan or plan amendment and any accompanying 
        regulations to stop overfishing and rebuild affected stocks of 
        fish within 9 months under subsection (c).
            ``(6) During the development of a fishery management plan, a 
        plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by this 
        subsection, the Council may request the Secretary to implement 
        interim measures to reduce overfishing under section 305(c) 
        until such measures can be replaced by such plan, amendment, or 
        regulations. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the 
        provisions of this Act, may be implemented even though they are 
        not sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.
            ``(7) The Secretary shall review any fishery management 
        plan, plan amendment, or regulations required by this subsection 
        at routine intervals that may not exceed two years. If the 
        Secretary finds as a result of the review that such plan, 
        amendment, or regulations have not resulted in adequate progress 
        toward ending overfishing and rebuilding affected fish stocks, 
        the Secretary shall--
                    ``(A) in the case of a fishery to which section 
                302(a)(3) applies, immediately make revisions necessary 
                to achieve adequate progress; or
                    ``(B) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  for all other 
                fisheries, immediately notify the appropriate Council. 
                Such notification shall recommend further conservation 
                and management measures which the Council should 
                consider under paragraph (3) to achieve adequate 
                progress.''.

    (f) Fisheries under Authority of More Than One Council.--Section 
304(f) is amended by striking paragraph (3).
    (g) Atlantic Highly Migratory Species.--Section 304 (16 U.S.C. 1854) 
is amended further by striking subsection (g) and inserting the 
following:
    ``(g) Atlantic Highly Migratory Species.--(1) Preparation and 
implementation of plan or plan amendment.--The Secretary shall prepare a 
fishery management plan or plan amendment under subsection (c) with 
respect to any highly migratory species fishery to which section 
302(a)(3) applies. In preparing and implementing any such plan or 
amendment, the Secretary shall--
            ``(A) consult with and consider the comments and views of 
        affected Councils, commissioners and advisory groups appointed 
        under Acts implementing relevant international fishery 
        agreements pertaining to highly migratory species, and the 
        advisory panel established under section 302(g);

        each fishery management plan to be prepared under this 
        paragraph;

        and management measures on participants in the affected 
        fisheries and minimize, to the extent practicable, any 
        disadvantage to United States fishermen in relation to foreign 
        competitors;
            ``(D) with respect to a highly migratory species for which 
        the United States is authorized to harvest an allocation, quota,

    (h) <<NOTE: 16 USC 1854 note.>>  Comprehensive Management System for 
Atlantic Pelagic Longline Fishery.--(1) The Secretary of Commerce 
shall--
            (A) establish an advisory panel under section 302(g)(4) of 
        the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended 
        by this Act, for pelagic longline fishing vessels that 
        participate in fisheries for Atlantic highly migratory species;
            (B) conduct surveys and workshops with affected fishery 
        participants to provide information and identify options for 
        future management programs;
            (C) to the extent practicable and necessary for the 
        evaluation of options for a comprehensive management system, 
        recover vessel production records; and
            (D) complete by January 1, 1998, a comprehensive study on 
        the feasibility of implementing a comprehensive management 
        system for pelagic longline fishing vessels that participate in 
        fisheries for Atlantic highly migratory species, including, but 
        not limited to, individual fishing quota programs and other 
        limited access systems.

    (2) Based on the study under paragraph (1)(D) and consistent with 
the requirements of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), in cooperation with affected participants in 
the fishery, the United States Commissioners on the International 
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, and the advisory 
panel established under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary of Commerce may, 
after October 1, 1998, implement a comprehensive management system 
pursuant to section 304 of such Act (16 U.S.C. 1854) for pelagic 
longline fishing vessels that participate in fisheries for Atlantic 
highly migratory species. Such a system may not implement an individual 
fishing quota program until after October 1, 2000.
    (i) Repeal or Revocation of a Fishery Management Plan.--Section 304, 
as amended, is further amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(h) Repeal or Revocation of a Fishery Management Plan.--The 
Secretary may repeal or revoke a fishery management plan for a fishery 
under the authority of a Council only if the Council approves the repeal 
or revocation by a three-quarters majority of the voting members of the 
Council.''.

        fishery negotiation panel to assist in the development of 
        specific conservation and management measures for a fishery 
        under its authority. The Secretary may establish a fishery 
        negotiation panel to assist in the development of specific 
        conservation and management measures required for a fishery 
        under section 304(e)(5), for a fishery for which the Secretary 
        has authority under section 304(g), or for any other fishery 
        with the approval of the appropriate Council.
            ``(B) <<NOTE: Regulations.>>  No later than 180 days after

        to October 1, 1995, the Council had not approved a percentage of

Management Council, for the purpose of establishing not less than three 
and not more than five fishery demonstration projects to foster and 
promote traditional indigenous fishing practices. The total amount of 
grants awarded under this subsection shall not exceed $500,000 in each 
fiscal year.

    (2) Demonstration projects funded pursuant to this subsection shall 
foster and promote the involvement of western Pacific communities in 
western Pacific fisheries and may--
            (A) identify and apply traditional indigenous fishing 
        practices;

SEC. 112. STATE JURISDICTION.

    (a) Paragraph (3) of section 306(a) (16 U.S.C. 1856(a)) is amended 
to read as follows:
            ``(3) A State may regulate a fishing vessel outside the 
        boundaries of the State in the following circumstances:
                    ``(A) The fishing vessel is registered under the law 
                of that State, and (i) there is no fishery management 
                plan or other applicable Federal fishing regulations for 
                the fishery in which the vessel is operating; or (ii) 
                the State's laws and regulations are consistent with the 
                fishery management plan and applicable Federal fishing 
                regulations for the fishery in which the vessel is 
                operating.
                    ``(B) The fishery management plan for the fishery in 
                which the fishing vessel is operating delegates 
                management of the fishery to a State and the State's 
                laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery 
                management plan. If <<NOTE: Notification.>> at any time 
                the Secretary determines that a State law or regulation 
                applicable to a fishing vessel under this circumstance 
                is not consistent with the fishery management plan, the 
                Secretary shall promptly notify the State and the 
                appropriate Council of such determination and provide an 
                opportunity for the State to correct any inconsistencies 
                identified in the notification. If, after notice and 
                opportunity for corrective action, the State does not 
                correct the inconsistencies identified by the Secretary, 
                the authority granted to the State under this 
                subparagraph shall not apply until the Secretary and the 
                appropriate Council find that the State has corrected 
                the inconsistencies. For a fishery for which there was a 
                fishery management plan in place on August 1, 1996 that 
                did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as 
                of that date, the authority provided by this 
                subparagraph applies only if the Council approves the 
                delegation of management of the fishery to the State by 
                a three-quarters majority vote of the voting members of 
                the Council.
                    ``(C) The fishing vessel is not registered under the 
                law of the State of Alaska and is operating in a fishery 
                in the exclusive economic zone off Alaska for which 
                there was no fishery management plan in place on August 
                1, 1996, and the Secretary and the North Pacific Council 
                find that there is a legitimate interest of the State of 
                Alaska in the conservation and management of such 
                fishery. <<NOTE: Termination date.>> The authority

fish harvesting and processing against any vessel operating in the 
exclusive economic zone off each respective State in a fishery for 
Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) for which there is no fishery 
management plan implemented under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).

            (3) With respect to the States of Washington, Oregon, and 
        California--
                    (A) any State law limiting entry to a fishery 
                subject to regulation under this subsection may not be 
                enforced against a vessel that is operating in the 
                exclusive economic zone off that State and is not 
                registered under the law of that State, if the vessel is 
                otherwise legally fishing in the exclusive economic 
                zone, except that State laws regulating landings may be 
                enforced; and

        whichever date is earlier.
            (5) Nothing in this subsection shall reduce the authority of 
        any State, as such authority existed on July 1, 1996, to 
        regulate fishing, fish processing, or landing of fish.
            (6)(A) It is the sense of Congress that the Pacific Fishery 
        Management Council, at the earliest practicable date, should 
        develop and submit to the Secretary fishery management plans for 
        shellfish fisheries conducted in the geographic area of 
        authority of the Council, especially Dungeness crab, which are 
        not subject to a fishery management plan on the date of 
        enactment of this Act.

fishing community, the Secretary shall determine whether there is a 
commercial fishery failure due to a fishery resource disaster as a 
result of--

        to mitigate through conservation and management measures; or

commercial fishery failure, the Secretary is authorized to make sums 
available to be used by the affected State, fishing community, or by the 
Secretary in cooperation with the affected State or fishing community 
for assessing the economic and social effects of the commercial fishery 
failure, or any activity that the Secretary determines is appropriate to 
restore the fishery or prevent a similar failure in the future and to 
assist a fishing community affected by such failure. Before making funds 
available for an activity authorized under this section, the Secretary 
shall make a determination that such activity will not expand the size 
or scope of the commercial fishery failure in that fishery or into other 
fisheries or other geographic regions.
    ``(3) The Federal share of the cost of any activity carried out 
under the authority of this subsection shall not exceed 75 percent of 
the cost of that activity.

    ``(b) Fishing Capacity Reduction Program.--(1) The Secretary, at the 
request of the appropriate Council for fisheries under the authority of 
such Council, or the Governor of a State for fisheries under State 
authority, may conduct a fishing capacity reduction program (referred to 
in this section as the `program') in a fishery if the Secretary 
determines that the program--
            ``(A) is necessary to prevent or end overfishing, rebuild 
        stocks of fish, or achieve measurable and significant 
        improvements in the conservation and management of the fishery;
            ``(B) is consistent with the Federal or State fishery 
        management plan or program in effect for such fishery, as 
        appropriate, and that the fishery management plan--

                capacity removed by the program through a moratorium on 
                new entrants, restrictions on vessel upgrades, and other 
                effort control measures, taking into account the full 
                potential fishing capacity of the fleet; and
                    ``(ii) establishes a specified or target total 
                allowable catch or other measures that trigger closure

        obligation incurred under section 1111 of title XI of the 
        Merchant Marine Act, 1936.

sustained reduction in fishing capacity at the least cost and in a 
minimum period of time. To achieve that objective, the Secretary is 
authorized to pay--

        scrapped, or (ii) through the Secretary of the department in 
        which the Coast Guard is operating, subjected to title 
        restrictions that permanently prohibit and effectively prevent 
        its use in fishing, and if the permit authorizing the 
        participation of the vessel in the fishery is surrendered for 
        permanent revocation and the owner relinquishes any claim 
        associated with the vessel and permit that could qualify such 
        owner for any present or future limited access system permit in 
        the fishery for which the program is established; or
            ``(B) the holder of a permit authorizing participation in 
        the fishery, if such permit is surrendered for permanent 
        revocation, and such holder relinquishes any claim associated 
        with the permit and vessel used to harvest fishery resources 
        under the permit that could qualify such holder for any present 
        or future limited access system permit in the fishery for which 
        the program was established.

Secretary shall ensure compliance by all who do participate.

necessary to fund the program, the Secretary, at the request of the 
appropriate Council, may conduct a referendum on such system. Prior to 
the referendum, the Secretary, in consultation with the Council, shall--
            ``(i) <<NOTE: Notification.>>  identify, to the extent 
        practicable, and notify all permit or vessel owners who would be 
        affected by the program; and

        eligibility requirements for the referendum, the proposed 
        program, and the amount and duration and any other terms and 
        conditions of the proposed fee system.

referendum votes which are cast in favor of the proposed system 
constitute a two-thirds majority of the participants voting.

industry fee system, the Secretary is authorized to establish such a 
system to fund the program and repay debt obligations incurred pursuant 
to section 1111 of title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936. The fees 
for a program established under this section shall--

        the proceeds otherwise payable to the seller and accounted for 
        and forwarded by such fish purchasers to the Secretary in such 
        manner as the Secretary may establish; and

        obligation has been fully paid.

    ``(e) Implementation Plan.--(1) <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
publication.>> The Secretary, in consultation with the appropriate 
Council or State and other interested parties, shall prepare and publish 
in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period an 
implementation plan, including proposed regulations, for each program. 
The implementation plan shall--

        vessels which are eligible for participation in the program 
        taking into account characteristics of the fishery, the 
        requirements of applicable fishery management plans, the needs 
        of fishing communities, and the need to minimize program costs;

            ``(B) establish procedures for program participation (such 
        as submission of owner bid under an auction system or fair 
        market-value assessment) including any terms and conditions for
