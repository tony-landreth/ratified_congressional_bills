SEC. 268. DESALTING TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Access to scarce fresh water is likely to be a cause of 
        future military conflicts in the Middle East and has a direct 
        impact on stability and security in the region.
            (2) The Middle East is an area of vital and strategic 
        importance to the United States.
            (3) The United States has played a military role in the 
        Middle East, most recently in the Persian Gulf War, and may 
        likely be called upon again to deter aggression in the region.
            (4) United States troops have used desalting technologies to 
        guarantee the availability of fresh water in past deployments in 
        the Middle East.
            (5) Adequate, efficient, and cheap access to high-quality 
        fresh water will be vital to maintaining the readiness and 
        sustainability of troops of both the United States and its 
        allies.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, as 
improved access to fresh water will be an important factor in helping 
prevent future conflicts in the Middle East, the United States should, 
in cooperation with its allies, promote and invest in technologies to 
reduce the costs of converting saline water into fresh water.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2469]]

    (c) Funding for Research and Development.--Of the amounts authorized 
to be appropriated by this title, the Secretary shall place greater 
emphasis on making funds available for research and development into 
efficient and economical processes and methods for converting saline 
water into fresh water.

whether such equipment would be the most appropriate equipment for use 
as a test bed for the military application of commercial off-the-shelf 
advanced technology linking multiple continents, multiple satellites, 
and multiple theaters of operations by compressed digital audio and 
visual broadcasting technology.
    (b) Report.--Not later than April 1, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the evaluation 
conducted under subsection (a).

         Subtitle E--National Oceanographic Partnership Program

SEC. 281. <<NOTE: 10 USC 7901 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The oceans and coastal areas of the United States are 
        among the Nation's most valuable natural resources, making 
        substantial contributions to economic growth, quality of life, 
        and national security.
            (2) Oceans drive global and regional climate. Hence, they 
        contain information affecting agriculture, fishing, and the 
        prediction of severe weather.
            (3) Understanding of the oceans through basic and applied 
        research is essential for using the oceans wisely and protecting 
        their limited resources. Therefore, the United States should 
        maintain its world leadership in oceanography as one key to its 
        competitive future.
            (4) Ocean research and education activities take place 
        within Federal agencies, academic institutions, and industry. 
        These entities often have similar requirements for research 
        facilities, data, and other resources (such as oceanographic 
        research vessels).
            (5) The need exists for a formal mechanism to coordinate 
        existing partnerships and establish new partnerships for the 
        sharing of resources, intellectual talent, and facilities in the

[[Page 110 STAT. 2470]]

        ocean sciences and education, so that optimal use can be made of 
        this most important natural resource for the well-being of all 
        Americans.

SEC. 546. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORT REGARDING REEMPLOYMENT 
                        RIGHTS FOR MOBILIZED RESERVISTS EMPLOYED 
                        IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress is concerned about the lack of 
reemployment rights afforded Reserve component members who reside in 
foreign countries and either work for United States companies that 
maintain offices or operations in foreign countries or work for foreign 
employers. Being outside the jurisdiction of the United States, these 
employers are not subject to the provisions of chapter 43 of title 38, 
United States Code, known as the Uniformed Services Employment and 
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). The purpose of that Act is to provide 
statutory employment protections that include reinstatement, seniority, 
status, and rate of pay coverage for Reservists who are ordered to 
active duty for a specified period of time, including involuntary active 
duty in support of an operational contingency. While most Reserve 
members are afforded the protections of that Act (which covers 
reemployment rights in their civilian jobs upon completion of military 
service), approximately 2,000 members of the Selected Reserve reside 
outside the United States and its territories and, not being guaranteed 
the job protection envisioned by the USERRA, are potentially subject to 
reemployment problems after release from active duty. This situation 
poses a continuing personnel management challenge for the reserve 
components.
    (b) Recognition of Problem.--Congress, while recognizing that 
foreign governments and companies located abroad, not being within the 
jurisdiction of the United States, cannot be required to comply with the 
provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights 
Act, also recognizes that there is a need to provide assistance to 
Reservists in the situation described in subsection (a), both in the 
near term and the long term.
    (c) Report Requirement.--Not later than April 1, 1997, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate 
and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a 
report that sets forth recommended actions to help alleviate 
reemployment problems for Reservists who are employed outside the United 
States and its territories by United States companies that maintain 
offices or operations in foreign countries or by foreign employers. The 
report shall include recommendations on the assistance and support that 
may be required by other organizations of the Government, including the 
Defense Attache Offices, the Department of Labor, and the Department of 
State. The report shall be prepared in consultation with the Secretary 
of State and the Secretary of Labor.
SEC. 547. PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS UNDER MOBILIZATION INCOME INSURANCE

    Section 12527(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``of the Selected 
        Reserve'' after ``a member''; and

[[Page 110 STAT. 2525]]

            (2) by striking out paragraph (2) and inserting in lieu 
        thereof the following:

    ``(2) <<NOTE: Regulations.>>  The Secretary of Defense, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall prescribe

members of the Individual Ready Reserve and other members who do not 
receive pay on a monthly basis.''.

        before age 55.--An annuity for a surviving spouse or former 
        spouse shall be paid to the surviving spouse or former spouse

        the reduction in the retired pay required to provide that 
        recalculated annuity shall be computed under section 1452 of 
        this title, and the difference between the amount deducted 
        before the computation of that recalculated annuity and the 
        amount that would have been deducted on the basis of that

administering Secretaries may not disenroll such an enrollee unless the 
disenrollment is agreed to by the Secretary and the designated provider.
    (d) Additional Enrollment Authority.--Other covered beneficiaries 
may also receive health care services from a designated provider, except

upon by the Secretary and the designated provider. In addition to such 
other factors as the parties may agree to apply, the capitation payments 
shall be based on the utilization experience of enrollees and 
competitive market rates for equivalent health care services for a 
comparable population to such enrollees in the area in which the 
designated provider is located.
    (b) Limitation on Total Payments.--Total capitation payments for 
health care services to a designated provider shall not exceed an amount

treatment facility, the TRICARE program, or the Medicare program, as the 
case may be.
    (c) Establishment of Payment Rates on Annual Basis.--The Secretary 
and a designated provider shall establish capitation payments on an 
annual basis, subject to periodic review for actuarial soundness and to 
adjustment for any adverse or favorable selection reasonably anticipated 
to result from the design of the program under this subtitle.

    Subtitle B--Force <<NOTE: Military Force Structure Review Act of 
1996. 10 USC 111 note.>> Structure Review

SEC. 921. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Military Force Structure Review 
Act of 1996''.

SEC. 922. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 
        United States has conducted two substantial assessments of the 
        force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet United 
        States defense requirements.
            (2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the 
        ``Base Force'' assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton 
        Administration (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were intended 
        to reassess the force structure of the Armed

[[Page 110 STAT. 2624]]

        Forces in light of the changing realities of the post-Cold War 
        world.
            (3) Both assessments served an important purpose in focusing 
        attention on the need to reevaluate the military posture of the 
        United States, but the pace of global change necessitates a new, 
        comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy of the United 
        States and the force structure of the Armed Forces required to 
        meet the threats to the United States in the twenty-first 
        century.
            (4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several 
        points, including--
                    (A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of 
                planning to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major 
                regional conflicts;
                    (B) the force levels recommended to carry out that 
                strategy; and
                    (C) the funding proposed for such recommended force 
                levels.
            (5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on 
        Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of Defense 
        endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial review of the 
        defense program at the beginning of each newly elected 
        Presidential administration, and the Department intends to 
        complete the first such review in 1997.
            (6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of 
        defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, and 
        reserve components, force modernization plans, infrastructure, 
        and other elements of the defense program and policies in order 
        to determine and express the defense
strategy of the United States and to establish a revised defense program 
through the year 2005.
            (7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the Armed 
        Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the national 
        security interests of the United States in the twenty-first 
        century, to assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the 
        review referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the 
        appropriate force structure of the Armed Forces through the year 
        2010 and beyond (if practicable), it is important to provide for 
        the conduct of an independent, nonpartisan review of the force 
        structure that is more comprehensive than prior assessments of 
        the force structure, extends beyond the quadrennial defense 
        review, and explores innovative and forward-thinking ways of 
        meeting such challenges.

SEC. 923. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.

    (a) Requirement in 1997.--The Secretary of Defense, in consultation 
with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall complete in 1997 a 
review of the defense program of the United States intended to satisfy 
the requirements for a Quadrennial Defense Review as identified in the 
recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed 
Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive examination of the 
defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, 
infrastructure, budget plan, and other elements of the defense program 
and policies with a view toward determining and expressing the defense 
strategy of the United States and establishing a revised defense program 
through the year 2005.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2625]]

    (b) Involvement of National Defense Panel.--(1) The Secretary shall

matters to be covered in the review.
    (c) Assessments of Review.--Upon completion of the review, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of the National 
Defense Panel, on behalf of the Panel, shall each prepare and submit to 
the Secretary such Chairman's assessment of the review in time for the 
inclusion of the assessment in its entirety in the report under 
subsection (d).
    (d) Report.--Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary shall submit 
to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on 
National Security of the House of Representatives a comprehensive report 
on the review. The report shall include the following:
            (1) The results of the review, including a comprehensive 
        discussion of the defense strategy of the United States and the 
        force structure best suited to implement that strategy.

        scenarios developed in the examination of such threats.
            (3) The assumptions used in the review, including 
        assumptions relating to the cooperation of allies and mission-
        sharing, levels of acceptable risk, warning times, and intensity 
        and duration of conflict.
            (4) The effect on the force structure of preparations for 
        and participation in peace operations and military operations 
        other than war.
            (5) The effect on the force structure of the utilization by 
        the Armed Forces of technologies anticipated to be available by 
        the year 2005, including precision guided munitions, stealth, 
        night vision, digitization, and communications, and the changes 
        in doctrine and operational concepts that would result from the 
        utilization of such technologies.
            (6) The manpower and sustainment policies required under the 
        defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts lasting more 
        than 120 days.
            (7) The anticipated roles and missions of the reserve 
        components in the defense strategy and the strength, 
        capabilities, and equipment necessary to assure that the reserve 
        components can capably discharge those roles and missions.
            (8) The appropriate ratio of combat forces to support forces 
        (commonly referred to as the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio) under the 
        defense strategy, including, in particular, the appropriate 
        number and size of headquarter units and Defense Agencies for 
        that purpose.
            (9) The air-lift and sea-lift capabilities required to 
        support the defense strategy.
            (10) The forward presence, pre-positioning, and other 
        anticipatory deployments necessary under the defense strategy 
        for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to 
        anticipated conflicts.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2626]]

            (11) The extent to which resources must be shifted among two 
        or more theaters under the defense strategy in the event of 
        conflict in such theaters.
            (12) The advisability of revisions to the Unified Command

    (b) Membership.--The Panel shall be composed of a chairman and eight 
other individuals appointed by the Secretary, in consultation with the 
chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on National 
Security of the House of Representatives, from among individuals in the 
private sector who are recognized experts in matters relating to the 
national security of the United States.
    (c) Duties.--The Panel shall--
            (1) conduct and submit to the Secretary the assessment of 
        the review under section 923 that is required by subsection 
        (b)(2) of that section;
            (2) conduct and submit to the Secretary the comprehensive

        for the Armed Forces required under subsection (d).

    (d) Alternative Force Structure Assessment.--(1) The Panel shall 
submit to the Secretary an independent assessment of a variety of 
possible force structures of the Armed Forces through the year 2010 and 
beyond, including the force structure identified in the report on the 
review under section 923(d). The purpose of the assessment is to develop 
proposals for an ``above the line'' force structure of the Armed Forces 
and to provide the Secretary and Congress recommendations regarding the 
optimal force structure to meet anticipated threats to the national 
security of the United States through the time covered by the 
assessment.
    (2) In conducting the assessment, the Panel shall examine a variety 
of potential threats (including near-term threats and long-term threats) 
to the national security interests of the United States, including the 
following:
            (A) Conventional threats across a spectrum of conflicts.
            (B) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the 
        means of delivering such weapons, and the illicit transfer of 
        technology relating to such weapons.

            (B) Scenarios developed in light of a continuum of conflicts 
        ranging from a conflict of lesser magnitude than the conflict 
        described in the Bottom-Up Review to a conflict of greater 
        magnitude than the conflict so described.

    (4) As part of the assessment, the Panel shall also--
            (A) develop recommendations regarding a variety of force 
        structures for the Armed Forces that permit the forward 
        deployment of sufficient air, land, and sea-based forces to 
        provide an effective deterrent to conflict and to permit a 
        military response by the United States to the scenarios 
        developed under paragraph (3);
            (B) to the extent practicable, estimate the funding required 
        by fiscal year, in constant fiscal year 1997 dollars, to

                states; and
                    (D) changes in defense budget projections.
            (2) The manner in which the processes described in paragraph 
        (1) are harmonized to ensure that there is a sufficient 
        consideration of the development of joint doctrine, operational 
        concepts, and acquisition strategies.
            (3) The manner in which the processes described in paragraph

        Council and reflected in the planning, programming, and 
        budgeting process of the Department of Defense.
SEC. 1043. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY CHILD CARE 
                          PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense should be congratulated on the 
        successful implementation of the Military Child Care Act of 1989 
        (originally enacted as title XV of Public Law 101-189 and 
        subsequently codified as subchapter II of chapter 88 of title 
        10, United States Code).
            (2) The actions taken by the Department as a result of that 
        Act have dramatically improved the availability, affordability, 
        quality, and consistency of the child-care services provided to 
        members of the Armed Forces.
            (3) Child care is important to the readiness of members of 
        the Armed Forces since single parents and couples in military 
        service must have access to affordable child care of good 
        quality

[[Page 110 STAT. 2643]]

        if they are to perform their jobs and respond effectively to 
        long work hours or deployments.
            (4) Child care is important to the retention of members of 
        the Armed Forces in military service because the dissatisfaction 
        of the families of such members with military life is a primary 
        reason for the departure of such members from military service.

    (b) Sense of Congress Related to Military-Civilian Child-Care 
Partnership Programs.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the civilian and military child-care communities, 
        Federal, State, and local agencies, and businesses and 
        communities involved in the provision of child-care services 
        could benefit from the development of partnerships to foster an 
        exchange of ideas, information, and materials relating to their 
        experiences with the provision of such services and to encourage 
        closer relationships between military installations and the 
        communities that support them;
            (2) such partnerships would be beneficial to all families by 
        helping providers of child-care services exchange ideas about 
        innovative ways to address barriers to the effective provision 
        of such services; and
            (3) there are many ways that such partnerships could be 
        developed, including--
                    (A) cooperation between the directors and curriculum 
                specialists of military child development centers and 
                civilian child development centers in assisting such 
                centers in the accreditation process;
                    (B) use of family support staff to conduct parent 
                and family workshops for new parents and parents with 
                young children in family housing on military 
                installations and in communities in the vicinity of such 
                installations;
                    (C) internships in Department of Defense child-care 
                programs for civilian child-care providers to broaden 
                the base of good-quality child-care services in 
                communities in the vicinity of military installations; 
                and
                    (D) attendance by civilian child-care providers at 
                Department child-care training classes on a space-
                available basis.

    (c) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the status of any partnerships and 
other initiatives undertaken by the Department of Defense as described 
in subsection (b), including recommendations for additional ways to 
improve the child-care programs of the Department of Defense and to 
improve such programs so as to benefit civilian child-care providers in 
communities in the vicinity of military installations.
SEC. 1044. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MILITARY YOUTH 
                          PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Programs of the Department of Defense for youth who are 
        dependents of members of the Armed Forces have not received the 
        same level of attention and resources as have child-care 
        programs of the Department since the passage of the Military 
        Child Care Act of 1989 (originally enacted as title XV of Public 
        Law 101-189 and subsequently codified as subchapter II of 
        chapter 88 of title 10, United States Code).

[[Page 110 STAT. 2644]]

            (2) Older children deserve as much attention to their 
        developmental needs as do younger children.
            (3) The Department has started to direct more attention to 
        programs for youths who are dependents of members of the Armed 
        Forces by providing funds for the implementation of 20 model 
        community programs to address the needs of such youths.
            (4) The lessons learned from such programs could apply to 
        civilian youth programs as well.

    (b) Sense of Congress Related to Military-Civilian Youth Partnership 
Programs.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense, Federal, State, and local 
        agencies, and businesses and communities involved in conducting 
        youth programs could benefit from the development of 
        partnerships to foster an exchange of ideas, information, and 
        materials relating to such programs and to encourage closer 
        relationships between military installations and the communities 
        that support them;
            (2) such partnerships could be beneficial to all families by 
        helping the providers of services for youths exchange ideas 
        about innovative ways to address barriers to the effective 
        provision of such services; and
            (3) there are many ways that such partnerships could be 
        developed, including--
                    (A) cooperation between the Department and Federal 
                and State educational agencies in exploring the use of 
                public school facilities for child-care programs and 
                youth programs that are mutually beneficial to the 
                Department and civilian communities and complement 
                programs of the Department carried out at its 
                facilities; and
                    (B) improving youth programs that enable adolescents 
                to relate to new peer groups when families of members of 
                the Armed Forces are relocated.

    (c) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the status of any partnerships and 
other initiatives undertaken by the Department as described in 
subsection (b), including recommendations for additional ways to improve 
the youth programs of the Department of Defense and to improve such 
programs so as to benefit communities in the vicinity of military 
installations.

        ports or overflight rights, including the following:
                    (A) Force units that are routinely deployed forward 
                at sea or on land outside the United States.

        forces, that can be mobilized and deployed to a theater within 
        approximately 180 days after receipt of orders.
            (4) All other active and reserve component force units which 
        are not categorized within a classification described in 
        paragraph (1), (2), or (3).

    ``(a) Prompt Indemnification Required.--(1) In the event of a loss 
that is covered by vessel war risk insurance, the Secretary of Defense 
shall promptly indemnify the Secretary of Transportation for the amount 
of the loss consistent with the indemnification agreement between the 
two Secretaries that underlies such insurance. The Secretary of Defense 
shall make such indemnification--
            ``(A) in the case of a claim for the loss of a vessel, not 
        later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary of 
        Transportation determines the claim to be payable or that 
        amounts are due under the policy that provided the vessel war 
        risk insurance; and
            ``(B) in the case of any other claim, not later than 180 
        days after the date on which on which the Secretary of 
        Transportation determines the claim to be payable.

    ``(2) When there is a loss of a vessel that is (or may be) covered 
by vessel war risk insurance, the Secretary of Transportation may make, 
during the period when a claim for such loss is pending with the 
Secretary of Transportation, any required periodic payments owed by the 
insured party to a lessor or mortgagee of such vessel. Such payments 
shall commence not later than 30 days following the date of the 
presentment of the claim for the loss of the vessel to the Secretary of 
Transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the 
claim is payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from such 
claim shall be credited against the amount payable under the vessel war 
risk insurance. If the Secretary of Transportation determines that the 
claim is not payable, any amount paid under this paragraph arising from 
such claim shall constitute a debt to the United States, payable to the 
insurance fund. Any such amounts so returned to the United States shall 
be promptly credited to the fund or account from which the payments were 
made under this paragraph.
    ``(b) Source of Funds for Payment of Indemnity.--The Secretary of 
Defense may pay an indemnity described in subsection (a) from any funds 
available to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance, 
and such sums as may be necessary for payment of such indemnity are 
hereby authorized to be transferred to the Secretary of Transportation 
for such purpose.
    ``(c) Deposit of Funds.--Any amount transferred to the Secretary of 
Transportation under this section shall be deposited in, and merged with 
amounts in, the Vessel War Risk Insurance Fund as provided in the second 
sentence of section 1208(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C. 
App. 1288(a)).
    ``(d) Notice to Congress.--In the event of a loss that is covered by 
vessel war risk insurance in the case of an incident in which the 
covered loss is (or is expected to be) in an amount in excess of 
$1,000,000, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress--

        updating the information submitted under paragraph (1) and 
        showing with respect to losses arising from such incident the 
        total amount expended to cover such losses, the source of such 
        funds, pending litigation, and estimated total cost to the 
        Government.

    ``(e) Implementing Matters.--(1) Payment of indemnification under 
this section is not subject to section 2214 or
2215 of this title or any other provision of law requiring notification 
to Congress before funds may be transferred.

    ``(2) Consolidation of claims arising from the same incident is not 
required before indemnification of the Secretary of Transportation for 
payment of a claim may be made under this section.
    ``(f) Construction With Other Transfer Authority.--Authority to 
transfer funds under this section is in addition to any other authority 
provided by law to transfer funds (whether enacted before, on, or after

1281 et seq.).
    ``(h) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Vessel war risk insurance.--The term `vessel war risk 
        insurance' means insurance and reinsurance provided through 
        policies issued by the Secretary of Transportation under title 
        XII of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C. App. 1281 et 
        seq.), that is provided by that Secretary without premium at the 
        request of the Secretary of Defense and is covered by an 
        indemnity agreement between the Secretary of Transportation and

SEC. 1081. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE 
                          AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND 
                          JAPAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) <<NOTE: William J. Clinton. Ryutaro Hashimoto.>> The 
        United States and Japan share a long and important bilateral 
        relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and stability in 
        the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was reaffirmed at the 
        recent summit meeting between President Clinton and Prime 
        Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.
            (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over the 
        past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer possible for 
        Japan, the world's second largest economy, to use exports as the 
        sole engine of economic growth, but that the Government of Japan 
        must promote deregulation of its domestic economy in order to 
        increase economic growth.
            (3) Deregulation of the Japanese economy requires 
        government attention to the removal of barriers to imports of 
        manufactured goods.
            (4) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade 
        Agreement has begun the process of deregulation in the 
        semiconductor sector and is opening the Japanese market to 
        competitive foreign products.
            (5) The United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement 
        has put in place both government-to-government and industry-to-
        industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in allowing 
        cooperation to replace conflict in this important high 
        technology sector.
            (6) The mechanisms include joint calculation of foreign 
        market share, deterrence of dumping, and promotion of industrial 
        cooperation in the design of foreign semiconductor devices.
            (7) Because of these actions under the United States-Japan 
        Semiconductor Trade Agreement, the United States and Japan today 
        enjoy trade in semiconductors which is mutually beneficial, 
        harmonious, and free from the friction that once characterized 
        the semiconductor industry.
            (8) Because of structural barriers in Japan, a gap still 
        remains between the share of the world market for semiconductor 
        products outside Japan that the United States and other foreign 
        semiconductor sources are able to capture through 
        competitiveness and the share of the Japanese semiconductor 
        market that the United States and those other sources are able 
        to capture through competitiveness, and that gap is consistent 
        across the full range of semiconductor products as well as a 
        full range of end-use applications.
            (9) The competitiveness and health of the United States 
        semiconductor industry is of critical importance to the overall

[[Page 110 STAT. 2672]]

        economic well-being and high-technology defense capabilities of 
        the United States.
            (10) The economic interests of both the United States and 
        Japan are best served by well functioning, open markets, 
        deterrence of dumping, and continuing good cooperative 
        relationships in all sectors, including semiconductors.
            (11) A strong and healthy military and political alliance 
        between the United States and Japan requires continuation of the 
        industrial and economic cooperation promoted by the United 
        States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement.
            (12) President Clinton has called on the Government of Japan 
        to agree to a continuation of the United States-Japan 
        Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond the current agreement's 
        expiration on July 31, 1996.
            (13) The Government of Japan has opposed any 
        continuation of the United States-Japan Semiconductor Trade 
        Agreement to promote cooperation in United States-Japan 
        semiconductor trade.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--On the basis of the findings contained in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is regrettable that the Government of Japan has 
        refused to consider continuation of the United States-Japan 
        Semiconductor Trade Agreement to ensure that cooperation 
        continues in the semiconductor sector beyond the expiration of 
        the agreement on July 31, 1996; and
            (2) the President should take all necessary and appropriate 
        actions to ensure the resumption and extension of the United 
        States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement beyond July 31, 1996.

    (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``United 
States-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement'' refers to the agreement 
between the United States and Japan concerning trade in semiconductor 
products, with arrangement, done by exchange of letters at Washington on 
June 11, 1991.

        of the assignments of the exchanged personnel.
            (C) Costs incident to the use of the facilities of the host 
        government in the performance of assigned duties.

    (e) Prohibited Conditions.--No personnel exchanged pursuant to an 
agreement under this section may take or be required to take an oath of 
allegiance to the host country or to hold an official capacity in the

    This title may be cited as the ``National Imagery and Mapping Agency 
Act of 1996''.

SEC. 1102. <<NOTE: 10 USC 441 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There is a need within the Department of Defense and the 
        Intelligence Community of the United States to provide a single 
        agency focus for the growing number and diverse types of 
        customers for imagery and geospatial information resources 
        within the Government, to ensure visibility and accountability 
        for those resources, and to harness, leverage, and focus rapid 
        technological developments to serve the imagery, imagery 
        intelligence, and geospatial information customers.
            (2) There is a need for a single Government agency to 
        solicit and advocate the needs of that growing and diverse pool 
        of customers.
            (3) A single combat support agency dedicated to imagery, 
        imagery intelligence, and geospatial information could act as a 
        focal point for support of all imagery intelligence and 
        geospatial information customers, including customers in the 
        Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and related 
        agencies outside of the Department of Defense.
            (4) Such an agency would best serve the needs of the 
        imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information 
        customers if it were organized--
                    (A) to carry out its mission responsibilities under 
                the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary 
                of Defense, with the advice of the Chairman of the Joint 
                Chiefs of Staff; and
                    (B) to carry out its responsibilities to national 
                intelligence customers in accordance with policies and 
                priorities established by the Director of Central 
                Intelligence.

SEC. 1103. ROLE OF DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE IN APPOINTMENT AND 
            EVALUATION OF CERTAIN INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS.

    (a) In General.--Section 201 of title 10, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 201. Certain intelligence officials: consultation and 
                  concurrence regarding appointments; evaluation 
                  of performance

        additional general and flag officers in the commands and offices 
        created by sections 1211 and 1212.

    (b) Matters To Be Included.--The Secretary shall include in the 
report under subsection (a) the Secretary's views on whether current 
limitations referred to in subsection (a)--
            (1) permit the Secretaries of the military departments, in 
        view of increased requirements for assignment of general and 
        flag officers in positions external to their organic services, 
        to meet adequately both internal and external requirements for

            (A) the effective management of those Reserve general and 
        flag officers; and
            (B) revision of active duty ceilings so as to prevent an 
        increase in the numbers of active general and flag officers 
        authorizations due solely to the removal of Reserve general and 
        flag officers from under the active duty authorizations.

    (3) If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that active and 
reserve general officers on active duty should continue to be managed 
under a common ceiling, the Secretary shall make recommendations for the

        perform the mission being performed by the reserve component 
        unit;

        deactivations to occur under the agreement will be carried out 
        in a symmetrical, reciprocal, or equivalent manner.
            (E) An assessment by the President of the effect of the 
        proposed early deactivation on the stability of the strategic 
        balance and relative strategic nuclear capabilities of the 
        United States and the Russian Federation at various stages 
        during deactivation and upon completion.

                agreement for cooperation concerning the civil use of 
                nuclear energy with the United States materially 
                violates, abrogates, or terminates, after October 26, 
                1977, any guarantee or other undertaking to the United 
                States made in such agreement;

                to acquire any such nuclear explosive device or to 
                acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material,
        then the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the 
        appropriate committees of the Congress and to the Board of 
        Directors of the Bank stating such determination and identifying 
        each country or person the Secretary determines has so acted.
            ``(B)(i) If the Secretary of State makes a determination 
        under subparagraph (A)(v) with respect to a foreign person, the 
        Congress urges the Secretary to initiate consultations 
        immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction over

        that person with respect to the imposition of the prohibition 
        contained in subparagraph (C).
            ``(ii) In order that consultations with that government may 
        be pursued, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall delay 
        imposition of the prohibition contained in subparagraph (C) for 
        up to 90 days if the Secretary of State requests the Board to 
        make such delay. Following these consultations, the prohibition 
        contained in subparagraph (C) shall apply immediately unless the 
        Secretary determines and certifies to the Congress that that

        appropriate penalties, to terminate the involvement of the 
        foreign person in the activities described in subparagraph 
        (A)(v). The Board of Directors of the Bank shall delay the 
        imposition of the prohibition contained in subparagraph (C) for 
        up to an additional 90 days if the Secretary requests the Board 
        to make such additional delay and if the Secretary determines 
        and certifies to the Congress that that government is in the 
        process of taking the actions described in the preceding 
        sentence.
            ``(iii) <<NOTE: Reports.>> Not later than 90 days after 
        making a determination under subparagraph (A)(v), the Secretary 
        of State shall submit to the appropriate committees of the

        appropriate government under this subparagraph, and the basis 
        for any determination under clause (ii) that such government has 
        taken specific corrective actions.

SEC. 1305. REPORT ON MILITARY CAPABILITIES OF PEOPLE'S 
                          REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    (a) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall prepare a report, in 
both classified and unclassified form, on the future pattern of military 
modernization of the People's Republic of China. The report shall 
address both the probable course of military-technological development 
in the People's Liberation Army and the 
development of Chinese military strategy and operational concepts.
    (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report shall include analyses and 
forecasts of the following:
            (1) Trends that would lead the People's Republic of China 
        toward advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
        capabilities, either through a development program or by gaining 
        access to commercial or third-party systems with militarily 
        significant capabilities.
            (2) Efforts by the People's Republic of China to develop 
        highly accurate and low-observable ballistic and cruise 
        missiles, and the investments in infrastructure that would allow 
        for production of such weapons in militarily significant 
        quantities, particularly in numbers sufficient to conduct 
        attacks capable of overwhelming projected defense capabilities 
        in the region.
            (3) Development by the People's Republic of China of 
        enhanced command and control networks, particularly those 
        capable of battle management that would include long-range 
        precision strikes.
            (4) Programs of the People's Republic of China involving 
        unmanned aerial vehicles, particularly those with extended 
        ranges or loitering times.
            (5) Exploitation by the People's Republic of China of the 
        Global Positioning System or other similar systems, including 
        commercial land surveillance satellites, for significant 
        military purposes, including particularly for increasing the 
        accuracy of weapons or the situational awareness of operating 
        forces.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2706]]

            (6) Development by the People's Republic of China of 
        capabilities for denial of sea control, such as advanced sea 
        mines or improved submarine capabilities.
            (7) Continued development by the People's Republic of China 
        of follow-on forces, particularly those capable of rapid air or 
        amphibious assault.

    (c) Submission of Report.--The report shall be submitted to Congress 
not later than February 1, 1997.
SEC. 1306. PRESIDENTIAL REPORT REGARDING WEAPONS PROLIFERATION AND 
                          POLICIES OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
                          CHINA.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the People's Republic of China acceded to the Treaty on 
        the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (hereafter in this 
        section referred to as the ``NPT'') on March 9, 1992;
            (2) the People's Republic of China is not a member of the 
        Nuclear Suppliers Group and remains the only major nuclear 
        supplier that continues to transfer nuclear technology, 
        equipment, and materials to countries that have not agreed to 
        the application of safeguards of the International Atomic Energy 
        Agency (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``IAEA'') 
        over all of their nuclear materials;
            (3) on June 30, 1995, the United States and 29 other members 
        of the Nuclear Suppliers Group notified the Director General of 
        the IAEA that the Government of each respective country has 
        decided that the controls of that
Group should not be defeated by the transfer of component parts;
            (4) a state-owned entity in the People's Republic of China, 
        the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, has knowingly 
        transferred specially designed ring magnets to an unsafeguarded 
        uranium enrichment facility in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan;
            (5) ring magnets are identified on the Trigger List of the 
        Nuclear Suppliers Group as a component of magnetic suspension 
        bearings which are to be exported only to countries that have 
        safeguards of the IAEA over all of their nuclear materials;
            (6) these ring magnets could contribute significantly to the 
        ability of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to produce 
        additional unsafeguarded enriched uranium, a nuclear explosive 
        material;
            (7) the Government of the People's Republic of China has 
        transferred nuclear equipment and technology to the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran, despite repeated claims by the Government of 
        the United States that the Islamic Republic of Iran is engaged 
        in clandestine efforts to acquire a nuclear explosive device;
            (8) representatives of the Government of the People's 
        Republic of China have repeatedly assured the Government of the 
        United States that the People's Republic of China would abide by 
        the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime 
        (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``MTCR'');
            (9) the Government of China has transferred M-11 missiles to 
        the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; and
            (10) the M-11 missile conforms to the definition of a 
        nuclear-capable missile under the MTCR.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the 
Congress that--

[[Page 110 STAT. 2707]]

            (1) the assistance that the People's Republic of China has 
        provided to the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the Islamic 
        Republic of Pakistan could contribute to the ability of such 
        countries to manufacture nuclear weapons;
            (2) the recent transfer by the People's Republic of China of 
        ring magnets to an unsafeguarded uranium enrichment facility in 
        the Islamic Republic of Pakistan conflicts with China's 
        obligations under Articles I and III of the NPT, as well as the 
        official nonproliferation policies and assurances by the 
        People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 
        with respect to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
        nuclear-capable missiles;
            (3) the transfer of M-11 missiles from the People's Republic 
        of China to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is inconsistent 
        with longstanding United States Government interpretations of 
        assurances from the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        with respect to that country's intent to abide by the guidelines 
        of the MTCR;
            (4) violations by the People's Republic of China of the 
        standards and objectives of the MTCR and global nuclear 
        nonproliferation regimes have jeopardized the credibility of the 
        MTCR and such regimes;
            (5) the MTCR and global nuclear nonproliferation regimes 
        require collective international action to impose costs against 
        and to withhold benefits from any country, including the 
        People's Republic of China, that engages in activities that are 
        contrary to the objectives of those regimes;
            (6) the President should explore with the governments of 
        other countries new opportunities for collective action in

        the stability and growth of future relations between the people, 
        the economies, and the Governments of the United States and the 
        People's Republic of China will

        assurances and clarifications provided by the People's Republic 
        of China to have provided sufficient information to allow the 
        United States to determine that the People's Republic of China 
        is not in violation of paragraph (2) of section 129 of the 
        Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as required by Public Law 99-183.

487) is received by Congress.

SEC. 1308. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING EXPORT CONTROLS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 110 STAT. 2709]]

            (1) Export controls are a part of a comprehensive response 
        to national security threats. The export of a United States 
        commodity or technology should be restricted in cases in which 
        the export of the commodity or technology would increase the 
        threat to the national security of the United States or would be 
        contrary to the nonproliferation goals or foreign policy 
        interests of the United States.
            (2) The export of certain commodities and technology may 
        adversely affect the national security and foreign policy of the 
        United States by making a significant contribution to the 
        military potential of countries or by enhancing the capability 
        of countries to design, develop, test, produce, stockpile, or 
        use weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems, 
        and other significant military capabilities. Therefore, the 
        administration of export controls should emphasize the control 
        of these exports.
            (3) The acquisition of sensitive commodities and 
        technologies by those countries and end users whose actions or 
        policies run counter to United States national security or 
        foreign policy interests may enhance the military capabilities 
        of those countries, particularly their ability to design, 
        develop, test, produce, stockpile, use, and deliver nuclear, 
        chemical, and biological weapons and missile delivery systems, 
        and other significant military capabilities. This enhancement 
        threatens the security of the United States and its allies. The 
        availability to countries and end users of items that contribute 
        to military capabilities or the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction is a fundamental concern of the United States and 
        should be eliminated through deterrence, negotiations, and other 
        appropriate means whenever possible.
            (4) The national security of the United States depends not 
        only on wise foreign policies and a strong defense, but also a 
        vibrant national economy. To be truly effective, export controls 
        should be applied uniformly by all suppliers.
            (5) On November 8, 1995, the President continued the 
        national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12938 of 
        November 14, 1994, ``with respect to the unusual and 
        extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, 
        and 
        economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of 
        nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of 
        delivering such weapons''.
            (6) A successor regime to COCOM (the Coordinating Committee 
        for Multilateral Export Controls) has not been established. 
        Currently, each nation is determining independently which dual-
        use military items, if any, will be controlled for export.
            (7) The United States should play a leading role in 
        promoting transparency and responsibility with regard to the 
        transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) establishing an international export control regime, 
        empowered to control exports of dual-use technology, is 
        critically important and should be a top priority for the United 
        States; and
            (2) the United States should strongly encourage its allies 
        and other friendly countries to--

[[Page 110 STAT. 2710]]

                    (A) adopt export controls that are the same or 
                similar to the export controls imposed by the United 
                States on items on the Commerce Control List;
                    (B) strengthen enforcement of their export 
                controls; and
                    (C) explore the use of unilateral export controls 
                where the possibility exists that an export could 
                contribute to the enhancement of military capabilities 
                or
proliferation described in paragraphs (3) and (5) of subsection (a).

Section 1503 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
1995 (22 U.S.C. 2751 note) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) by striking out ``Report Required.--(1) Not 
                later than May 1, 1995 and May 1, 1996, the Secretary'' 
                and inserting in lieu thereof ``Annual Report 
                Required.--Not later than May 1 of each year, the 
                Secretary''; and
                    (B) by striking out paragraph (2); and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:

    ``(d) Review Committee Charter Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term `Review Committee charter' means section 1605 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (22 U.S.C. 2751 
note).
    ``(e) Termination of Requirement.--The final report required under 
subsection (a) is the report for the year following the year in which 
the Counterproliferation Program Review Committee established under the 
Review Committee Charter ceases to exist.''.
SEC. 1310. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ASSISTING OTHER COUNTRIES 
                          TO IMPROVE SECURITY OF FISSILE 
                          MATERIAL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) With the end of the Cold War, the world is faced with 
        the need to manage the dismantling of vast numbers of nuclear 
        weapons and the disposition of the fissile materials that they 
        contain.
            (2) If recently agreed reductions in nuclear weapons are 
        fully implemented, tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, 
        containing a hundred tons or more of plutonium and many hundreds 
        of tons of highly enriched uranium, will no longer be needed for 
        military purposes.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2711]]

            (3) Plutonium and highly enriched uranium are the essential 
        ingredients of nuclear weapons.
            (4) Limits on access to plutonium and highly enriched 
        uranium are the primary technical barrier to acquiring nuclear 
        weapons capability in the world today.
            (5) Several kilograms of plutonium, or several times that 
        amount of highly enriched uranium, are sufficient to make a 
        nuclear weapon.
            (6) Plutonium and highly enriched uranium will continue to 
        pose a potential threat for as long as they exist.
            (7) Action is required to secure and account for plutonium 
        and highly enriched uranium.
            (8) It is in the national interest of the United States to--
                    (A) minimize the risk that fissile materials could 
                be obtained by unauthorized parties;
                    (B) minimize the risk that fissile materials could 
                be reintroduced into the arsenals from which they came, 
                halting or reversing the arms reduction process; and
                    (C) strengthen the national and international 
                control mechanisms and incentives designed to ensure 
                continued arms reductions and prevent the spread of 
                nuclear 
                weapons.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings contained in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the United States has a 
national security interest in assisting other countries to improve the 
security of their stocks of fissile material.

    This title may be cited as the ``Defense Against Weapons of Mass 
Destruction Act of 1996''.

SEC. 1402. <<NOTE: 50 USC 2301 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and 
        technologies are increasingly available from worldwide sources. 
        Technical information relating to such weapons is readily 
        available on the Internet, and raw materials for chemical, 
        biological, and radiological weapons are widely available for 
        legitimate commercial purposes.
            (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast 
        array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass 
        destruction.
            (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain the 
        facilities, materials, and technologies capable of producing 
        additional quantities of weapons of mass destruction.
            (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was 
        accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, 
        deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related 
        materials and technologies, economic hardships, and significant 
        gaps in border control among the states of the former Soviet 
        Union. The problems of organized crime and corruption in the 
        states of the former Soviet Union increase the potential for 
        proliferation of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical 
        weapons and related materials.
            (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have 
        substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile 
        nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons of 
        mass destruction and related materials and technologies from 
        within the states of the former Soviet Union and from unemployed 
        scientists who worked on those programs.
            (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of 
        potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire 
        nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is 
        greater than at any time in history.
            (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, 
        and Libya as hostile states which already possess some weapons 
        of mass destruction and are developing others.
            (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons of 
        mass destruction is well within the capability of many extremist 
        and terrorist movements, acting independently or as proxies for 
        foreign states.
            (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid 
        extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with plausible 
        deniability.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2716]]

            (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical 
        attacks against civilian targets in the United States and Japan, 
        and a radiological attack in Russia.
            (11) The potential for the national security of the United 
        States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, or 
        biological terrorism must be taken seriously.
            (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by 
        weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military 
        targets in the usual sense of the term.
            (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the 
        United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical 
        weapons delivered by unconventional means is significant and 
        growing.
            (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents 
        involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical 
        materials.
            (15) Facilities required for production of radiological, 
        biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder to 
        detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological and 
        chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery means 
        other than long-range ballistic missiles.
            (16) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, 
        radiological, biological, and chemical weapons include cargo 
        ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private vehicles and 
        vessels, and commercial cargo shipments routed through 
        multiple destinations.
            (17) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state 
        efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons 
        production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and 
        controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, 
        unconventional proliferation efforts.
            (18) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do 
        little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a 
        capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical or 
        biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies and 
        equipment.
            (19) The United States lacks adequate planning and 
        countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, radiological, 
        biological, and chemical terrorism.
            (20) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear 
        Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear or 
        radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to deal 
        with emergencies involving biological or chemical weapons or 
        related materials.
            (21) State and local emergency response personnel are not 
        adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving nuclear, 
        radiological, biological, or chemical materials.
            (22) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to 
        nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have 
        revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe 
        problems of coordination.
            (23) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities 
        for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, 
        biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States requires 
        well-coordinated participation of many Federal agencies, and 
        careful planning by the Federal Government and State and local 
        governments.
            (24) Training and exercises can significantly improve the 
        preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel

[[Page 110 STAT. 2717]]

        for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or 
        chemical weapons or related materials.
            (25) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the 
        Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided 
        assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in 
        neutralizing, dis-
        mantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance, as well as 
        radiological, biological, and chemical materials, can be a vital 

        contribution to the development and deployment of 
        countermeasures against nuclear, biological, and chemical 
        weapons of mass destruction.
            (26) The United States lacks effective policy coordination 
        regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of 
        mass destruction.

                          EMPLOYEES DUE TO PRIVATIZATION AT CLOSED 
                          MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Pilot Programs Authorized.--(1) The Secretary of Defense, after 
consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, 
may establish one or more pilot programs under which Federal retirement 
benefits are provided in accordance with this section to persons who 
convert from Federal employment to employment by a Department of Defense 
contractor in connection with the privatization of the performance of 
functions at selected military installations being closed under the base 
closure and realignment process.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall select the military installations 
to be covered by a pilot program under this section.
    (b) Eligible Converted Employees.--(1) A person is a converted 
employee eligible for Federal retirement benefits under this section if 
the person is a former employee of the Department of Defense (other than 
a temporary employee) who--
            (A) while employed by the Department of Defense at a 
        military installation selected to participate in a pilot 
        program, performed a function that was recommended, in a report 
        of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted 
        to the President under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        Act of 1990 (title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687

        being notified that the employee would be separated in a 
        reduction in force resulting from such privatization;
            (C) at the time separated from Federal service, was covered 
        under the Civil Service Retirement System, but was not eligible

[[Page 110 STAT. 2742]]

            (D) does not withdraw retirement contributions under section 
        8342 of title 5, United States Code;

        the defense contractor selected to privatize the function to 
        perform substantially the same function performed by the person 
        before the separation; and
            (F) remains employed by the defense contractor (or a 
        successor defense contractor) or subcontractor of the defense 
        contractor (or successor defense contractor) until attaining 
        early deferred retirement age (unless the employment is sooner 
        involuntarily terminated for reasons other than performance or 
        conduct of the employee).

    (2) A person who, under paragraph (1), would otherwise be eligible 
for an early deferred annuity under this section shall not be eligible 
for such benefits if the person received separation pay or severance pay 
due to a separation described in subparagraph (B) of that paragraph 
unless the person repays the full amount of such pay with interest 
(computed at a rate determined appropriate by the Director of the Office 
of Personnel Management) to the Department of Defense before attaining 
early deferred retirement age.
    (c) Retirement Benefits of Converted Employees.--In the case of a 
converted employee covered by a pilot program, payment of a deferred 
annuity for which the converted employee is eligible under section 
8338(a) of title 5, United States Code, shall commence on the first day 
of the first month that begins after the date on which the converted 
employee attains early deferred retirement age, notwithstanding the age 
requirement under that section. If the employment of a converted 
employee is involuntarily terminated by the defense contractor or 
subcontractor as described in subsection (b)(1)(F) and the converted 
employee resumes Federal service before the converted employee attains 
early deferred retirement age, the converted employee shall once again 
be covered under the Civil Service Retirement System instead of the 
pilot program.
    (d) Computation of Average Pay.--(1)(A) This paragraph applies to a 
converted employee who was employed in a position classified under the 
General Schedule immediately before the employee's covered separation 
from Federal service.
    (B) Subject to subparagraph (C), for purposes of computing the 
deferred annuity for a converted employee referred to in subparagraph 
(A), the average pay of the converted employee, computed under section 
8331(4) of title 5, United States Code, as of the date of the employee's 
covered separation from Federal service, shall be adjusted at the same 
time and by the same percentage that rates of basic pay are increased 
under section 5303 of such title during the period beginning on that 
date and ending on the date on which the converted employee attains 
early deferred retirement age.
    (C) The average pay of a converted employee, as adjusted under 
subparagraph (B), may not exceed the amount to which an annuity of the 
converted employee could be increased under section 8340 of title 5, 
United States Code, in accordance with the limitation in subsection 
(g)(1) of such section (relating to maximum pay, final pay, or average 
pay).

[[Page 110 STAT. 2743]]

    (2)(A) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> This paragraph applies to a 
converted employee who was a prevailing rate employee (as defined under 
section 5342(2) of title 5, United States Code) immediately before the 
employee's covered separation from Federal service.

    (B) For purposes of computing the deferred annuity for a converted 
employee referred to in subparagraph (A), the average pay of the 
converted employee, computed under section 8331(4) of title 5, United 
States Code, as of the date of the employee's covered separation from 
Federal service, shall be adjusted at the same time and by the same 
percentage that pay rates for positions that are in the same area as, 
and are comparable to, the last position the converted employee held as 
a prevailing rate employee, are increased under section 5343(a) of such 
title during the period beginning on that date and ending on the date on 
which the converted employee attains early deferred retirement age.
    (e) Payment of Unfunded Liability.--(1) The military department 
concerned shall be liable for that portion of any estimated increase in 
the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund established under section 8348 of title 5, United States Code, 
which is attributable to any benefits payable from such Fund to a 
converted employee, and any survivor of a converted employee, when the 
increase results from--
            (A) an increase in the average pay of the converted employee 
        under subsection (d) upon which such benefits are computed; and
            (B) the commencement of an early deferred annuity in 
        accordance with this section before the attainment of 62 years 
        of age by the converted employee.

    (2) The estimated increase in the unfunded liability for each 
department referred to in paragraph (1) shall be determined by the 
Director of the Office of Personnel Management. In making the 
determination, the Director shall consider any savings to the Fund as a 
result of a pilot program established under this section. The Secretary 
of the military department concerned shall pay the amount so determined 
to the Director in 10 equal annual installments with interest computed 
at the rate used in the most recent valuation of the Civil Service 
Retirement System, with the first payment thereof due at the end of the 
fiscal year in which an increase in average pay under subsection (d) 
becomes effective.
    (f) Contractor Service Not Creditable.--Service performed by a 
converted employee for a defense contractor after the employee's covered 
separation from Federal service is not creditable service for purposes 
of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code.
    (g) Receipt of Benefits While Employed by a Defense Contractor.--A 
converted employee may commence receipt of an early deferred annuity in 
accordance with this section while continuing to work for a defense 
contractor.
    (h) Lump-Sum Credit Payment.--If a converted employee dies before 
attaining early deferred retirement age, such employee shall be treated 
as a former employee who dies not retired for purposes of payment of the 
lump-sum credit under section 8342(d) of title 5, United States Code.
    (i) Continued Federal Health Benefits Coverage.--Notwithstanding 
section 8905a(e)(1)(A) of title 5, United States Code, the continued 
coverage of a converted employee for health benefits under chapter 89 of 
such title by reason of the application of

[[Page 110 STAT. 2744]]

section 8905a of such title to such employee shall terminate 90 days 
after the date of the employee's covered separation from 
Federal employment. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a person 
who, except for subsection (b)(2), would be a converted employee shall 
be considered a converted employee.
    (j) Report by General Accounting Office.--The Comptroller General 
shall conduct a study of each pilot program, if any, established under 
this section and submit a report on the pilot program to Congress not 
later than two years after the date on which the program is established. 
The report shall contain the following:
            (1) A review and evaluation of the program, including--
                    (A) an evaluation of the success of the

                    (B) a comparison and evaluation of such 
                privatization outcomes with the privatization outcomes 
                with respect to facilities at other military 
                installations closed or realigned under the base closure 
                laws;
                    (C) an evaluation of the impact of the program on 
                the Federal workforce and whether the program results in 
                the maintenance of a skilled workforce for defense 
                contractors at an acceptable cost to the military 
                department concerned; and
                    (D) an assessment of the extent to which the program 
                is a cost-effective means of facilitating privatization 
                of the performance of Federal activities.
            (2) Recommendations relating to the expansion of the program 
        to other installations and employees.

Secretary of Defense notifies the Director of the Office of Personnel

        prevents opening such contaminated lands to operation of the 
        public land laws.

    (b) Program of Decontamination.--
            (1) In general.--Throughout the duration of the withdrawal 
        and reservation made by this subtitle, the Secretary of the

        case of lands subject to a relinquishment notice under section 
        2908(c) that are contaminated, the Secretary of the Army shall 
        decontaminate the land to the extent that funds are appropriated 
        for such purpose if the Secretary of the Interior, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of the Army, determines that--
                    (A) decontamination of the lands is practicable and 
                economically feasible, taking into consideration the 
                potential future use and value of the land; and
                    (B) upon decontamination, the land could be opened 
                to the operation of some or all of the public land laws, 
                including the mining laws.

    (c) Authority of Secretary of the Interior To Refuse Contaminated 
Lands.--The Secretary of the Interior shall not be required to accept

Secretary of the Interior conclude that--

[[Page 110 STAT. 2812]]

            (1) decontamination of any or all of the lands proposed for 
        relinquishment is not practicable or economically feasible;
            (2) the lands cannot be decontaminated sufficiently to allow 
        them to be opened to the operation of the public land 
        laws; or
            (3) insufficient funds are appropriated for the purpose of 
        decontaminating the lands.

    (d) Effect of Continued Contamination.--If the Secretary of the 
Interior declines under subsection (c) to accept jurisdiction of lands 
proposed for relinquishment or if the Secretary of the Interior

        to warn the public of the contaminated state of such lands and 
        any risks associated with entry onto such lands;
            (2) after the expiration of the withdrawal, the Secretary of

Secretary of the Navy certifies that the lands are safe for nonmilitary 
uses, the Secretary of the Interior shall reconsider accepting 
jurisdiction over the lands.
    (h) Revocation Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, upon deciding that it is in the public interest to accept 
jurisdiction over lands specified in a relinquishment notice, the

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States is committed to proceeding with a 
        robust, science-based stockpile stewardship program with respect 
        to production of nuclear weapons, and to maintaining nuclear 
        weapons production capabilities and capacities, that are 
        adequate--
                    (A) to ensure the safety, reliability, and 
                performance of the United States nuclear arsenal; and
                    (B) to meet such changing national security 
                requirements as may result from international 
                developments or technical problems with nuclear 
                warheads.
            (2) The United States is committed to reestablishing and 
        maintaining production facilities for nuclear weapons components 
        at levels that are sufficient--
                    (A) to satisfy requirements for the safety, 
                reliability, and performance of United States nuclear 
                weapons; and
                    (B) to demonstrate and sustain production 
                capabilities and capacities.
            (3) The United States is committed to maintaining the 
        nuclear weapons laboratories and protecting core nuclear 
        weapons competencies.
            (4) The United States is committed to ensuring rapid access 
        to a new production source of tritium within the next decade, as 
        it currently has no meaningful capability to produce tritium, a 
        component that is essential to the performance of modern nuclear 
        weapons.
            (5) The United States reserves the right, consistent with 
        United States law, to resume underground nuclear testing to 
        maintain confidence in the United States stockpile of nuclear 
        weapons if warhead design flaws or aging of nuclear weapons

[[Page 110 STAT. 2846]]

        result in problems that a robust stockpile stewardship program 
        cannot solve.
            (6) The United States is committed to funding the Nevada 
        Test Site at a level that maintains the ability of the United 
        States to resume underground nuclear testing within one year 
        after a national decision to do so is made.
            (7) The United States reserves the right to invoke the 
        supreme national interest of the United States and withdraw from 
        any future arms control agreement to limit underground nuclear 
        testing.

    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Presidential Con-
sultation With Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President 
should consult closely with Congress regarding United States policy and 
practices to ensure confidence in the safety, reliability, and 
performance of the nuclear stockpile of the United States.
    (c) <<NOTE: President.>>  Sense of Congress Regarding Notification 
and Consultation.--It is the sense of Congress that, upon a 
determination by the President that a problem with the safety, 
reliability, or performance of the nuclear stockpile has occurred and 
that the problem cannot be corrected within the stockpile stewardship 
program, the President shall--
            (1) immediately notify Congress of the problem; and
            (2) submit to Congress in a timely manner a plan for 
        corrective action with respect to the problem, including--
                    (A) a technical description of the activities 
                required under the plan; and
                    (B) if underground testing of nuclear weapons would 
                assist in such corrective action, an assessment of the 
                advisability of withdrawing from any treaty that 
                prohibits underground testing of nuclear weapons.

[[Page 110 STAT. 2866]]

    ``(2) No funds may be authorized for the use of the Commission, or 
obligated or expended by the Commission in any fiscal year; in excess 
of--
            ``(A) the amount of revenues deposited in the Panama Canal 
        Revolving Fund and the Panama Canal Commission Dissolution Fund

    ``(d)(1) It is the sense of the Congress that the additional costs 
resulting from the implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and 
related agreements should be kept to the absolute minimum level. To this 
end, the Congress declares appropriated costs of implementation to be 
borne by the taxpayers over the life of such Treaty should be kept to a 
level no greater than the March 1979 estimate of those costs 
($870,700,000) presented to the Congress by the executive branch during 
consideration of this Act by the Congress, less personnel retirement 
costs of $205,000,000, which were subtracted and charged to tolls, 
therefore resulting in net taxpayer cost of approximately $665,700,000, 
plus appropriate adjustments for inflation.
    ``(2) It is further the sense of the Congress that the actual costs 
of implementation be consistent with the obligations of the United 
States to operate the Panama Canal safely and efficiently and keep it 
secure.''.
