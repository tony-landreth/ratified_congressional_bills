                marine mammal oils, within the meaning of paragraph (2) 
                of section 61(a) of title 13, United States Code, and 
                oils of vegetable origin, including oils from the seeds,

    (b) Considerations.--In differentiating between the class of fats, 
oils, and greases described in subsection (a)(1)(A) and the class of

        Regulatory Reform Act)''.

        could be subjected under section 1004(a)(2) or (d)'' and 
        inserting ``the responsible party could be subjected under
