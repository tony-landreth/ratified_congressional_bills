    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

Energy Regulatory Commission, upon the request of the licensee for FERC 
Project No. 3701, is authorized, in accordance with the good faith, due 
diligence, and public interest requirements of section 13 and the 
Commission's procedures under such section, to extend the time required 
for the licensee to commence the construction of such project for up to

This section shall take effect for the project upon the expiration of 
the extension (issued by the Commission under section 13) of the period 
required for commencement of construction of such project. If the
