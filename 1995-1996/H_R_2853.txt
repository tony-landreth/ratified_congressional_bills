To authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-
    nation treatment) to the products of Bulgaria. <<NOTE: July 18, 
                         1996 -  [H.R. 2853]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 19 USC 2434 note.>> CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND 
            SUPPLEMENTAL ACTION.

    (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that Bulgaria--
            (1) has received most-favored-nation treatment since 1991 
        and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of 
        emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 
        since 1993;
            (2) has reversed many years of Communist dictatorship and 
        instituted a constitutional republic ruled by a democratically 
        elected government as well as basic market-oriented reforms, 
        including privatization;
            (3) is in the process of acceding to the General Agreement 
        on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization 
        (WTO), and extension of unconditional most-favored-nation 
        treatment would enable the United States to avail itself of all 
        rights under the GATT and the WTO with respect to Bulgaria; and
            (4) has demonstrated a strong desire to build friendly 
        relationships and to cooperate fully with the United States on 
        trade matters.

    (b) Supplemental Action.--The Congress notes that the United States 
Trade Representative intends to negotiate with Bulgaria in order to 
preserve the commitments of that country under the bilateral commercial 
agreement in effect between that country and the United States that are 
consistent with the GATT and the WTO.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 19 USC 2434 note.>> TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE 
            IV OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974 TO BULGARIA.

    (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of Nondiscriminatory 
Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act 
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may--
            (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to 
        Bulgaria; and
            (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with 
        respect to Bulgaria, proclaim the extension of nondiscriminatory 
        treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to the products of 
        that country.

    (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On and after the 
effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) of 
nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Bulgaria, title IV of the 
Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to apply to that country.

    Approved July 18, 1996.
