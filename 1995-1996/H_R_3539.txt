                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 221. <<NOTE: 49 USC 106 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, 
        being one of the few non-defense government agencies that 
        operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while continuing 
        to rely on outdated technology to carry out its responsibilities 
        for a state-of-the-art industry.
            (2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation 
        system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, with 
        the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. The 
        General Fund contribution over the years is one measure of the 
        benefit received by the general public, military, and other 
        users of Administration's services.

[[Page 110 STAT. 3228]]

            (3) The Administration must become a more efficient, 
        effective, and different organization to meet future challenges.
            (4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it may 
        become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient General Fund 
        contributions to meet the Administration's future budget needs.
            (5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the 
        national air transportation system by seeking to spend all 
        moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the 
        Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses representing 
        past receipts must also be spent for the purposes for which such 
        funds were collected.
            (6) The aviation community and the employees of the 
        Administration must come together to improve the system. The 
        Administration must continue to recognize who its customers are 
        and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the system 
        to make safety improvements and increase productivity.
            (7) The Administration projects that commercial operations 
        will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 percent 
        by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion and system 
        modernization, these needs cannot be met.
            (8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future 
        challenges and needs cannot be met.
            (9) The Administration must have a new way of doing 
        business.
            (10) There is widespread agreement within government and the 
        aviation industry that reform of the Administration is essential 
        to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected growth of 
        aviation within the next decade.
            (11) To the extent that Congress determines that certain 
        segments of the aviation community are not required to pay all 
        of the costs of the government services which they require and 
        benefits which they receive, Congress should appropriate the 
        difference between such costs and any receipts received from 
        such segment.
            (12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user fees 
        on segments of the industry, an independent review must be 
        performed to assess the funding needs and assumptions for 
        operations, capital spending, and airport infrastructure.
            (13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and 
        assessment must be performed of the costs to the Administration 
        and the costs driven by each segment of the aviation system for 
        safety and operational services, including the use of the air 
        traffic control system and the Nation's airports.
            (14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity 
        in that it is a participant in the daily operations of an 
        industry, and because the national air transportation system 
        faces significant problems without significant changes, the 
        Administration has been authorized to change the Federal 
        procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the 
        Administration has the ability to keep pace with new technology 
        and is able to match resources with the real personnel needs of 
        the Administration.
            (15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-term 
        planning or timely acquisition of technology by the 
        Administration.

[[Page 110 STAT. 3229]]

            (16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, personnel, 
        funding, and governance, the Administration will continue to 
        experience delays and cost overruns in its major modernization 
        programs and needed improvements in the performance of the air 
        traffic management system will not occur.
            (17) All reforms should be designed to help the 
        Administration become more responsive to the needs of its 
        customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.

SEC. 222. <<NOTE: 49 USC 106 note.>> PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to ensure that final action shall be taken on all 
        notices of proposed rulemaking of the Administration within 18 
        months after the date of their publication;
            (2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional review, 
        to establish a program to improve air traffic management system 
        performance and to establish appropriate levels of cost 
        accountability for air traffic management services provided by 
        the Administration;
            (3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable 
        Administration within the Department of Transportation; and
            (4) to make the Administration a more efficient and 
        effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, 
        growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling 
        public.

SEC. 223. REGULATION OF CIVILIAN AIR TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED SERVICES 
            BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT OF 
            TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) In General.--Section 106 is amended--

                      Administrator may''; and

                      ``or''; and

            (7) The Administration each year performs more than 355,000 
        inspections.

        licenses and more than 560,000 nonpilot's licenses (including 
        mechanics).
            (9) The Administration's certification means that the 
        product meets world-wide recognized standards of safety and 
        reliability.
            (10) The Administration's certification means aviation-
        related equipment and services meet world-wide recognized 
        standards.
            (11) The Administration's certification is recognized by 
        governments and businesses throughout the world and as such may 
        be a valuable element for any company desiring to sell aviation-
        related products throughout the world.
            (12) The Administration's certification may constitute a

            (1) there has been an intensification in the oppression and 
        disregard for human life among nations that are willing to 
        export terrorism;
            (2) there has been an increase in attempts by criminal 
        terrorists to murder airline passengers through the destruction 
        of civilian airliners and the deliberate fear and death 
        inflicted through bombings of buildings and the kidnapping of 
        tourists and Americans residing abroad; and
            (3) information widely available demonstrates that a 
        significant portion of international terrorist activity is 
        state-sponsored, -organized, -condoned, or -directed.

[[Page 110 STAT. 3255]]

    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that if 
evidence establishes beyond a clear and reasonable doubt that any act of 
hostility towards any United States citizen was an act of international 
terrorism sponsored, organized, condoned, or directed by any nation, a 
state of war should be considered to exist or to have existed between 
the United States and that nation, beginning as of the moment that the 
act of aggression occurs.

 TITLE <<NOTE: Airport Revenue Protection Act of 1996.>> VIII--AIRPORT 
REVENUE PROTECTION

SEC. 801. <<NOTE: 49 USC 40101 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Airport Revenue Protection Act of 
1996''.

[[Page 110 STAT. 3270]]

SEC. 802. <<NOTE: 49 USC 47107 note.>> FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) In General.--Congress finds that--
            (1) section 47107 of title 49, United States Code, prohibits 
        the diversion of certain revenue generated by a public airport 
        as a condition of receiving a project grant;
            (2) a grant recipient that uses airport revenue for purposes 
        that are not airport related in a manner inconsistent with 
        chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code, illegally diverts 
        airport revenues;
            (3) any diversion of airport revenues in violation of the 
        condition referred to in paragraph (1) undermines the interest 
        of the United States in promoting a strong national air 
        transportation system that is responsive to the needs of airport 
        users;
            (4) the Secretary and the Administrator have not enforced 
        airport revenue diversion rules adequately and must have 
        additional regulatory tools to increase enforcement efforts; and
            (5) sponsors who have been found to have illegally diverted 
        airport revenues--
                    (A) have not reimbursed or made restitution to 
                airports in a timely manner; and
                    (B) must be encouraged to do so.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to ensure that airport 
users are not burdened with hidden taxation for unrelated municipal 
services and activities by--
            (1) eliminating the ability of any State or political 
        subdivision thereof that is a recipient of a project grant to 
        divert airport revenues for purposes that are not related to an 
        airport, in violation of section 47107 of title 49, United 
        States Code;
            (2) imposing financial reporting requirements that are 
        designed to identify instances of illegal diversions referred to 
        in paragraph (1);
            (3) establishing a statute of limitations for airport 
        revenue diversion actions;
            (4) clarifying limitations on revenue diversion that are 
        permitted under chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code; and
            (5) establishing clear penalties and enforcement mechanisms 
        for identifying and prosecuting airport revenue diversion.

SEC. 803. <<NOTE: 49 USC 47107 note.>> DEFINITIONS.

    For purposes of this title, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.
            (2) Airport.--The term ``airport'' has the meaning provided 
        that term in section 47102(2) of title 49, United States Code.

        meaning provided that term in section 47102(14) of title 49, 
        United States Code.
            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Transportation.

operator, provides that the revenues, including local taxes on aviation 
fuel at public airports, from any of the facilities of the owner or 
operator, including the airport, be used to support not only the airport 
but also the general debt obligations or other facilities of the owner 
or operator.
    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be 
construed to prevent the use of a State tax on aviation fuel to support 
a State aviation program or the use of airport revenue on or off the 
airport for a noise mitigation purpose.''.
    (b) Penalties.--Section 46301(a)(5) is amended to read as

        increased above the otherwise applicable maximum amount under 
        this section to an amount not to exceed 3 times the amount of

SEC. 1212. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FUNDING OF THE FEDERAL 
            AVIATION ADMINISTRATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) Congress is responsible for ensuring that the financial 
        needs of the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that 
        performs the critical function of overseeing the Nation's air 
        traffic control system and ensuring the safety of air travelers 
        in the United States, are met;
            (2) aviation excise taxes that constitute the Airport and 
        Airway Trust Fund, which provides most of the funding for the 
        Federal Aviation Administration, have expired;
            (3) the surplus in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund will be 
        spent by the Federal Aviation Administration by December 1996;
            (4) the existing system of funding the Federal Aviation 
        Administration will not provide the agency with sufficient 
        short-term or long-term funding;
            (5) this Act creates a sound process to review Federal 
        Aviation Administration funding and develop a funding system to 
        meet the Federal Aviation Administration's long-term funding 
        needs; and

[[Page 110 STAT. 3283]]

            (6) without immediate action by Congress to ensure that the 
        Federal Aviation Administration's financial needs are met, air 
        travelers' confidence in the system could be undermined.

    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that there 
should be an immediate enactment of an 18-month reinstatement of the 
aviation excise taxes to provide short-term funding for the Federal 
Aviation Administration.

SEC. 1213. RURAL AIR FARE STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to--
            (1) compare air fares paid (calculated as both actual and

                    (A) between--
                          (i) nonhub airports located in small 
                      communities; and
                          (ii) large hub airports; and
                    (B) between large hub airports;
            (2) analyze--
                    (A) the extent to which passenger service that is 
                provided from nonhub airports is provided on--
                          (i) regional commuter commercial air carriers; 
                      or
                          (ii) major air carriers;
                    (B) the type of aircraft employed in providing 
                passenger service at nonhub airports; and
                    (C) whether there is competition among commercial 
                air carriers with respect to the provision of air 
                service to passengers from nonhub airports.

    (b) Findings.--The Secretary shall include in the report of the 
study conducted under subsection (a) findings concerning--
            (1) whether passengers who use commercial air carriers to 
        and from rural areas (as defined by the Secretary) pay a 
        disproportionately greater price for that transportation than 
        passengers who use commercial air carriers between urban areas 
        (as defined by the Secretary);
            (2) the nature of competition, if any, in rural markets (as 
        defined by the Secretary) for commercial air carriers;
            (3) whether a relationship exists between higher air fares 
        and competition among commercial air carriers for passengers 
        traveling on jet aircraft from small communities (as defined by 
        the Secretary) and, if such a relation exists, the nature of 
        that relationship;
            (4) the number of small communities that have lost air 
        service as a result of the deregulation of commercial air 
        carriers with respect to air fares;
            (5) the number of small communities served by airports with 
        respect to which, after commercial air carrier fares were 
        deregulated, jet aircraft service was replaced by turboprop 
        aircraft service; and
            (6) where such replacement occurred, any corresponding 
        decreases in available seat capacity for consumers at the 
        airports referred to in that subparagraph.

    (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a final report on the study
