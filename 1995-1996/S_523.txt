    The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act (43 U.S.C. 1571 et

            (1) in section 202(a)-- <<NOTE: 43 USC 1592.>>

                          (i) by striking ``the following salinity 
                      control units'' and inserting ``the following 
                      salinity control units and salinity control 
                      program''; and
                          (ii) by striking the period and inserting a 
                      colon; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraph:
            ``(6) A basinwide salinity control program that the 
        Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, shall 
        implement. The Secretary may carry out the purposes of this 
        paragraph directly, or may make grants, commitments for grants, 
        or advances of funds to non-Federal entities under such terms 
        and conditions as the Secretary may require. Such program shall 
        consist of cost-effective measures and associated works to 
        reduce salinity from saline springs, leaking wells, irrigation 
        sources, industrial sources, erosion of public and private land, 
        or other sources that the Secretary considers appropriate. Such 
        program shall provide for the mitigation of incidental fish and 
        wildlife values that are lost as a result of the measures and 
        associated works. <<NOTE: Reports.>>  The Secretary shall submit 
        a planning report concerning the program established under this 
        paragraph to the appropriate committees of Congress. The 
        Secretary may not expend funds for any implementation measure 
        under the program established under this paragraph before the 
        expiration of a 30-day period beginning on the date on which the 
        Secretary submits such report.'';
            (2) in section 205(a)-- <<NOTE: 43 USC 1595.>> 
                    (A) in paragraph (1) by striking ``authorized by 
                section 202(a) (4) and (5)'' and inserting ``authorized 
                by paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 202(a)''; and
                    (B) in paragraph (4)(i), by striking ``sections 
                202(a)(4) and (5)'' each place it appears and inserting 
                ``paragraphs (4) through (6) of section 202'';

[[Page 109 STAT. 256]]

            (3) in section 208, <<NOTE: 43 USC 1598.>>  by adding at the 
        end the following new subsection:

    ``(c) In addition to the amounts authorized to be

(b), there are authorized to be appropriated $75,000,000 for subsection 
202(a), including constructing the works described in paragraph 
202(a)(6) and carrying out the measures described in such paragraph. 
Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Secretary may implement the program 
under paragraph 202(a)(6) only to the extent and in such amounts as are 
provided in advance in appropriations Acts.''; and
            (4) in subsection 202(b)(4) <<NOTE: 43 USC 1592.>> delete 
        ``units authorized to be constructed pursuant to paragraphs (1), 
        (2), (3), (4), and (5)'' and insert in lieu thereof ``units 
        authorized to be constructed or the program pursuant to 
        paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6)''.
