Public Law 104-203
104th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To extend nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to 
                                  the 
    products of Cambodia, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Sept. 25, 
                         1996 -  [H.R. 1642]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) despite recent increases in acts of repression by the 
        Cambodian Government and growing government corruption that has 
        contributed to substantial environmental degradation, Cambodia 
        has made some progress towards democratic rule after 20 years of 
        undemocratic regimes and civil war, and is striving to rebuild 
        its market economy;
            (2) extension of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment 
        would assist Cambodia in developing its economy based on free 
        market principles and becoming competitive in the global 
        marketplace;
            (3) establishing normal commercial relations on a reciprocal 
        basis with Cambodia will promote United States exports to the 
        rapidly growing Southeast Asian region and expand opportunities 
        for United States business and investment in the Cambodian 
        economy; and
            (4) expanding bilateral trade relations that includes a 
        commercial agreement may promote further progress by Cambodia on 
        human rights and democratic rule and assist 
        Cambodia in adopting regional and world trading rules and 
        principles.

SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PRODUCTS OF 
            CAMBODIA.

    (a) Harmonized Tariff Schedule Amendment.--General note 3(b) of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended by striking 
``Kampuchea''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>>  
amendment made by subsection (a) applies with respect to goods entered, 
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective 
date of a notice published in the Federal Register by the United States 
Trade Representative that a trade agreement obligating reciprocal most-
favored-nation treatment between Cambodia and the United States has 
entered into force.
