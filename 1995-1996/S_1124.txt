        Acquisition and Technology conduct oversight over the 
        development and improvement of the nuclear attack submarine 
        program of the Navy. Officials of the Department of the Navy 
        exercising management oversight of the program shall report to 
        the Under

[[Page 110 STAT. 208]]

        Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology with respect 
        to that program.

    (c) Plan for Fiscal Year 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 Submarines.--(1) 
The Secretary of Defense shall, not later than March 15, 1996, develop 
(and submit to the committees specified in subsection (b)(2)(A)) a 
detailed plan for development of a program that will lead to production 
of a more capable, less expensive submarine than the submarine 
previously designated as the New Attack Submarine.
    (2) As part of such plan, the Secretary shall provide for a program 
for the design, development, and procurement of four nuclear attack 
submarines to be procured during fiscal years 1998 through 2001, the 
purpose of which shall be to develop and demonstrate new technologies 
that will result in each successive submarine of those four being a more 
capable and more affordable submarine than the submarine that preceded 
it. The program shall be structured so that--
            (A) one of the four submarines is to be constructed with 
        funds appropriated for each fiscal year from fiscal year 1998 
        through fiscal year 2001;
            (B) in order to ensure flexibility for innovation, the 
        fiscal year 1998 and the fiscal year 2000 submarines are to be 
        constructed by the Electric Boat Division and the fiscal year 
        1999 and the fiscal year 2001 submarines are to be constructed 
        by Newport News Shipbuilding;
            (C) the design designated by the Navy for the submarine 
        previously designated as the New Attack Submarine will be used 
        as the base design by both contractors;
            (D) each contractor shall be called upon to propose 
        improvements, including design improvements, for each successive 
        submarine as new and better technology is demonstrated and 
        matures so that--
                    (i) each successive submarine is more capable and 
                more affordable; and
                    (ii) the design for a future class of nuclear attack 
                submarines will incorporate the latest, best, and most 
                affordable technology; and
            (E) the fifth and subsequent nuclear attack submarines to be 
        built after the SSN-23 submarine shall be procured as required 
        by subsection (b)(1).

    (3) The plan under paragraph (1) shall--
            (A) set forth a program to accomplish the design, 
        development, and construction of the four submarines taking 
        maximum advantage of a streamlined acquisition process, as 
        provided under subsection (d);
            (B) culminate in selection of a design for a next submarine 
        for serial production not earlier than fiscal year 2003, with 
        such submarine to be procured as required by subsection (b)(1);
            (C) identify advanced technologies that are in various 
        phases of research and development, as well as those that are 
        commercially available off-the-shelf, that are candidates to be 
        incorporated into the plan to design, develop, and procure the 
        submarines;
            (D) designate the fifth submarine to be procured as the lead 
        ship in the next generation submarine class, unless the 
        Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with the special 
        submarine review panel described in subsection (f), determines

[[Page 110 STAT. 209]]

        that more submarines should be built before the design of the 
        new class of submarines is fixed, in which case each such 
        additional submarine shall be procured in the same manner as is 
        required by subsection (b)(1); and

  Subtitle C--Ballistic Missile Defense Act <<NOTE: Ballistic Missile 
Defense Act of 1995. 10 USC 2431 note.>> of 1995

SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Ballistic Missile Defense Act of 
1995''.

SEC. 232. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The emerging threat that is posed to the national 
        security interests of the United States by the proliferation of 
        ballistic missiles is significant and growing, both in terms of 
        numbers of missiles and in terms of the technical capabilities 
        of those missiles.
            (2) The deployment of ballistic missile defenses is a 
        necessary, but not sufficient, element of a broader strategy to 
        discourage both the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
        and the proliferation of the means of their delivery and to 
        defend against the consequences of such proliferation.
            (3) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense 
        systems can deter potential adversaries of the United States 
        from escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United 
        States forces or the forces or territory of coalition partners 
        or allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed 
        with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational and 
        technical advantages of the United States and its coalition 
        partners and allies.
            (4) United States intelligence officials have provided 
        intelligence estimates to congressional committees that (A) the 
        trend

[[Page 110 STAT. 229]]

        in missile proliferation is toward longer range and more 
        sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) North Korea may deploy an 
        intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or 
        beyond within five years, and (C) although a new, indigenously 
        developed ballistic missile threat to the continental United 
        States is not foreseen within the next ten years, determined 
        countries can acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the 
        near future and with little warning by means other than 
        indigenous development.
            (5) The development and deployment by the United States and 
        its allies of effective defenses against ballistic missiles of 
        all ranges will reduce the incentives for countries to acquire 
        such missiles or to augment existing missile capabilities.
            (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction (based upon an 
        offense-only form of deterrence), which is the major 
        philosophical rationale underlying the ABM Treaty, is now 
        questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar world in 
        which the United States and the states of the former Soviet 
        Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate Cold War 
        attitudes and arrangements.
            (7) The development and deployment of a National Missile 
        Defense system against the threat of limited ballistic missile 
        attacks--
                    (A) would strengthen deterrence at the levels of 
                forces agreed to by the United States and Russia under 
                the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks Treaty (START-I); and
                    (B) would further strengthen deterrence if 
                reductions below the levels permitted under START-I 
                should be agreed to and implemented in the future.
            (8) The distinction made during the Cold War, based upon the 
        technology of the time, between strategic ballistic missiles and 
        nonstrategic ballistic missiles, which resulted in the 
        distinction made in the ABM Treaty between strategic defense and 
        nonstrategic defense, has become obsolete because of 
        technological advancement (including the development by North 
        Korea of long-range Taepo-Dong I and Taepo-Dong II missiles) 
        and, therefore, that distinction in the ABM Treaty should be 
        reviewed.

SEC. 233. BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to deploy affordable and operationally effective theater 
        missile defenses to protect forward-deployed and expeditionary 
        elements of the Armed Forces of the United States and to 
        complement the missile defense capabilities of forces of 
        coalition partners and of allies of the United States; and
            (2) to seek a cooperative, negotiated transition to a regime 
        that does not feature an offense-only form of deterrence as the 
        basis for strategic stability.

SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.

    (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy 
established in paragraph (1) of section 233, the Secretary of Defense 
shall restructure the core theater missile defense program to consist of 
the following systems, to be carried out so as to achieve the specified 
capabilities:
            (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with a first unit equipped 
        (FUE) during fiscal year 1998.

[[Page 110 STAT. 230]]

            (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user 
        operational evaluation system (UOES) capability during fiscal 
        year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) during 
        fiscal year 1999.
            (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, 
        with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability not 
        later than fiscal year 1998 and a first unit equipped (FUE) not 
        later than fiscal year 2000.
            (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user 
        operational evaluation system (UOES) capability during fiscal 
        year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) during 
        fiscal year 2001.

    (b) Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and 
procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of developing 
and deploying the theater missile defense systems specified in 
subsection (a).
    (c) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To maximize 
effectiveness and flexibility of the systems comprising the core theater 
missile defense program, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that 
those systems are integrated and complementary and are fully capable of 
exploiting external sensor and battle management support from systems 
such as--
            (A) the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system of 
        the Navy;
            (B) airborne sensors; and
            (C) space-based sensors (including, in particular, the Space 
        and Missile Tracking System).

    (d) Follow-on Systems.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prepare 
an affordable development plan for theater missile defense systems to be 
developed as follow-on systems to the core systems specified in 
subsection (a). The Secretary shall make the selection of a system for 
inclusion in the plan based on the capability of the system to satisfy 
military requirements not met by the systems in the core program and on 
the capability of the system to use prior investments in technologies, 
infrastructure, and battle-management capabilities that are incorporated 
in, or associated with, the systems in the core program.
    (2) <<NOTE: Notice.>> The Secretary may not proceed with the 
development of a follow-on theater missile defense system beyond the 
Demonstration/Validation stage of development unless the Secretary 
designates that system as a part of the core program under this section 
and submits to the congressional defense committees notice of that 
designation. <<NOTE: Reports.>> The Secretary shall include with any 
such notification a report describing--
            (A) the requirements for the system and the specific threats 
        that such system is designed to counter;
            (B) how the system will relate to, support, and build upon 
        existing core systems;
            (C) the planned acquisition strategy for the system; and
            (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost for that 
        system and the effect of development and acquisition of such 
        system on Department of Defense budget projections.

    (e) Program Accountability Report.--(1) As part of the annual report 
of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization required by section 224 of 
Public Law 101-189 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note), the Secretary of Defense shall 
describe the technical milestones, the

[[Page 110 STAT. 231]]

schedule, and the cost of each phase of development and acquisition 
(together with total estimated program costs) for each core and follow-
on theater missile defense program.
    (2) As part of such report, the Secretary shall describe, with 
respect to each program covered in the report, any variance in the 
technical milestones, program schedule milestones, and costs for the 
program compared with the information relating to that program in the 
report submitted in the previous year and in the report submitted in the 
first year in which that program was covered.
    (f) <<NOTE: Certification.>> Reports on TMD System Limitations Under 
ABM Treaty.--(1) Whenever, after January 1, 1993, the Secretary of 
Defense issues a certification with respect to the compliance of a 
particular Theater Missile Defense system with the ABM Treaty, the 
Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of 
Representatives a copy of such certification. Such transmittal shall be 
made not later than 30 days after the date on which such certification 
is issued, except that in the case of a certification issued before the 
date of the enactment of this Act, such transmittal shall be made not 
later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

    (2) If a certification under paragraph (1) is based on application 
of a policy concerning United States compliance with the ABM Treaty that 
differs from the policy described in section 235(b)(1), the Secretary 
shall include with the transmittal under that paragraph a report 
providing a detailed assessment of--
            (A) how the policy applied differs from the policy described 
        in section 235(b)(1); and
            (B) how the application of that policy (rather than the 
        policy described in section 235(b)(1)) will affect the cost, 
        schedule, and performance of that system.
SEC. 235. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT AN 
                        INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT CONCERNING THEATER 
                        MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--(1) Congress hereby reaffirms--
            (A) the finding in section 234(a)(7) of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 107 
        Stat. 1595; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) that the ABM Treaty was not 
        intended to, and does not, apply to or limit research, 
        development, testing, or deployment of missile defense systems, 
        system upgrades, or system components that are designed to 
        counter modern theater ballistic missiles, regardless of the 
        capabilities of such missiles, unless those systems, system 
        upgrades, or system components are tested against or have 
        demonstrated capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic 
        missiles; and
            (B) the statement in section 232 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337; 108 
        Stat. 2700) that the United States shall not be bound by any 
        international agreement entered into by the President that would 
        substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is 
        entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the 
        President under the Constitution.

    (2) Congress also finds that the demarcation standard described in 
subsection (b)(1) for compliance of a missile defense system,

[[Page 110 STAT. 232]]

system upgrade, or system component with the ABM Treaty is based upon 
current technology.
    (b) Sense of Congress Concerning Compliance Policy.--It is the sense 
of Congress that--
            (1) unless a missile defense system, system upgrade, or 
        system component (including one that exploits data from space-
        based or other external sensors) is flight tested in an ABM-
        qualifying flight test (as defined in subsection (e)), that 
        system, system upgrade, or system component has not, for 
        purposes of the ABM Treaty, been tested in an ABM mode nor been 
        given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles and, 
        therefore, is not subject to any application, limitation, or 
        obligation under the ABM Treaty; and
            (2) any international agreement that would limit the 
        research, development, testing, or deployment of missile defense 
        systems, system upgrades, or system components that are designed 
        to counter modern theater ballistic missiles in a manner that 
        would be more restrictive than the compliance criteria specified 
        in paragraph (1) should be entered into only pursuant to the 
        treaty making powers of the President under the Constitution.

    (c) Prohibition on Funding.--Funds appropriated or otherwise made 
available to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1996 may not be 
obligated or expended to implement an agreement, or any understanding 
with respect to interpretation of the ABM Treaty, between the United

                   Subtitle B--Depot-Level Activities

SEC. 311. <<NOTE: 10 USC 2464 note.>> POLICY REGARDING PERFORMANCE OF 
            DEPOT-LEVEL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 
            DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense does not have a comprehensive 
        policy regarding the performance of depot-level maintenance and 
        repair of military equipment.
            (2) The absence of such a policy has caused the Congress to 
        establish guidelines for the performance of such functions.
            (3) It is essential to the national security of the United 
        States that the Department of Defense maintain an organic 
        capability within the department, including skilled personnel, 
        technical competencies, equipment, and facilities, to perform 
        depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment in 
        order to ensure that the Armed Forces of the United States are 
        able to meet training, operational, mobilization, and emergency 
        requirements without impediment.
            (4) The organic capability of the Department of Defense to 
        perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment 
        must satisfy known and anticipated core mainte

[[Page 110 STAT. 247]]

        nance and repair requirements across the full range of peacetime 
        and wartime scenarios.
            (5) Although it is possible that savings can be achieved by 
        contracting with private-sector sources for the performance of 
        some work currently performed by Department of Defense depots, 
        the Department of Defense has not determined the type or amount 
        of work that should be performed under contract with private-
        sector sources nor the relative costs and benefits of 
        contracting for the performance of such work by those sources.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that there is a 
compelling need for the Department of Defense to articulate known and 
anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements, to organize the 
resources of the Department of Defense to meet those requirements 
economically and efficiently, and to determine what work should be 
performed by the private sector and how such work should be managed.

    (c) <<NOTE: Reports.>> Requirement for Policy.--Not later than March 
31, 1996, the Secretary of Defense shall develop and report to the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National 
Security of the House of Representatives a comprehensive policy on the 
performance of depot-level maintenance and repair for the Department of 
Defense that maintains the capability described in section 2464 of title 
10, United States Code.

    (d) Content of Policy.--In developing the policy, the Secretary of 
Defense shall do each of the following:
            (1) Identify for each military department, with the 
        concurrence of the Secretary of that military department, those 
        depot-level maintenance and repair activities that are necessary 
        to ensure the depot-level maintenance and repair capability as 
        required by section 2464 of title 10, United States Code.
            (2) Provide for performance of core depot-level maintenance 
        and repair capabilities in facilities owned and operated by the 
        United States.
            (3) Provide for the core capabilities to include sufficient 
        skilled personnel, equipment, and facilities that--
                    (A) is of the proper size (i) to ensure a ready and 
                controlled source of technical competence and repair and

        repair workloads that is made in accordance with the 
        recommendation of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        Commission, under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act 
        of 1990, that such workloads be consolidated at Department of 
        Defense depots or private-sector facilities.

        travel of an employee on temporary duty, the relationship 
        between the cost of the travel and the value of the travel to 
        the accomplishment of the mission which necessitates the travel.

prescribe the rate on the basis of the best available estimate of risk 
and financial exposure, levels of subscription by members, and other 
relevant factors.

year of insurance coverage of an insured member shall be continued 
without change for subsequent years of insurance coverage, except that

member under the insurance program shall be deducted and withheld from

level of benefits for which the member is insured.
    ``(b) Advance Pay for Premium.--The Secretary concerned may advance 
to an insured member the amount equal to the first insurance premium 
payment due under this chapter. The advance may be paid out of 
appropriations for military pay. An advance to a member shall be 
collected from the member either by deducting and withholding the amount

member directly. No disbursing or certifying officer shall be 
responsible for any loss resulting from an advance under this 
subsection.
    ``(c) Premiums To Be Deposited in Fund.--Premium amounts deducted

sound basis.
    ``(b) Assets of Fund.--There shall be deposited into the Fund the 
following:
            ``(1) Premiums paid under section 12527 of this title.

    ``(c) Availability.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available for

    ``(d) Investment of Assets of Fund.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall invest such portion of the Fund as is not in the judgment of the 
Secretary of Defense required to meet current liabilities. Such 
investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable 
to the needs of the Fund, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, and 
bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding 
marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. 
The income on such investments shall be credited to the Fund.
    ``(e) Annual Accounting.--At the beginning of each fiscal year, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Board of Actuaries and the Secretary 
of the Treasury, shall determine the following:
            ``(1) The projected amount of the premiums to be collected, 
        investment earnings to be received, and any transfers or 
        appropriations to be made for the Fund for that fiscal year.

        unfunded liability (including any negative amount or any gain to 
        the Fund) resulting from payments of benefits.

        negative amount) of any cumulative actuarial gain or loss to the 
        Fund.

``Sec. 12529. Board of Actuaries

the actuarial responsibility for the insurance program.
    ``(b) Valuations and Premium Recommendations.--The Board of 
Actuaries shall carry out periodic actuarial valuations of the benefits 
under the insurance program and determine a premium rate methodology for 
the Secretary to use in setting premium rates for the insurance program. 
The Board shall conduct the first valuation and determine a premium rate 
methodology not later than six months after the insurance program is 
established.
    ``(c) Effects of Changed Benefits.--If at the time of any actuarial 
valuation under subsection (b) there has been a change in benefits under 
the insurance program that has been made since the last such valuation 
and such change in benefits increases or decreases the present value of 
amounts payable from the Fund, the Board of Actuaries shall determine a 
premium rate methodology, and recommend to the Secretary a premium 
schedule, for the liquidation of any liability (or actuarial gain to the 
Fund) resulting from such change and any previous such changes so that 
the present value of the sum of the scheduled premium payments (or 
reduction in payments that would otherwise be made) equals the 
cumulative increase (or decrease) in the present value of such benefits.
    ``(d) Actuarial Gains or Losses.--If at the time of any such 
valuation the Board of Actuaries determines that there has been an 
actuarial gain or loss to the Fund as a result of changes in actuarial 
assumptions since the last valuation or as a result of any differences, 
between actual and expected experience since the last valuation, the 
Board shall recommend to the Secretary a premium rate schedule for the 
amortization of the cumulative gain or loss to the Fund resulting from 
such changes in assumptions and any previous such changes in assumptions 
or from the differences in actual and expected experience, respectively, 
through an increase or decrease in the payments that would otherwise be 
made to the Fund.
    ``(e) Insufficient Assets.--If at any time liabilities of the Fund 
exceed assets of the Fund as a result of members of the Ready Reserve 
being ordered to active duty as described in section 12521(2) of this 
title, and funds are unavailable to pay benefits completely, the 
Secretary shall request the President to submit to Congress a request 
for a special appropriation to cover the unfunded liability. If 
appropriations are not made to cover an unfunded liability in any fiscal 
year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the benefits paid under 
the insurance program to a total amount that does not exceed the assets 
of the Fund expected to accrue by the end of such fiscal year. Benefits 
that cannot be paid because of such a reduction shall be deferred and 
may be paid only after and to the extent that additional funds become 
available.
    ``(f) Definition of Present Value.--The Board of Actuaries shall 
define the term `present value' for purposes of this subsection.

excess of 30 days of covered service shall be paid the amount to which

person designated under paragraph (1) be deposited with a bank or other 
financial institution to the credit of the designated person.

payable under the insurance program on account of a deceased member's 
period of covered service shall be paid, upon the establishment of a 
valid claim, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries which the deceased

amount shall be payable in accordance with the laws of the State of the 
member's domicile.

``Sec. 12531. Purchase of insurance

    ``(a) Purchase Authorized.--The Secretary may, instead of or in 
addition to underwriting the insurance program through the Fund, 
purchase from one or more insurance companies a policy or policies of 
group insurance in order to provide the benefits required under this

competition in order to purchase an insurance policy under this

issues a policy for purposes of subsection (a) shall establish an 
administrative office at a place and under a name designated by the 
Secretary.

    ``(2) For the purposes of carrying out this chapter, the Secretary

policy for purposes of subsection (a), may designate one such company as

company issuing any policy for purposes of subsection (a) to reinsure, 
under conditions approved by the Secretary, portions

        the reserve components of the Army and Air Force, to the extent

require the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force to

that the individual maintain membership in the Selected Reserve (so as 
to be a so-called `dual-status' technician) and shall require that the 
civilian and military position skill requirements of dual-status

is not a member of the Selected Reserve, except that compensation may be 
paid for up to six months following loss of membership in the Selected 
Reserve if such loss of membership was not due to the failure to meet 
military standards.''.

SEC. 522. <<NOTE: 10 USC 1130 note.>>  AUTHORITY TO AWARD 
                        DECORATIONS RECOGNIZING ACTS OF VALOR 
                        PERFORMED IN COMBAT DURING THE VIETNAM 
                        CONFLICT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, carried out by 
        the Armed Forces in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam from October 
        23, 1965, to November 26, 1965, is illustrative of the many 
        battles during the Vietnam conflict which pitted forces of the 
        United States against North Vietnamese Army regulars and Viet 
        Cong in vicious fighting.
            (2) Accounts of those battles that have been published since 
        the end of that conflict authoritatively document numerous and 
        repeated acts of extraordinary heroism, sacrifice, and bravery 
        on the part of members of the Armed Forces, many of which have 
        never been officially recognized.
            (3) In some of those battles, United States military units 
        suffered substantial losses, with some units sustaining 
        casualties in excess of 50 percent.
            (4) The incidence of heavy casualties throughout the Vietnam 
        conflict inhibited the timely collection of comprehensive and 
        detailed information to support recommendations for awards 
        recognizing acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery.
            (5) Subsequent requests to the Secretaries of the military 
        departments for review of award recommendations for such acts 
        have been denied because of restrictions in law and regulations 
        that require timely filing of such recommendations and 
        documented justification.
            (6) Acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery performed in 
        combat by members of the Armed Forces deserve appropriate and 
        timely recognition by the people of the United States.
            (7) It is appropriate to recognize acts of heroism, 
        sacrifice, or bravery that are belatedly, but properly, 
        documented by persons who witnessed those acts.

    (b) Waiver of Time Limitations for Recommendations for Awards.--(1) 
Any decoration covered by paragraph (2) may be awarded, without regard 
to any time limit imposed by law or regulation for a recommendation for 
such award to any person for actions by that person in the Southeast 
Asia theater of operations while serving on active duty during the 
Vietnam era. The waiver of time limitations under this paragraph applies 
only in the case of awards for acts of valor for which a request for 
consideration is submitted under subsection (c).
    (2) Paragraph (1) applies to any decoration (including any device in 
lieu of a decoration) that, during or after the Vietnam era and before 
the date of the enactment of this Act, was authorized by law or under 
regulations of the Department of Defense or the military department 
concerned to be awarded to members of the Armed Forces for acts of 
valor.
    (c) Review of Requests for Consideration of Awards.--(1) The 
Secretary of each military department shall review each request for

    (3) The Secretary may use the same process for carrying out the 
review as the Secretary uses for reviewing other recommendations for 
award of decorations to members of the Armed Forces under the 
Secretary's jurisdiction for valorous acts.
    (d) Report.--(1) Upon completing the review of each such request 
under subsection (c), the Secretary shall submit a report on the review 
to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on 
National Security of the House of Representatives.
    (2) The report shall include, with respect to each request for 
consideration received, the following information:
            (A) A summary of the request for consideration.

experience in that geographic area of such training to be knowledgeable

requirement specified in subsection (a) of section 4303 of title 10, 
United States Code, as added by subsection (a), the Secretary of the 
Army shall--
            (A) take such steps as necessary to accomplish that 
        requirement within 12 months after such date of enactment; and
            (B) submit to Congress, not later than 90 days after such

dangerous training activities (such as Ranger training, Search, Evasion, 
Rescue, and Escape (SERE) training, SEAL training, and Airborne 
training) must be adequately manned and resourced to ensure safety and 
effective oversight, it is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the 
        Secretaries of the military departments, should review and, if 
        necessary, enhance oversight of all such training activities; 
        and
            (2) that organizations similar to the safety cells required 
        to be established for Army Ranger training in section 4303 of

    ``(d) Policy for Implementing Reductions.--Whenever the Secretary of

means--

        title; and

fiscal year 1996, the number against which the percentage limitation of

SEC. 565. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING PERSONNEL TEMPO RATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Excessively high personnel tempo rates for members of 
        the Armed Forces resulting from high-tempo unit operations 
        degrades unit readiness and morale and eventually can be 
        expected to adversely affect unit retention.
            (2) The Armed Forces have begun to develop methods to 
        measure and manage personnel tempo rates.
            (3) The Armed Forces have attempted to reduce operations and 
        personnel tempo for heavily tasked units by employing 
        alternative capabilities and reducing tasking requirements.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--The Secretary of Defense should continue to 
enhance the knowledge within the Armed Forces of personnel tempo and to 
improve the techniques by which personnel tempo is defined and managed 
with a view toward establishing and achieving reasonable personnel tempo 
standards for all personnel, regardless of service, unit, or assignment.

                        PROGRAM OF INDIVIDUALIZED RESIDENTIAL 
                        MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

    (a) Program Required.--(1) During fiscal year 1996, the Secretary of 
Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries under

an on-going evaluation of the effectiveness of the TRICARE program in 
meeting the goals of increasing the access of covered beneficiaries 
under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, to health care and 
improving the quality of health care provided to covered beneficiaries, 
without increasing the costs incurred by the Government or covered 
beneficiaries. The evaluation shall specifically address--
            (1) the impact of the TRICARE program on military retirees 
        with regard to access, costs, and quality of health care 
        services; and
            (2) identify noncatchment areas in which the health

funded research and development center to conduct the evaluation 
required by subsection (a).

                        TRICARE PROGRAM FOR COVERED BENEFICIARIES 
                        WHO ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Medical care provided in facilities of the uniformed 
        services is generally less expensive to the Federal Government 
        than the same care provided at Government expense in the private 
        sector.
            (2) Covered beneficiaries under the military health care 
        provisions of chapter 55, United States Code, who are eligible 
        for medicare under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) deserve health care options that empower 
        them to choose the health plan that best fits their needs.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should develop a program to 
        ensure that such covered beneficiaries who reside in a region in 
        which the TRICARE program has been implemented con

[[Page 110 STAT. 377]]

        tinue to have adequate access to health care services after the 
        implementation of the TRICARE program; and
            (2) as a means of ensuring such access, the budget for 
        fiscal year 1997 submitted by the President under section 1105 
        of title 31, United States Code, should provide for 
        reimbursement by the Health Care Financing Administration to the 
        Department of Defense for health care services provided to such 
        covered beneficiaries in medical treatment facilities of the 
        Department of Defense.

                        AFFECTED BY CLOSURES OF MILITARY MEDICAL 
                        TREATMENT FACILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Military installations selected for closure in the 1991 
        and 1993 rounds of the base closure process will soon close.
            (2) Additional military installations have been selected for 
        closure in the 1995 round of the base closure process.
            (3) Some of the military installations selected for closure 
        include military medical treatment facilities.
            (4) As a result of these base closures, tens of thousands of 
        covered beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United 
        States Code, who reside in the vicinity of such installations 
        will be left without immediate access to military medical 
        treatment facilities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should take all appropriate steps necessary to ensure the 
continuation of medical and pharmaceutical benefits for covered

        and facilities performing under contracts with the Department of 
        Defense and subcontracts under such contracts.
            (3) The impact that the participation of the facility under

            (4) Such other factors as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.

        for programs carried out at the facility.
            (ii) A reduction of the schedule associated with programs 
        carried out at the facility.
            (iii) An increased use of commercial practices and 
        procedures for programs carried out at the facility.
            (iv) Protection of a domestic manufacturer competing for

                Act) in the case of commercial items,
        before the effective date of such provision (or amendment) to 
        the extent that the Secretary determines necessary to test the

            (1) The statutory provisions that as of the date of the 
        enactment of this Act govern the organization of the Office of 
        the Secretary of Defense have evolved from enactment of

[[Page 110 STAT. 400]]

        a number of executive branch legislative proposals and 
        congressional initiatives over a period of years.
            (2) The May 1995 report of the congressionally mandated 
        Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces included a 
        number of recommendations relating to the Office of the 
        Secretary of Defense.
            (3) The Secretary of Defense has decided to create a special 
        Department task force and to conduct other reviews to review 
        many of the Commission's recommendations.
            (4) The Secretary of Defense has decided to institute a 5 
        percent per year reduction of civilian personnel assigned to the 
        Office of the Secretary of Defense, including the Washington 
        Headquarters Service and the Defense Support Activities, for the 
        period from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001.

        Office and of the personnel needed to carry out those functions 
        is required.

            (1) An assessment of the appropriate functions of the Office 
        and whether the Office of the Secretary of Defense or some of 
        its component parts should be organized along mission lines.
            (2) An assessment of the adequacy of the present 
        organizational structure to efficiently and effectively support 
        the Secretary in carrying out his responsibilities in a manner 
        that ensures civilian authority in the Department of Defense.
            (3) An assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the 
        use of political appointees to fill the positions of the various 
        Under Secretaries of Defense, Assistant Secretaries of Defense, 
        and Deputy Under Secretaries of Defense.
            (4) An assessment of the extent of unnecessary duplication 
        of functions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense and 
        the Joint Staff.

        of functions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense and 
        the military departments.

        referred to in paragraph (3) and of Deputy Assistant Secretaries 
        of Defense.
            (7) An assessment of whether some or any of the functions 
        currently performed by the Office of Humanitarian and Refugee 
        Affairs are more properly or effectively performed by another 
        agency of Government or elsewhere within the Department of 
        Defense.

[[Page 110 STAT. 401]]

        Oversight Council and whether it is advisable or necessary to 
        establish a statutory charter for this organization.
            (9) An assessment of any benefits or efficiencies derived 
        from decentralizing certain functions currently performed by the 
        Office of the Secretary of Defense.
            (10) An assessment of the appropriate size, number, and 
        functional responsibilities of the Defense Agencies and other 
        Department of Defense support organizations.

    (c) Report.--Not later than March 1, 1996, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report containing 
--
            (1) his findings and conclusions resulting from the review

means military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense who

    (3) In carrying out reductions in the number of personnel assigned 
to, or employed in, the Office of the Department of Defense in order to 
comply with paragraph (1), the Secretary may not reassign functions 
solely in order to evade the requirement contained in that paragraph.
    (4) If the Secretary of Defense determines, and certifies to 
Congress, that the limitation in paragraph (1) would adversely affect 
United States national security, the limitation under paragraph (1) 
shall be applied by substituting ``80 percent'' for ``75 percent''.

        for which funds have been specifically provided in advance; or
            ``(B) the provision of humanitarian assistance, disaster

        control) for which funds have not been specifically provided in 
        advance.

    ``(2) This section applies to--
            ``(A) any operation the incremental cost of which is 
        expected to exceed $50,000,000; and
            ``(B) any other operation the expected incremental cost of

operation for the purposes of this section and shall promptly notify 
Congress of that designation (and of the identification of the 
operation).

    ``(4) This section does not provide authority for the President or 
the Secretary of Defense to carry out any operation, but establishes 
mechanisms for the Department of Defense by which funds are provided for 
operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some 
other authority.
    ``(b) Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units.--(1) The 
Secretary of Defense shall direct that, when a unit of the Armed Forces 
participating in an operation described in subsection (a) receives 
services from an element of the Department of Defense that operates 
through the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), such 
unit of the Armed Forces may not be required to reimburse that element 
for the incremental costs incurred by that element in providing such 
services, notwithstanding any other provision of law or any Government 
accounting practice.

[[Page 110 STAT. 416]]

would be required to be reimbursed to an element of the Department of 
Defense (or a fund) shall be recorded as an expense attributable to the

Department of Defense described in subsection (a), the Secretary of 
Defense may transfer amounts described

remain available for obligation, other than amounts within any operation 
and maintenance appropriation that are available for (A) an account 
(known as a budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for 
operating forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 
account) that is specified as being for mobilization.

any other authority provided by law authorizing the transfer of amounts 
available to the Department of Defense. However, the Secretary may not 
use any such authority under another provision of law for a purpose 
described in paragraph (1) if there is authority available under this 
subsection for that purpose.
    ``(5) The authority provided by this subsection to transfer amounts 
may not be used to provide authority for an activity that has been 
denied authorization by Congress.

authority of this subsection shall be deemed to increase the amount 
authorized for the account to which the amount is transferred by an 
amount equal to the amount transferred.

the Secretary of Defense identifies an operation pursuant to subsection 
(a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report that 
sets forth the following:
            ``(1) The manner by which the Secretary proposes to obtain 
        funds for the cost to the United States of the operation, 
        including a specific discussion of how the Secretary proposes to 
        restore balances in--
                    ``(A) the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a 
                successor fund), or
                    ``(B) the accounts from which the Secretary 
                transfers funds under the authority of subsection (c), 
                to the levels that would have been anticipated but for 
                the provisions of subsection (c).

        a justification why the budgetary resources of another 
        department or agency of the Federal Government, instead of 
        resources of the Department of Defense, are not being used for 
        carrying out the operation.
            ``(3) The objectives of the operation.

[[Page 110 STAT. 417]]

        operation.

    ``(e) Limitations.--(1) The Secretary may not restore balances in 
the Defense Business Operations Fund through increases in rates charged 
by that fund in order to compensate for costs incurred and not 
reimbursed due to subsection (b).
    ``(2) The Secretary may not restore balances in the Defense Business 
Operations Fund or any other fund or account through the use of 
unobligated amounts in an operation and maintenance appropriation that 
are available within that appropriation for (A) an account (known as a 
budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for operating 
forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 account) that is 
specified as being for mobilization.
    ``(f) Submission of Requests for Supplemental Appropriations.--It is 
the sense of Congress that whenever there is an operation described in 
subsection (a), the President should, not later than 90 days after the 
date on which notification is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(3), 
submit to Congress a request for the enactment of supplemental 
appropriations for the then-current fiscal year in order to provide 
funds to replenish the Defense Business Operations Fund or any other 
fund or account of the Department of Defense from which funds for the 
incremental expenses of that operation were derived under this section 
and should, as necessary, submit subsequent requests for the enactment 
of such appropriations.
    ``(g) Incremental Costs.--For purposes of this section, incremental 
costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the 
costs of the Department that are directly attributable to the operation 
(and would not have been incurred but for the operation). Incremental 
costs do not include the cost of property or services acquired by the 
Department that are paid for by a source outside the Department or out 
of funds contributed by such a source.
    ``(h) Relationship to War Powers Resolution.--This section may not 
be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution. This 
section does not provide authority to conduct any military operation.
    ``(i) GAO Compliance Reviews.--The Comptroller General of the United 
States shall from time to time, and when requested by a committee of 
Congress, conduct a review of the defense funding structure under this 
section to determine whether the Department of Defense is complying with 
the requirements and limitations of this section.''.
    (2) The item relating to section 127a in the table of sections at 
the beginning of chapter 3 of such title is amended to read as follows:

section 127a of title 10, United States Code, made by subsection (a) 
shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall 
apply to any

operation of the Department of Defense that is in effect on or after 
that date, whether such operation is begun before, on, or after such 
date of enactment. In the case of an operation begun before such date,

shall be treated as referring to the effective date under the preceding 
sentence.

SEC. 1013. CONTRACT OPTIONS FOR LMSR VESSELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A requirement for the Department of the Navy to acquire 
        19 large, medium-speed, roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels was 
        established by the Secretary of Defense in the Mobility 
        Requirements Study conducted after the Persian Gulf War pursuant 
        to section 909 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 1991 (Public Law 101-510; 104 Stat. 1623) and was 
        revalidated by the Secretary of Defense in the report entitled 
        ``Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update'', 
        submitted to Congress in April 1995.
            (2) The Strategic Sealift Program is a vital element of the 
        national military strategy calling for the Nation to be able to 
        fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional 
        contingencies.
            (3) The Secretary of the Navy has entered into contracts 
        with shipyards covering acquisition of a total of 17 such LMSR 
        vessels, of which five are vessel conversions and 12 are new

[[Page 110 STAT. 423]]

        construction vessels. Under those contracts, the Secretary has 
        placed orders for the acquisition of 11 vessels and has options 
        for the acquisition of six more, all of which would be new 
        construction vessels. The options allow the Secretary to place 
        orders for one vessel to be constructed at each of two shipyards 
        for award before December 31, 1995, December 31, 1996, and 
        December 31, 1997, respectively.
            (4) Acquisition of an additional two such LMSR vessels, for 
        a total of 19 vessels (the requirement described in paragraph 
        (1)) would contribute to preservation of the industrial base of 
        United States shipyards capable of building auxiliary and 
        sealift vessels.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Navy should plan for, and budget to provide for, the 
acquisition as soon as possible of a total of 19 large, medium-speed, 
roll-on/roll-off (LMSR) vessels (the number determined to be required in 
the Mobility Requirements Study referred to in subsection (a)(1)), 
rather than only 17 such vessels (the number of vessels under contract 
as of May 1995).
    (c) Additional New Construction Contract Option.--The Secretary of 
the Navy should negotiate with each of the two shipyards holding new 
construction contracts referred to in subsection (a)(3) (Department of 
the Navy contracts numbered N00024-93-C-2203 and N00024-93-C-2205) for 
an option under each such contract for construction of one additional 
such LMSR vessel, with such option to be available to the Secretary for 
exercise during 1995, 1996, or 1997, subject to the availability of 
funds authorized and appropriated for such purpose. Nothing in this 
subsection shall be construed to preclude the Secretary of the Navy from 
competing the award of the two options between the two shipyards holding 
new construction contracts referred to in subsection (a)(3).
    (d) Report.--The Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees, by March 31, 1996, a report stating 
the intentions of the Secretary regarding the acquisition of options for 
the construction of two additional LMSR vessels as described in 
subsection (c).

                subparagraph:

the provisions of section 3703a of title 46, United States Code.''.

Vessels.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated in section 302 for 
fiscal year 1996 for the National Defense Sealift Fund under section 
2218 of title 10, United States Code, not more than $20,000,000 shall be 
available for conversion work on the following two roll-on/roll-off 
vessels, which were acquired by the Maritime Administration during 
fiscal year 1995:
            (1) M/V Cape Knox (ON-1036323).
            (2) M/V Cape Kennedy (ON-1036324).

                      effective date of the regulations under subsection

                      election under this paragraph to be transferred 
                      back to a retirement system in which such 
                      individual previously participated (in this 
                      section referred to as the ``previous system''), 
                      all individual contributions (including interest) 
                      and Government contributions to the retirement 
                      system in which such individual is then currently 
                      participating (in this section referred to as the 
                      ``current system''), excluding those made to the 
                      Thrift Savings Plan or any other defined 
                      contribution plan, which are attributable to 
                      periods of service performed since the move on 
                      which the election is based, shall be paid
to the fund, account, or other repository for contributions made under 
the previous system. For purposes of this section, the term ``current 
system'' shall be considered also to include any retirement system 
(besides the one in which the individual is participating at the time of 
making the election) in which such individual previously participated 
since the move on which the election is based.
                          (ii) Condition subsequent relating to 
                      repayment of lump-sum credit.--In the case of an 
                      individual who has received such individual's 
                      lump-sum credit (within the meaning of section 
                      8401(19) of title 5, United States Code, or a 
                      similar payment) from such individual's previous 
                      system, the payment described in clause (i) shall 
                      not be made (and the election to which it relates 
                      shall be ineffective) unless such lump-sum credit 
                      is redeposited or otherwise paid at such time and 
                      in such manner as shall be required under 
                      applicable regulations. Regulations to carry out 
                      this clause shall include provisions for the 
                      computation of interest (consistent with section 
                      8334(e) (2) and (3) of title 5, United States 
                      Code), if no provisions for such computation 
                      otherwise exist.
                          (iii) Condition subsequent relating to 
                      deficiency in payments relative to amounts needed 
                      to ensure that benefits are fully funded.--
                                    (I) In general.--Except as provided 
                                in subclause (II), the payment described 
                                in clause (i) shall not be made (and the 
                                election to which it relates shall be 
                                ineffective) if the actuarial present 
                                value of the future benefits that would 
                                be payable under the previous system 
                                with respect to service performed by 
                                such individual after the move on which 
                                the election under this paragraph is 
                                based and before the effective date of 
                                the election, exceeds the total amounts 
                                required to be transferred to the 
                                previous system under the preceding 
                                provisions of this subparagraph with 
                                respect to such service, as determined 
                                by the authority administering such 
                                previous system (in this section 
                                referred to as the ``administrative 
                                authority'').
                                    (II) Payment of deficiency.--A 
                                determination of a deficiency under this 
                                clause shall not

[[Page 110 STAT. 437]]

                                render an election ineffective if the 
                                individual pays or arranges to pay, at a 
                                time and in a manner satisfactory to 
                                such administrative authority, the full 
                                amount of the deficiency described in 
                                subclause (I).
                    (D) Alternative election for an individual then 
                participating in fers.--
                          (i) Applicability.--This subparagraph applies 
                      with respect to any individual who--
                                    (I) is then currently participating 
                                in FERS; and
                                    (II) would then otherwise be 
                                eligible to make an election under 
                                subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this 
                                paragraph, determined disregarding the 
                                matter in subclause (I) of subparagraph 
                                (B) before the first semicolon therein.
                          (ii) Election.--An individual described in 
                      clause (i) may, instead of making an election for 
                      which such individual is otherwise eligible under 
                      this paragraph, elect to have all prior qualifying 
                      NAFI service of such individual treated as 
                      creditable service for purposes of any annuity

                      of this subparagraph, the term ``qualifying NAFI 
                      service'' means any service which, but for this 
                      subparagraph, would be creditable for purposes of 
                      any retirement system established for employees 
                      described in section 2105(c) of title 5, United 
                      States Code.
                          (iv) Service ceases to be creditable for nafi 
                      retirement system purposes.--Any qualifying NAFI 
                      service that becomes creditable for FERS purposes 
                      by virtue of an election made under this 
                      subparagraph shall not be creditable for purposes 
                      of any retirement system referred to in clause 
                      (iii).

                      similar to those set forth in subparagraph (C), to 
                      ensure that--
                                    (I) appropriate transfers of 
                                individual and Government contributions 
                                are made to the Civil Service Retirement 
                                and Disability Fund; and
                                    (II) the actuarial present value of 
                                future benefits under FERS attributable 
                                to service made creditable by such

                                in any retirement system established for 
                                employees described in section 2105(c) 
                                of title 5, United States Code (in this

small business concern, the small business concern shall have a period 
of not less than 120 days in which to arrange to meet its financial 
commitment requirements under the project from sources other than a 
person of a foreign country. If the Secretary determines upon the 
expiration of that period that the small business concern will be unable 
to meet its share of the anticipated project costs, the Secretary shall 
revoke the selection of the project proposal submitted by the small 
business concern.

            (1) September 2, 1995, marks the 50th anniversary of the 
        United States victory over Japan in World War II.
            (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in 
        the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces inflicted 
        such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the 
        battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again took the 
        offensive against United States or allied forces.
            (3) During the Battle of Midway, an outnumbered force of the 
        United States Navy, consisting of 29 ships and other units of 
        the Armed Forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral 
        Spruance, out-maneuvered and out-fought 350 ships of the 
        Imperial Japanese Navy.
            (4) It is in the public interest to erect a memorial to the 
        Battle of Midway that is suitable to express the enduring 
        gratitude of the American people for victory in the battle and 
        to inspire future generations of Americans with the heroism and 
        sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who achieved that 
        victory.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Midway Islands and the surrounding seas deserve to 
        be memorialized;
            (2) the historic structures related to the Battle of Midway 
        should be maintained, in accordance with the National Historic 
        Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470-470t), and subject to the 
        availability of appropriations for that purpose.
            (3) appropriate access to the Midway Islands by survivors of 
        the Battle of Midway, their families, and other visitors should 
        be provided in a manner that ensures the public health and

[[Page 110 STAT. 461]]

SEC. 1322. <<NOTE: 50 USC app. 2404 note.>> NATIONAL SECURITY 
                          IMPLICATIONS OF UNITED STATES EXPORT 
                          CONTROL POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Export controls remain an important element of the 
        national security policy of the United States.
            (2) It is in the national security interest that United 
        States export control policy be effective in preventing the 
        transfer, to potential adversaries or combatants of the United 
        States, of technology that threatens the national security or 
        defense of the United States.
            (3) It is in the national security interest that the United 
        States monitor aggressively the export of militarily critical 
        technology in order to prevent its diversion to potential 
        adversaries or combatants of the United States.
            (4) The Department of Defense relies increasingly on 
        commercial and dual-use technologies, products, and processes to 
        support United States military capabilities and economic 
        strength.
            (5) The maintenance of the military advantage of the United 
        States depends on effective export controls on dual-use items 
        and technologies that are critical to the military capabilities 
        of the Armed Forces.

    (b)  Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should evaluate license 
        applications for the export of militarily critical commodities 
        the export of which is controlled for national security reasons 
        if those commodities are to be exported to certain countries of 
        concern;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should identify the dual-use 
        items and technologies that are critical to the military 
        capabilities of the Armed Forces, including the military use 
        made of such items and technologies;
            (3) upon identification by the Secretary of Defense of the 
        dual-use items and technologies referred to in paragraph (2), 
        the President should ensure effective export controls or use 
        unilateral export controls on dual-use items and technologies 
        that are critical to the military capabilities of the Armed 
        Forces (regardless of the availability of such items or 
        technologies overseas) with respect to the countries that--
                    (A) pose a threat to the national security interests 
                of the United States; and
                    (B) are not members in good standing of bilateral or 
                multilateral agreements to which the United States is a 
                party on the use of such items and technologies; and
            (4) the President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of 
        Defense, should ensure effective controls on the re-export by 
        other countries of dual-use items and technologies that are 
        critical to the military capabilities of the Armed Forces.

    (c) <<NOTE: President.>> Annual Report.--(1) Not later than December 
1 of each year through 1999, the President shall submit to the 
committees specified in paragraph (4) a report on the effect of the 
export control policy of the United States on the national security 
interests of the United States.

    (2) The report shall include the following:
            (A) A list setting forth each country determined by the

                    (A) establish a list of enterprises controlled by 
                the People's Liberation Army, including those which have 
                been successfully converted to produce products solely 
                for civilian use; and
                    (B) provide estimates of the total revenues of those 
                enterprises.

SEC. 1401. REVISION OF DEFINITION OF LANDMINE FOR PURPOSES OF 
                          LANDMINE EXPORT MORATORIUM.

    Section 1423(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 107 Stat. 1832) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) as 
        subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), respectively;
            (2) in subparagraph (C), as so redesignated, by striking out 
        ``by remote control or'';

[[Page 110 STAT. 489]]

            (3) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``For purposes of''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

    ``(2) The term does not include command detonated antipersonnel land 
mines (such as the M18A1 `Claymore' mine).''.
SEC. 1402. REPORTS ON MORATORIUM ON USE BY ARMED FORCES OF 
                          ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES.

    Not later than April 30 of each of 1996, 1997, and 1998, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the projected effects of a moratorium on 
the defensive use of antipersonnel mines and antitank mines by the Armed 
Forces. The report shall include a discussion of the following matters:
            (1) The extent to which current doctrine and practices of 
        the Armed Forces on the defensive use of antipersonnel mines and 
        antitank mines adhere to applicable international law.
            (2) The effects that a moratorium would have on the 
        defensive use of the current United States inventory of remotely 
        delivered, self-destructing antitank systems, antipersonnel 
        mines, and antitank mines.
            (3) The reliability of the self-destructing antipersonnel 
        mines and self-destructing antitank mines of the United States.
            (4) The cost of clearing the antipersonnel minefields 
        currently protecting Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and 
        other United States installations.
            (5) The cost of replacing antipersonnel mines in such 
        minefields with substitute systems such as the Claymore mine, 
        and the level of protection that would be afforded by use of 
        such a substitute.
            (6) The extent to which the defensive use of antipersonnel 
        mines and antitank mines by the Armed Forces is a source of 
        civilian casualties around the world, and the extent to which 
        the United States, and the Department of Defense particularly, 
        contributes to alleviating the illegal and indiscriminate use of 
        such munitions.
            (7) The extent to which the threat to the security of United 
        States forces during operations other than war and combat 
        operations would increase as a result of such a moratorium.
SEC. 1403. EXTENSION AND AMENDMENT OF COUNTER-PROLIFERATION 
                          AUTHORITIES.

    (a) One-Year Extension of Program.--Section 1505 of the Weapons of 
Mass Destruction Control Act of 1992 (title XV of Public Law 102-484; 22 
U.S.C. 5859a) is amended--

                first place it appears and all that follows through the 
                period at the end of the second sentence and inserting 
                in lieu thereof ``for any fiscal year shall be derived 
                from amounts made available to the Department of Defense

                    (B) by striking out ``referred to in this 
                paragraph''; and

                following: ``, may not exceed $25,000,000 for fiscal 
                year 1994, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, or 
                $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1996''.
SEC. 1404. LIMITATION ON RETIREMENT OR DISMANTLEMENT OF STRATEGIC 
                          NUCLEAR DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, unless and 
until the START II Treaty enters into force, the Secretary of Defense 
should not take any action to retire or dismantle, or to prepare to 
retire or dismantle, any of the following strategic nuclear delivery 
systems:
            (1) B-52H bomber aircraft.
            (2) Trident ballistic missile submarines.
            (3) Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.
            (4) Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles.

    (b) Limitation on Use of Funds.--Funds available to the Department 
of Defense may not be obligated or expended during fiscal year 1996 for 
retiring or dismantling, or for preparing to retire or dismantle, any of

SEC. 1405. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING 
                          TREATY VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Reaffirmation of Prior Findings Concerning the Krasnoyarsk 
Radar.--Congress, noting its previous findings with respect to the large 
phased-array radar of the Soviet Union known as the ``Krasnoyarsk 
radar'' stated in paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 902(a) of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 
(Public Law 100-180; 101 Stat. 1135) (and reaffirmed in section 1006(a) 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 
(Public Law 101-189; 103 Stat. 1543)), hereby reaffirms those findings 
as follows:
            (1) The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits each 
        party from deploying ballistic missile early warning radars 
        except at locations along the periphery of its national 
        territory and oriented outward.
            (2) The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits each 
        party from deploying an ABM system to defend its national

[[Page 110 STAT. 491]]

        territory and from providing a base for any such nationwide 
        defense.
            (3) Large phased-array radars were recognized during 
        negotiation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as the critical 
        long lead-time element of a nationwide defense against ballistic 
        missiles.
            (4) In 1983 the United States discovered the construction, 
        in the interior of the Soviet Union near the town of 
        Krasnoyarsk, of a large phased-array radar that has subsequently 
        been judged to be for ballistic missile early warning and 
        tracking.

    (b) Further Reference to 1987 Congressional Statements.--Congress 
further notes that in section 902 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Public Law 100-180; 101 Stat. 1135) 
Congress also--
            (1) noted that the President had certified that the 
        Krasnoyarsk radar was an unequivocal violation of the 1972 Anti-
        Ballistic Missile Treaty; and
            (2) stated it to be the sense of the Congress that the 
        Soviet Union was in violation of its legal obligation under that 
        treaty.

    (c) Further Reference to 1989 Congressional Statements.--Congress 
further notes that in section 1006(b) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-189; 
103 Stat. 1543) Congress also--
            (1) again noted that in 1987 the President declared that 
        radar to be a clear violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 
        Treaty and noted that on October 23, 1989, the Foreign Minister 
        of the Soviet Union conceded that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a 
        violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; and
            (2) stated it to be the sense of the Congress that the 
        Soviet Union should dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar 
        expeditiously and without conditions and that until such radar 
        was completely dismantled it would remain a clear violation of 
        the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

    (d) <<NOTE: Y.V. Votintsev.>>  Additional Findings.--Congress also 
finds, with respect to the Krasnoyarsk radar, that retired Soviet 
General Y.V. Votintsev, Director of the Soviet National Air Defense 
Forces from 1967 to 1985, has publicly stated--
            (1) that he was directed by the Chief of the Soviet General 
        staff to locate the large phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk 
        despite the recognition by Soviet authorities that the location 
        of such a radar at that location would be a clear violation of 
        the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty; and
            (2) <<NOTE: D.F. Ustinov.>> that Marshal D.F. Ustinov, 
        Soviet Minister of Defense, threatened to relieve from duty any 
        Soviet officer who continued to object to the construction of a 
        large-phased array radar at Krasnoyarsk.

    (e) Sense of Congress Concerning Soviet Treaty Violations.--It is 
the sense of Congress that the government of the Soviet Union 
intentionally violated its legal obligations under the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to advance its national security 
interests.
    (f) Sense of Congress Concerning Compliance by Russia With Arms 
Control Obligations.--In light of subsections (a) through (e), it is the 
sense of Congress that the United States should remain vigilant in 
ensuring compliance by Russia with its

[[Page 110 STAT. 492]]

arms control obligations and should, when pursuing future arms control 
agreements with Russia, bear in mind violations of arms control 
obligations by the Soviet Union.
SEC. 1406. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RATIFICATION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
                          CONVENTION AND START II TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Proliferation of chemical or nuclear weapons materials 
        poses a danger to United States national security, and the 
        threat or use of such materials by terrorists would directly 
        threaten United States citizens at home and abroad.
            (2) Events such as the March 1995 terrorist release of a 
        chemical nerve agent in the Tokyo subway, the threatened use of 
        chemical weapons during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War, and the widespread use of chemical weapons during the Iran-
Iraq War of the 1980's are all potent reminders of the menace posed by 
chemical weapons, of the fact that the threat of chemical weapons is not 
sufficiently addressed, and of the need to outlaw the development, 
production, and possession of chemical weapons.
            (3) <<NOTE: George Bush.>> The Chemical Weapons Convention 
        negotiated and signed by President Bush would make it more 
        difficult for would-be proliferators, including terrorists, to 
        acquire or use chemical weapons, if ratified and fully 
        implemented, as signed, by all signatories.
            (4) <<NOTE: John Shalikashvili.>> United States military 
        authorities, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
        General John Shalikashvili, have stated that United States 
        military forces will deter and respond to chemical weapons 
        threats with a robust chemical defense and an overwhelming 
        superior conventional response, as demonstrated in the Persian 
        Gulf War, and have testified in support of the ratification of 
        the Chemical Weapons Convention.
            (5) The United States intelligence community has testified 
        that the Convention will provide new and important sources of 
        information, through regular data exchanges and routine and 
        challenge inspections, to improve the ability of the United 
        States to assess the chemical weapons status in countries of 
        concern.
            (6) The Convention has not entered into force for lack of 
        the requisite number of ratifications.
            (7) Russia has signed the Convention, but has not yet 
        ratified it.
            (8) There have been reports by Russian sources of continued 
        Russian production and testing of chemical weapons, including a 
        statement by a spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defense on 
        December 5, 1994, that ``We cannot say that all chemical weapons 
        production and testing has stopped altogether.''.
            (9) The Convention will impose a legally binding obligation 
        on Russia and other nations that possess chemical weapons and 
        that ratify the Convention to cease offensive chemical weapons 
        activities and to destroy their chemical weapons stockpiles and 
        production facilities.
            (10) The United States must be prepared to exercise fully 
        its rights under the Convention, including the request of 
        challenge inspections when warranted, and to exercise leadership 
        in pursuing punitive measures against violators of the 
        Convention, when warranted.

[[Page 110 STAT. 493]]

            (11) The United States should strongly encourage full 
        implementation at the earliest possible date of the terms and 
        conditions of the United States-Russia bilateral chemical 
        weapons destruction agreement signed in 1990.
            (12) The START II Treaty negotiated and signed by President 
        Bush would help reduce the danger of potential proliferators, 
        including terrorists, acquiring nuclear warheads and materials, 
        and would contribute to United States-Russian bilateral efforts 
        to secure and dismantle nuclear warheads, if ratified and fully 
        implemented as signed by both parties.
            (13) It is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to take effective steps to make it more difficult for 
        proliferators or would-be terrorists to obtain chemical or 
        nuclear materials for use in weapons.
            (14) The President has urged prompt Senate action on, and 
        advice and consent to ratification of, the START II Treaty and 
        the Chemical Weapons Convention.
            (15) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified 
        to Congress that ratification and full implementation of both 
        treaties by all parties is in the United States national 
        interest and has strongly urged prompt Senate advice and consent 
        to their ratification.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States, Russia, and all other parties to the START II Treaty and the 
Chemical Weapons Convention should promptly ratify and fully implement, 
as negotiated, both treaties.

SEC. 1407. IMPLEMENTATION OF ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS.

    (a) Funding.--Of the amounts appropriated pursuant to authorizations 
in sections 102, 103, 104, 201, and 301, the Secretary of Defense may

            (2) the President--
                    (A) issued or approved the policy before the date of 
                the enactment of this Act; or
                    (B) entered into an agreement on the policy with the 
                government of another country or approved an agreement

[[Page 110 STAT. 494]]

                on the policy entered into by an official of the United 
                States and the government of another country; and
            (3) the President has notified the designated congressional 
        committees of the policy or the policy agreement (as the case 
        may be), in writing, at least 30 days before the date on which 
        the President issued or approved the policy or has entered into

        510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).

        cities of Aurora, Colorado, and Denver, Colorado.
            (4) Reuse of the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center by the 
        communities in the vicinity of the center will ensure that the 
        center is fully utilized, thereby providing a benefit to such 
        communities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) determinations as to the use by other departments and 
        agencies of the Federal Government of buildings and property at 
        military installations approved for closure under the Defense 
        Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, including Fitzsimons 
        Army Medical Center, Colorado, should be completed as soon as 
        practicable;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should consider the expedited 
        transfer of appropriate facilities (including facilities that 
        remain operational) at such installations to the redevelopment 
        authorities for such installations in order to ensure continuity 
        of use of such facilities after the closure of such 
        installations, in particular, the Secretary should consider the 
        expedited transfer of the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center because 
        of the significant preparation underway by the redevelopment 
        authority concerned;
            (3) the Secretary should not enter into leases with 
        redevelopment authorities for facilities at such installations 
        until the Secretary determines that such leases fall within the 
        categorical exclusions established by the Secretary pursuant to 
        the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).

    (c) Report.--(1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report on the closure and 
redevelopment of Fitzsimons Army Medical Center.

        determinations.

    (b) Application of More Stringent Standards.--The head of a Federal 
agency may employ standards for the cost-effective security and privacy 
of sensitive information in a Federal computer system within or under 
the supervision of that agency that are more stringent than the 
standards promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce under this section, 
if such standards contain, at a minimum, the provisions of those 
applicable standards made compulsory and binding by the Secretary of 
Commerce.
    (c) Waiver of Standards.--The standards determined under subsection 
(a) to be compulsory and binding may be waived by the Secretary of 
Commerce in writing upon a determination that compliance would adversely 
affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal 
computer system, or cause a major adverse financial impact on the 
operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings. The Secretary 
may delegate to the head of one or more Federal agencies authority to 
waive such standards to the extent to which the Secretary determines 
such action to be necessary and desirable to allow for timely and 
effective implementation of Federal computer system standards. The head 
of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a Chief Information 
Officer designated pursuant to section 3506 of title 44, United States 
Code. <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>>  Notice of each such 
waiver and delegation shall be transmitted promptly to Congress and 
shall be published promptly in the Federal Register.

            (1) Joint public-private working group.--The Administrator, 
        in consultation with the Administrator for the Office of 
        Information and Regulatory Affairs, shall establish a joint 
        working group of Federal Government personnel and 
        representatives of the information technology industry to design 
        a plan for conduct of any pilot program carried out under this 
        section.
            (2) Content of plan.--The plan shall provide for use of 
        solutions-based contracting in the Department of Defense and not 
        more than two other executive agencies for a total of--
                    (A) not more than 10 projects, each of which has an 
                estimated cost of between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000; 
                and

        requirement in subparagraph (A), the solution for attainment of 
        the executive agency's objectives under the project should not 
        be obvious, but rather shall involve a need for some innovative 
        development and systems integration.
            (C) An acquisition project should not be so extensive or 
        lengthy as to result in undue delay in the evaluation of the use 
        of solutions-based contracting.

    (e) Monitoring by GAO.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
shall--
            (1) monitor the conduct, and review the results, of 
        acquisitions under the pilot program; and
            (2) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  submit to Congress periodic reports 
        containing the views of the Comptroller General on the 
        activities, results, and findings under the pilot program.

SEC. 5401. <<NOTE: 40 USC 1501.>>  ON-LINE MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE 
            CONTRACTING.

    (a) Automation of Multiple Award Schedule Contracting.--In order to 
provide for the economic and efficient procurement of information 
technology and other commercial items, the Administrator of General 
Services shall provide through the Federal Acquisition Computer Network 
(in this section referred to as ``FACNET''), not later than January 1, 
1998, Government-wide on-line computer

[[Page 110 STAT. 696]]

access to information on products and services that are available for 
ordering under the multiple award schedules. If the Administrator 
determines it is not practicable to provide such access through FACNET, 
the Administrator shall provide such access through another automated 
system that has the capability to perform the functions listed in 
subsection (b)(1) and meets the requirement of subsection (b)(2).
    (b) Additional FACNET Functions.--(1) In addition to the functions 
specified in section 30(b) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
Act (41 U.S.C. 426(b)), the FACNET architecture shall have the 
capability to perform the following functions:
            (A) Provide basic information on prices, features, and 
        performance of all products and services available for ordering 
        through the multiple award schedules.
            (B) Provide for updating that information to reflect changes 
        in prices, features, and performance as soon as information on 
        the changes becomes available.
            (C) Enable users to make on-line computer comparisons of the 
        prices, features, and performance of similar products and 
        services offered by various vendors.

    (2) The FACNET architecture shall be used to place orders under the 
multiple award schedules in a fiscal year for an amount equal to at 
least 60 percent of the total amount spent for all orders under the 
multiple award schedules in that fiscal year.
    (c) Streamlined Procedures.--
            (1) Pilot program.--Upon certification by the Administrator 
        of General Services that the FACNET architecture meets the 
        requirements of subsection (b)(1) and was used as required by 
        subsection (b)(2) in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year 
        in which the certification is made, the Administrator for 
        Federal Procurement Policy may establish a pilot program to test 
        streamlined procedures for the procurement of information 
        technology products and services available for ordering through 
        the multiple award schedules.
            (2) Applicability to multiple award schedule contracts.--
        Except as provided in paragraph (4), the pilot program shall be 
        applicable to all multiple award schedule contracts for the 
        purchase of information technology and shall test the following 
        procedures:
                    (A) A procedure under which negotiation of the terms 
                and conditions for a covered multiple award schedule 
                contract is limited to terms and conditions other than 
                price.
                    (B) A procedure under which the vendor establishes 
                the prices under a covered multiple award schedule 
                contract and may adjust those prices at any time in the 
                discretion of the vendor.
                    (C) A procedure under which a covered multiple award 
                schedule contract is awarded to any responsible offeror 
                that--
                          (i) has a suitable record of past performance, 
                      which may include past performance on multiple 
                      award schedule contracts;
                          (ii) agrees to terms and conditions that the 
                      Administrator determines as being required by law
or as being appropriate for the purchase of commercial items; and

[[Page 110 STAT. 697]]

                          (iii) agrees to establish and update prices, 
                      features, and performance and to accept orders 
                      electronically through the automated system 
                      established pursuant to subsection (a).
            (3) Comptroller general review and report.--(A) Not later 
        than three years after the date on which the pilot program is 
        established, the Comptroller General of the United States shall

        results of the pilot program.
            (B) The report shall include the following:
                    (i) An evaluation of the extent to which there is 
                competition for the orders placed under the pilot 
                program.
                    (ii) The effect that the streamlined procedures 
                under the pilot program have on prices charged under 
                multiple award schedule contracts.
                    (iii) The effect that such procedures have on 
                paperwork requirements for multiple award schedule 
                contracts and orders.
                    (iv) The impact of the pilot program on small 
                businesses and socially and economically disadvantaged 
                small businesses.
            (4) Withdrawal of schedule or portion of schedule from pilot 
        program.--The Administrator may withdraw a multiple award 
        schedule or portion of a schedule from the pilot program if the 
        Administrator determines that (A) price competition is not 
        available under such schedule or portion thereof, or (B) the 
        cost to the Government for that schedule or portion thereof for 
        the previous year was higher than it would have been if the 
        contracts for such schedule or portion thereof had been awarded 
        using procedures that would apply if the pilot program were not 
        in effect. <<NOTE: Notification.>>  The Administrator shall 
        notify Congress at least 30 days before the date on which the 
        Administrator withdraws a schedule or portion thereof under this 
        paragraph. The authority under this paragraph may not be 
        delegated.
            (5) Termination of pilot program.--Unless reauthorized by 
        law, the authority of the Administrator to award contracts under 
        the pilot program shall expire four years after the date on 
        which the pilot program is established. Contracts entered into 
        before the authority expires shall remain in effect in 
        accordance with their terms notwithstanding the expiration of 
        the authority to award new contracts under the pilot program.
