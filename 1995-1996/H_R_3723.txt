SEC. 401. <<NOTE: 42 USC 13751 note.>> ESTABLISHING BOYS AND GIRLS 
            CLUBS.

    (a) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
                    (A) the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, chartered 
                by an Act of Congress on December 10, 1991, during its 
                90-year history as a national organization, has proven 
                itself as a positive force in the communities it serves;
                    (B) there are 1,810 Boys and Girls Clubs facilities 
                throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the 
                United States Virgin Islands, serving 2,420,000 youths 
                nationwide;
                    (C) 71 percent of the young people who benefit from 
                Boys and Girls Clubs programs live in our inner cities 
                and urban areas;
                    (D) Boys and Girls Clubs are locally run and have 
                been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds 
                with private sector donations and maximizing community 
                involvement;
                    (E) Boys and Girls Clubs are located in 289 public 
                housing sites across the Nation;
                    (F) public housing projects in which there is an

                reduction in the presence of crack cocaine, a 22 percent 
                reduction in overall drug activity, and a 13 percent 
                reduction in juvenile crime;
                    (G) these results have been achieved in the face of 
                national trends in which overall drug use by youth has 
                increased 105 percent since 1992 and 10.9 percent of the

            (2) the term ``distressed area'' means an urban, suburban, 
        or rural area with a high percentage of high risk youth as 
        defined in section 509A of the Public Health Service Act (42 
        U.S.C. 290aa-8(f)).

    (c) Establishment.--
