        similar services, except that, if there are material differences

        frequency of use, the number of subscribers served, or the

106(6) shall not be taken into account in any administrative, judicial, 
or other governmental proceeding to set or adjust the royalties payable 
to copyright owners of musical works for the public performance of their 
works. It is the intent of Congress that royalties payable to copyright 
owners of musical works for the public performance of their works shall 
not be diminished in any respect as a result of the rights granted by 
section 106(6).
    ``(j) Definitions.--As used in this section, the following terms 
have the following meanings:
            ``(1) An `affiliated entity' is an entity engaging in 
        digital audio transmissions covered by section 106(6), other 
        than an interactive service, in which the licensor has any 
        direct or indirect partnership or any ownership interest 
        amounting to 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting or non-
        voting stock.
            ``(2) A `broadcast' transmission is a transmission made by a 
        terrestrial broadcast station licensed as such by the Federal 
        Communications Commission.
            ``(3) A `digital audio transmission' is a digital 
        transmission as defined in section 101, that embodies the 
        transmission of a sound recording. This term does not include 
        the transmission of any audiovisual work.
            ``(4) An `interactive service' is one that enables a member 
        of the public to receive, on request, a transmission of a 
        particular sound recording chosen by or on behalf of the 
        recipient. The ability of individuals to request that particular 
        sound recordings be performed for reception by the public at 
        large

[[Page 109 STAT. 344]]

        does not make a service interactive. If an entity offers both 
        interactive and non-interactive services (either concurrently or 
        at different times), the non-interactive component shall not be 
        treated as part of an interactive service.
            ``(5) A `nonsubscription' transmission is any transmission 
        that is not a subscription transmission.
            ``(6) A `retransmission' is a further transmission of an 
        initial transmission, and includes any further retransmission of 
        the same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a 
        transmission qualifies as a `retransmission' only if it is 
        simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in this 
        definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission that 
        fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify for an 
        exemption under section 114(d)(1).
            ``(7) The `sound recording performance complement' is the 
        transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel 
        used by a transmitting entity, of no more than--
                    ``(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings 
                from any one phonorecord lawfully distributed for public 
                performance or sale in the United States, if no more 
                than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; or
                    ``(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings--
                          ``(i) by the same featured recording artist; 
                      or
                          ``(ii) from any set or compilation of 
                      phonorecords lawfully distributed together as a 
                      unit for public performance or sale in the United 
                      States,
                if no more than three such selections are transmitted 
                consecutively:
        Provided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the 
        numerical limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from 
        multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound 
        recording performance complement if the programming of the 
        multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid the 
        numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.
            ``(8) A `subscription' transmission is a transmission that 
        is controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for 
        which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by 
        or on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a 
        package of transmissions including the transmission.
            ``(9) A `transmission' includes both an initial transmission 
        and a retransmission.''.

        division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate 
        common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive such 
        royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and

        authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates 
        prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through (F) and chapter 8 of 
        this title shall next be determined.
            ``(C) <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>> During the 
        period of June 30, 1996, through December 31, 1996, the 
        Librarian of Congress shall cause notice to be published in the 
        Federal Register of the initiation of voluntary negotiation 
        proceedings for the purpose of determining reasonable terms and 
        rates of royalty payments for the activities specified by

        established pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F), or such 
        other date (regarding digital phonorecord deliveries) as the

        between (i) digital phonorecord deliveries where the 
        reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to 
        the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord 
        delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord deliveries in general. 
        Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any 
        persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection 
        (a)(1) may submit to the Librarian of Congress licenses covering 
        such activities. The parties to each negotiation proceeding 
        shall bear their own costs.

        absence of license agreements negotiated under subparagraphs (B) 
        and (C), upon the filing of a petition in accordance with

        chapter 8, convene a copyright arbitration royalty panel to 
        determine and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of 
        rates and terms which, subject to subparagraph

        and (C). Such terms and rates shall distinguish between (i) 
        digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or 
        distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission 
        which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii) 
        digital phonorecord deliveries in general. In addition to the 
        objectives set forth in section 801(b)(1), in establishing such 
        rates and terms, the copyright arbitration royalty panel may 
        consider rates and terms under voluntary license agreements 
        negotiated as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C). The royalty 
        rates payable for a compulsory license for a digital phonorecord 
        delivery under this section shall be established de novo and no 
        precedential effect shall be given to the amount of the royalty

individual delivery of a phonorecord by digital transmission of a sound 
recording which results in a specifically identifiable reproduction by 
or for any transmission recipient of a phonorecord of that sound 
recording, regardless of whether the digital transmission is also a 
public performance of the sound recording or any nondramatic musical 
work embodied therein. A digital phonorecord delivery does not result 
from a real-time, non-interactive subscription transmission of a sound 
recording where no reproduction of the sound recording or the musical 
work embodied therein is made from the inception of the transmission 
through to its receipt by the transmission recipient in order to make 
the sound recording audible.''.
