        Agricultural Act of 1949 for the same fiscal year before the 
        effective date of this section.

[[Page 110 STAT. 915]]

            (2) Inclusion of california as separate order.--Upon the 
        petition and approval of California dairy producers in the

        manner provided in section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act 
        (7 U.S.C. 608c), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural 
        Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the Secretary shall designate 
        the State of California as a separate Federal milk marketing 
        order. The order covering California shall have the right to 
        reblend and distribute order receipts to recognize quota value.
            (3) Related issues addressed in consolidation.--Among the 
        issues the Secretary is authorized to implement as part of the 
        consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders are the 
        following:
                    (A) The use of utilization rates and multiple basing 
                points for the pricing of fluid milk.
                    (B) The use of uniform multiple component pricing 
                when developing 1 or more basic formula prices for 
                manufacturing milk.
            (4) Effect of existing law.--In implementing the 
        consolidation of Federal milk marketing orders and related 
        reforms under this subsection, the Secretary may not consider, 
        or base any decision on, the table contained in section 8c(5)(A) 
        of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c(5)(A)), 
        reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing 
        Agreement Act of 1937, as added by section 131 of the Food 
        Security Act of 1985.

                    (B) Final amendments.--The Secretary shall implement 
                the amendments not later than 3 years after the date of 
                enactment of this title.
            (3) Effect of court order.--The actions authorized by this 
        subsection are intended to ensure the timely publication and 
        implementation of new and amended Federal milk marketing orders. 
        In the event that the Secretary is enjoined or otherwise 
        restrained by a court order from publishing or implementing the 
        consolidation and related reforms under subsection (a), the 
        length of time for which that injunction or other restraining 
        order is effective shall be added to the time limitations 
        specified in paragraph (2) thereby extending those time

reduce the level of services provided under the section on account of 
the prohibition against assessments, but shall rather cover the cost of

the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department.

                peanuts handled under loan and for additional peanuts 
                placed under loan, except that separate pools shall be 
                established for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico.
                    (B) Eligibility to participate in new mexico

                      (ii), in the case of the 1996 and subsequent

                          (ii) Exception.--A producer of Valencia 
                      peanuts may enter Valencia peanuts that are 
                      produced in Texas into the pools of New Mexico in 
                      a quantity not greater than the average annual 
                      quantity of the peanuts that the producer entered 
                      into the New Mexico pools for the 1990 through 
                      1995 crops.
                    (C) Types of peanuts.--Bright hull and dark hull 
                Valencia peanuts shall be considered as separate types 
                for the purpose of establishing the pools.
                    (D) Net gains.--Net gains on peanuts in each pool, 
                unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, shall be 
                distributed only to producers who placed peanuts in the 
                pool and shall be distributed in proportion to the value 
                of the peanuts placed in the pool by each producer. Net 
                gains for peanuts in each pool shall consist of the 
                following:
                          (i) Quota peanuts.--For quota peanuts, the net 
                      gains over and above the loan indebtedness and 
                      other costs or losses incurred on peanuts placed 
                      in the pool.
                          (ii) Additional peanuts.--For additional 
                      peanuts, the net gains over and above the loan

                      peanuts placed in the pool for additional peanuts.

    (d) Losses.--Losses in quota area pools shall be covered using the 
following sources in the following order of priority:
            (1) Transfers from additional loan pools.--The proceeds due 
        any producer from any pool shall be reduced by the amount of any 
        loss that is incurred with respect to peanuts transferred from 
        an additional loan pool to a quota loan pool by the producer 
        under section 358-1(b)(8) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 
        1938 (7 U.S.C. 1358-1(b)(8)).
            (2) Producers in same pool.--Further losses in an area quota 
        pool shall be offset by reducing the gain of any producer in the 
        pool by the amount of pool gains attributed to the same producer 
        from the sale of additional peanuts for domestic and edible 
        export use.
            (3) Offset within area.--Further losses in an area quota 
        pool shall be offset by any gains or profits from additional 
        peanuts (other than separate type pools established under 
        subsection (c)(2)(A) for Valencia peanuts produced in New 
        Mexico) owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation 
        in that area and sold for domestic edible use, in accordance 
        with regulations issued by the Secretary. This paragraph shall 
        not apply to profits or gains from a farm with 1 acre or less of 
        peanut production.
            (4) First use of marketing assessments.--The Secretary shall 
        use funds collected under subsection (g) (except funds 
        attributable to handlers) to offset further losses in area quota 
        pools. The Secretary shall transfer to the Treasury those funds 
        collected under subsection (g) and available for use under this 
        paragraph that the Secretary determines are not required to 
        cover losses in area quota pools.

[[Page 110 STAT. 925]]

            (5) <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Cross compliance.--Further losses 
        in area quota pools, other than losses incurred as a result of 
        transfers from additional loan pools to quota loan pools under 
        section 358-1(b)(8) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 
        (7 U.S.C. 1358-1(b)(8)), shall be offset by any gains or profits 
        from quota pools in other production areas (other than separate 
        type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) for Valencia 
        peanuts produced in New Mexico) in such manner as the Secretary 
        shall by regulation prescribe.
            (6) Offset generally.--If losses in an area quota pool have 
        not been entirely offset under the preceding paragraphs, further 
        losses shall be offset by any gains or profits from additional 
        peanuts (other than separate type pools established under 
        subsection (c)(2)(A) for Valencia peanuts produced in New 
        Mexico) owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation 
        and sold for domestic edible use, in accordance with regulations 
        issued by the Secretary. This paragraph shall not apply to 
        profits or gains from a farm with 1 acre or less of peanut 
        production.
            (7) Second use of marketing assessments.--The Secretary 
        shall use funds collected under subsection (g) and attributable 
        to handlers to offset further losses in area quota pools. The 
        Secretary shall transfer to the Treasury those funds collected 
        under subsection (g) and available for use under this paragraph 
        that the Secretary determines are not required to cover losses 
        in area quota pools.
            (8) Increased assessments.--If use of the authorities 
        provided in the preceding paragraphs is not sufficient to cover 
        losses in an area quota pool, the Secretary shall increase the 
        marketing assessment for producers established under subsection 
        (g) by such an amount as the Secretary considers necessary to 
        cover the losses. The increased assessment shall apply only to 
        quota peanuts in the production area covered by the pool. 
        Amounts collected under subsection (g) as a result of the 
        increased assessment shall be retained by the Secretary to cover 
        losses in that pool.

    (e) Disapproval of Quotas.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, no loan for quota peanuts may be made available by the Secretary 
for any crop of peanuts with respect to which poundage quotas have been 
disapproved by producers, as provided for in section 358-1(d) of the 
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 1358-1(d)).
    (f) Quality Improvement.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to peanuts under loan, the 
        Secretary shall--
                    (A) promote the crushing of peanuts at a greater 
                risk of deterioration before peanuts of a lesser risk of 
                deterioration;
                    (B) ensure that all Commodity Credit Corporation 
                inventories of peanuts sold for domestic edible use must 
                be shown to have been officially inspected by licensed 
                Department inspectors both as farmer stock and shelled 
                or cleaned in-shell peanuts;
                    (C) continue to endeavor to operate the peanut 
                program so as to improve the quality of domestic peanuts 
                and ensure the coordination of activities under the 
                Peanut Administrative Committee established under

                601 et seq.), reenacted with amendments by the 
                Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937); and

                program as a result of this subsection requiring 
                additional production or handling at the farm level 
                shall be reflected as an upward adjustment in the 
                Department loan schedule.
            (2) Exports and other peanuts.--The Secretary shall require 
        that all peanuts in the domestic and export markets fully comply 
        with all quality standards under Marketing Agreement No. 146.

        1.2 percent for each of the 1997 through 2002 crops, of the

                      acquired multiplied by--
                                    (I) in the case of each of the 1994

                      amount equal to the quantity of peanuts acquired 
                      multiplied by .55 percent of the applicable

                    (B) Definition of first purchaser.--In this 
                subsection, the term ``first purchaser'' means a person 
                acquiring peanuts from a producer except that in the 
                case of peanuts forfeited by a producer to the Commodity 
                Credit Corporation, the term means the person acquiring 
                the peanuts from the Commodity Credit Corporation.
            (3) Other private marketings.--In the case of a private 
        marketing by a producer directly to a consumer through a retail 
        or wholesale outlet or in the case of a marketing by the 
        producer outside of the continental United States, the producer 
        shall be responsible for the full amount of the assessment and

        portion of the assessment shall be deducted from the proceeds of 
        the loan. The remainder of the assessment shall be paid by the 
        first purchaser of the peanuts. For purposes of computing net 
        gains on peanuts under this section, the reduction in loan 
        proceeds shall be treated as having been paid to the producer.
            (5) Penalties.--If any person fails to collect or remit the 
        reduction required by this subsection or fails to comply with 
        the requirements for recordkeeping or otherwise as are required 
        by the Secretary to carry out this subsection, the person shall 
        be liable to the Secretary for a civil penalty up to an amount 
        determined by multiplying--
                    (A) the quantity of peanuts involved in the 
                violation; by
                    (B) the national average quota peanut rate for the 
                applicable crop year.

        in the courts of the United States.

    (a) Operation and Administration of Program.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of an eligible crop described 
        in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall operate a 
        noninsured crop disaster assistance program to provide coverage 
        equivalent to the catastrophic risk protection otherwise 
        available under section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act 
        (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)). The Secretary shall carry out this section 
        through the Consolidated Farm Service Agency (in this section 
        referred to as the ``Agency'').
            (2) Eligible crops.--
                    (A) In general.--In this section, the term 
                ``eligible crop'' means each commercial crop or other 
                agricultural commodity (except livestock)--
                          (i) for which catastrophic risk protection 
                      under section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance 
                      Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b)) is not available; and

                    (B) Crops specifically included.--The term 
                ``eligible crop'' shall include floricultural, 
                ornamental nursery, and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass 
                sod, seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental 
                fish), and industrial crops.
            (3) Cause of loss.--To qualify for assistance under this 
        section, the losses of the noninsured commodity shall be due to 
        drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the 
        Secretary.

    (b) Application for Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance.--
            (1) Timely application.--To be eligible for assistance under 
        this section, a producer shall submit an application for 
        noninsured crop disaster assistance at a local office of the 
        Department. The application shall be in such form, contain such 
        information, and be submitted at such time as the Secretary may 
        require.
            (2) Records.--A producer shall provide records, as required 
        by the Secretary, of crop acreage, acreage yields, and 
        production.
            (3) Acreage reports.--A producer shall provide reports on 
        acreage planted or prevented from being planted, as required by 
        the Secretary, by the designated acreage reporting date for the 
        crop and location as established by the Secretary.

    (c) Loss Requirements.--
            (1) Required area loss.--A producer of an eligible crop 
        shall not receive noninsured crop disaster assistance unless the 
        average yield for that crop, or an equivalent measure in the 
        event yield data are not available, in an area falls below 65 
        percent of the expected area yield, as established by the 
        Secretary.

[[Page 110 STAT. 948]]

            (2) Prevented planting.--Subject to paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall make a prevented planting noninsured crop 
        disaster assistance payment if the producer is prevented from 
        planting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended for the 
        eligible crop because of drought, flood, or other natural 
        disaster, as determined by the Secretary.
            (3) Reduced yields.--Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary 
        shall make a reduced yield noninsured crop disaster assistance 
        payment to a producer if the total quantity of the eligible crop 
        that the producer is able to harvest on any farm is, because of 
        drought, flood, or other natural disaster as determined by the 
        Secretary, less than 50 percent of the expected individual yield 
        for the crop, as determined by the Secretary, factored for the 
        interest of the producer for the crop.

    (d) Payment.--The Secretary shall make available to a producer 
eligible for noninsured assistance under this section a payment computed 
by multiplying--
            (1) the quantity that is less than 50 percent of the 
        established yield for the crop; by
            (2)(A) in the case of each of the 1996 through 1998 crop 
        years, 60 percent of the average market price for the crop (or 
        any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); or
            (B) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop 
        years, 55 percent of the average market price for the crop (or 
        any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); by
            (3) a payment rate for the type of crop (as determined by 
        the Secretary) that--
                    (A) in the case of a crop that is produced with a 
                significant and variable harvesting expense, reflects 
                the decreasing cost incurred in the production cycle for 
                the crop that is--
                          (i) harvested;
                          (ii) planted but not harvested; and
                          (iii) prevented from being planted because of 
                      drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as 
                      determined by the Secretary); and
                    (B) in the case of a crop that is not produced with 
                a significant and variable harvesting expense, as 
                determined by the Secretary.

    (e) Yield Determinations.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish farm 
        yields for purposes of providing noninsured crop disaster 
        assistance under this section.
            (2) Actual production history.--The Secretary shall 
        determine yield coverage using the actual production history of 
        the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous 
        consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop 
        years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which 
        noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to 
        the average of the actual production history of the producer 
        during the period considered.
            (3) Assignment of yield.--If a producer does not submit 
        adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop 
        yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the 
        producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of

[[Page 110 STAT. 949]]

        the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect 
        actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the 
        Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations 
        issued by the Secretary based on production history 
        requirements.
            (4) Prohibition on assigned yields in certain counties.--
                    (A) In general.--
                          (i) Documentation.--If sufficient data are 
                      available to demonstrate that the acreage of a 
                      crop in a county for the crop year has increased 
                      by more than 100 percent over any year in the 
                      preceding 7 crop years or, if data are not 
                      available, if the acreage of the crop in the 
                      county has increased significantly from the 
                      previous crop years, a producer must provide such 
                      detailed documentation of production costs, acres 
                      planted, and yield for the crop year for which 
                      benefits are being claimed as is required by the 
                      Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the 
                      documentation provided is not sufficient, the 
                      Secretary may require documenting proof that the 
                      crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been 
                      marketed at a reasonable price.
                          (ii) Prohibition.--Except as provided in 
                      subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop 
                      on a farm located in a county described in clause

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) on a level playing field, United States producers are 
        the most competitive suppliers of agricultural products in the 
        world;
            ``(2) exports of United States agricultural products 
        accounted for $54,000,000,000 in 1995, contributing a net 
        $24,000,000,000 to the merchandise trade balance of the United 
        States and supporting approximately 1,000,000 jobs;
            ``(3) increased agricultural exports are critical to the 
        future of the farm, rural, and overall United States economy, 
        but the opportunities for increased agricultural exports are 
        limited by the unfair subsidies of the competitors of the United 
        States, and a variety of tariff and nontariff barriers to highly 
        competitive United States agricultural products;
            ``(4) international negotiations can play a key role in 
        breaking down barriers to United States agricultural exports;
            ``(5) the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture made 
        significant progress in the attainment of increased market 
        access opportunities for United States exports of agricultural 
        products, for the first time--
                    ``(A) restraining foreign trade-distorting domestic 
                support and export subsidy programs; and

                sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions;
        that should result in increased exports of United States 
        agricultural products, jobs, and income growth in the United 
        States;
            ``(6) the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture did not 
        succeed in completely eliminating trade distorting domestic 
        support and export subsidies by--
                    ``(A) allowing the European Union to continue 
                unreasonable levels of spending on export subsidies; and
                    ``(B) failing to discipline monopolistic state

                use

            ``(7) during the period 1996 through 2002, there will be 
        several opportunities for the United States to negotiate fairer 
        trade in agricultural products, including further negotiations 
        under the World Trade Organization, and steps toward possible 
        free trade agreements of the Americas and Asian-Pacific Economic 
        Cooperation (APEC); and
            ``(8) the United States should aggressively use these 
        opportunities to achieve more open and fair opportunities for 
        trade in agricultural products.

    ``(b) Goals of the United States in Agricultural Trade 
Negotiations.--The objectives of the United States with respect to 
future negotiations on agricultural trade include--
            ``(1) increasing opportunities for United States exports of 
        agricultural products by eliminating tariff and nontariff 
        barriers to trade;
            ``(2) leveling the playing field for United States producers 
        of agricultural products by limiting per unit domestic 
        production supports to levels that are no greater than those 
        available in the United States;
            ``(3) ending the practice of export dumping by eliminating 
        all trade distorting export subsidies and disciplining state 
        trading entities so that they do not (except in cases of bona 
        fide food aid) sell in foreign markets at prices below domestic 
        market prices or prices below their full costs of acquiring and

            (1) in negotiations to establish multilateral disciplines on 
        agricultural export credits and credit guarantees, the United 
        States should not agree to any arrangement that is incompatible 
        with the provisions of United States law that authorize 
        agricultural export credits and credit guarantees;
            (2) in the negotiations (which are held under the auspices 
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), 
        the United States should not reach any agreement that fails to 
        impose disciplines on the practices of foreign government 
        trading entities such as the Australian Wheat Board, the 
        Canadian Wheat Board, the New Zealand Dairy Board, and the 
        Australian Dairy Board; and
            (3) the disciplines should include greater openness in the 
        operations of the entities as long as the entities are 
        subsidized by the foreign government or have monopolies for 
        exports of a commodity that are sanctioned by the foreign 
        government.

        measurements supplied by a producer (including measurements 
        performed by a certified third party) shall be used by the 
        Secretary if the Secretary determines that the measurements 
        indicate that the residue level for the field meets the level

                a county or area committee determines that the 
                application of the producer's conservation system would 
                impose an undue economic hardship on the producer, the 
                committee shall provide the producer with relief to

SEC. 386. <<NOTE: 16 USC 2005b.>> CONSERVATION OF PRIVATE GRAZING LAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) private grazing land constitutes nearly \1/2\ of the 
        non-Federal land of the United States and is basic to the 
        environmental, social, and economic stability of rural 
        communities;
            (2) private grazing land contains a complex set of 
        interactions among soil, water, air, plants, and animals;
            (3) grazing land constitutes the single largest watershed 
        cover type in the United States and contributes significantly to 
        the quality and quantity of water available for all of the many 
        uses of the land;
            (4) private grazing land constitutes the most extensive 
        wildlife habitat in the United States;
            (5) private grazing land can provide opportunities for 
        improved nutrient management from land application of animal 
        manures and other by-product nutrient resources;
            (6) owners and managers of private grazing land need to 
        continue to recognize conservation problems when the problems 
        arise and receive sound technical assistance to improve or 
        conserve grazing land resources to meet ecological and economic 
        demands;
            (7) new science and technology must continually be made 
        available in a practical manner so owners and managers of

[[Page 110 STAT. 1018]]

        private grazing land may make informed decisions concerning 
        vital grazing land resources;
            (8) agencies of the Department with private grazing land 
        responsibilities are the agencies that have the expertise and 
        experience to provide technical assistance, education, and 
        research to owners and managers of private grazing land for the 
        long-term productivity and ecological health of grazing land;
            (9) although competing demands on private grazing land 
        resources are greater than ever before, assistance to private 
        owners and managers of private grazing land is currently limited 
        and does not meet the demand and basic need for adequately 
        sustaining or enhancing the private grazing land resources; and
            (10) private grazing land can be enhanced to provide many 
        benefits to all citizens of the United States through voluntary 
        cooperation among owners and managers of the land, local 
        conservation districts, and the agencies of the Department 
        responsible for providing assistance to owners and managers of 
        land and to conservation districts.

    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to authorize the 
Secretary to provide a coordinated technical, educational, and related 
assistance program to conserve and enhance private grazing land 
resources and provide related benefits to all citizens of the United 
States by--
            (1) establishing a coordinated and cooperative Federal, 
        State, and local grazing conservation program for management of 
        private grazing land;
            (2) strengthening technical, educational, and related 
        assistance programs that provide assistance to owners and 
        managers of private grazing land;
            (3) conserving and improving wildlife habitat on private 
        grazing land;
            (4) conserving and improving fish habitat and aquatic 
        systems through grazing land conservation treatment;
            (5) protecting and improving water quality;
            (6) improving the dependability and consistency of water 
        supplies;
            (7) identifying and managing weed, noxious weed, and brush 
        encroachment problems on private grazing land; and
            (8) integrating conservation planning and management 
        decisions by owners and managers of private grazing land, on a 
        voluntary basis.

    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the 
        Department of Agriculture.

        of Agriculture.

    (d) Private Grazing Land Conservation Assistance.--
            (1) Assistance to grazing landowners and others.--Subject to 
        the availability of appropriations for this section, the 
        Secretary shall establish a voluntary program to provide 
        technical, educational, and related assistance to owners and 
        managers of private grazing land and public agencies, through

[[Page 110 STAT. 1019]]

        local conservation districts, to enable the landowners, 
        managers, and public agencies to voluntarily carry out 
        activities that are consistent with this section, including--
                    (A) maintaining and improving private grazing land 
                and the multiple values and uses that depend on private

                      private grazing land resources;
                          (iii) harvesting, processing, and marketing 
                      private grazing land resources; and
                          (iv) identifying and managing weed, noxious 
                      weed, and brush encroachment problems;
                    (D) protecting and improving the quality and 
                quantity of water yields from private grazing land;
                    (E) maintaining and improving wildlife and fish 
                habitat on private grazing land;
                    (F) enhancing recreational opportunities on private

                education to owners and managers of private grazing 
                land, at the request of the owners and managers.

    (e) Grazing Technical Assistance Self-Help.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) there is a severe lack of technical assistance 
                for farmers and ranchers who graze livestock;
                    (B) Federal budgetary constraints preclude any 
                significant expansion, and may force a reduction of, 
                current levels of technical support; and
                    (C) farmers and ranchers have a history of 
                cooperatively working together to address common needs 
                in the promotion of their products and in the drainage 
                of wet areas through drainage districts.

                     TITLE V--AGRICULTURAL PROMOTION

             Subtitle A--Commodity Promotion and Evaluation

SEC. 501. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7401.>> COMMODITY PROMOTION AND EVALUATION.

    (a) Commodity Promotion Law Defined.--In this section, the term 
``commodity promotion law'' means a Federal law that provides for the 
establishment and operation of a promotion program regarding an 
agricultural commodity that includes a combination of promotion, 
research, industry information, or consumer information activities, is 
funded by mandatory assessments on producers or processors, and is 
designed to maintain or expand markets and uses for the commodity (as 
determined by the Secretary). The term includes--
            (1) the marketing promotion provisions under section 
        8c(6)(I) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 
        608c(6)(I)), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural 
        Marketing Agreement Act of 1937;

            (2) Public Law 89-502 (7 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.);
            (3) title III of Public Law 91-670 (7 U.S.C. 2611 et seq.);
            (4) Public Law 93-428 (7 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.);

            (17) subtitle D; or
            (18) subtitle E.

    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is in the national public interest and vital to the 
        welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to 
        maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets and 
        uses for agricultural commodities through industry-funded, 
        Government-supervised, generic commodity promotion programs 
        established under commodity promotion laws.
            (2) These generic commodity promotion programs, funded by 
        the agricultural producers or processors who most directly reap 
        the benefits of the programs and supervised by the Secretary of 
        Agriculture, provide a unique opportunity for producers and 
        processors to inform consumers about their products.
            (3) The central congressional purpose underlying each 
        commodity promotion law has always been to maintain and expand 
        markets for the agricultural commodity covered by the law, 
        rather than to maintain or expand the share of those markets 
        held by any individual producer or processor.
            (4) The commodity promotion laws were neither designed nor 
        intended to prohibit or restrict, and the promotion programs 
        established and funded pursuant to these laws do not prohibit or 
        restrict, individual advertising or promotion of the covered 
        commodities by any producer, processor, or group of producers or 
        processors.
            (5) It has never been the intent of Congress for the generic 
        commodity promotion programs established and funded by the 
        commodity promotion laws to replace the individual advertising 
        and promotion efforts of producers or processors.
            (6) An individual producer's or processor's own advertising 
        initiatives are typically designed to increase the share of the 
        market held by that producer or processor rather than to 
        increase or expand the overall size of the market.
            (7) In contrast, a generic commodity promotion program is 
        intended and designed to maintain or increase the overall demand 
        for the agricultural commodity covered by the program

[[Page 110 STAT. 1031]]

        and increase the size of the market for that commodity, often by 
        utilizing promotion methods and techniques that individual 
        producers and processors typically are unable, or have no 
        incentive, to employ.
            (8) The commodity promotion laws establish promotion 
        programs that operate as ``self-help'' mechanisms for producers 
        and processors to fund generic promotions for covered 
        commodities which, under the required supervision and oversight 
        of the Secretary of Agriculture--
                    (A) further specific national governmental goals, as 
                established by Congress; and
                    (B) produce nonideological and commercial 
                communication the purpose of which is to further the 
                governmental policy and objective of maintaining and 
                expanding the markets for the covered commodities.
            (9) While some commodity promotion laws grant a producer or 
        processor the option of crediting individual advertising 
        conducted by the producer or processor for all or a portion of 
        the producer's or processor's marketing promotion assessments, 
        all promotion programs established under the commodity promotion 
        laws, both those programs that permit credit for individual 
        advertising and those programs that do not contain such 
        provisions, are very narrowly tailored to fulfill the 
        congressional purposes of the commodity promotion laws without 
        impairing or infringing the legal or constitutional rights of 
        any individual producer or processor.
            (10) These generic commodity promotion programs are of 
        particular benefit to small producers who often lack the 
        resources or market power to advertise on their own and who are 
        otherwise often unable to benefit from the economies of scale 
        available in promotion and advertising.
            (11) Periodic independent evaluation of the effectiveness of 
        these generic commodity promotion programs will assist Congress 
        and the Secretary of Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives 
        of the programs are met.

    (c) Independent Evaluation of Promotion Program Effectiveness.--
Except as otherwise provided by law, each commodity board established 
under the supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture 
pursuant to a commodity promotion law shall, not less often than every 5 
years, authorize and fund, from funds otherwise available to the board, 
an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic commodity 
promotion programs and other programs conducted by the board pursuant to 
a commodity promotion law. <<NOTE: Public information.>> The board shall 
submit to the Secretary, and make available to the public, the results 
of each periodic independent evaluation conducted under this subsection.

    (d) Administrative Costs.--The Secretary shall annually provide to 
the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate 
information on administrative expenses on programs established under 
commodity promotion laws.

Subtitle B <<NOTE: Commodity Promotion, Research, and Information Act of 
 1996.>> --Issuance of Orders for Promotion, Research, and Information 
Activities Regarding Agricultural Commodities

SEC. 511. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7401 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Commodity Promotion, Research, 
and Information Act of 1996''.

SEC. 512. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7411.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The production of agricultural commodities plays a 
        significant role in the economy of the United States. Thousands 
        of producers in the United States are involved in the production 
        of agricultural commodities, and such commodities are consumed 
        by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign 
        countries.
            (2) Agricultural commodities must be of high quality, 
        readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to 
        ensure that consumers have an adequate supply.
            (3) The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and 
        the development of new markets for agricultural commodities 
        through generic commodity promotion, research, and information 
        programs are vital to the welfare of persons engaged in the 
        production, marketing, and consumption of such commodities, as 
        well as to the general economy of the United States.
            (4) Generic promotion, research, and information activities 
        for agricultural commodities play a unique role in advancing the 
        demand for such commodities, since such activities increase the 
        total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and all 
        producers. These generic activities complement branded 
        advertising initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the 
        market share of individual competitors, and are of particular 
        benefit to small producers who lack the resources or market 
        power to advertise on their own. These generic activities do not 
        impede the branded advertising efforts of individual firms, but 
        instead increase general market demand for an agricultural 
        commodity using methods that individual companies do not have 
        the incentive to employ.
            (5) Generic promotion, research, and information activities 
        for agricultural commodities, paid by the producers and others 
        in the industry who reap the benefits of such activities, 
        provide a unique opportunity for producers to inform consumers 
        about a particular agricultural commodity.
            (6) It is important to ensure that generic promotion, 
        research, and information activities for agricultural 
        commodities be carried out in an effective and coordinated 
        manner designed to strengthen the position of the commodities in 
        the marketplace and to maintain and expand their markets and 
        uses. Independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic 
        promotion activities of these programs will assist the Secretary 
        of Agriculture and Congress in ensuring that these objectives 
        are met.

[[Page 110 STAT. 1033]]

            (7) The cooperative development, financing, and 
        implementation of a coordinated national program of research, 
        promotion, and information regarding agricultural commodities 
        are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and to 
        develop new markets for these commodities.
            (8) Agricultural commodities move in interstate and foreign 
        commerce, and agricultural commodities and their products that 
        do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or 
        affect interstate commerce in agricultural commodities and their 
        products.
            (9) Commodity promotion programs have the ability to provide 
        significant conservation benefits to producers and the public.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to authorize the 
establishment, through the exercise by the Secretary of Agriculture of 
the authority provided in this subtitle, of an orderly program for 
developing, financing, and carrying out an effective, continuous, and 
coordinated program of generic promotion, research, and information 
regarding agricultural commodities designed to--
            (1) strengthen the position of agricultural commodity 
        industries in the marketplace;
            (2) maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign 
        markets and uses for agricultural commodities;
            (3) develop new markets and uses for agricultural 
        commodities; or
            (4) assist producers in meeting their conservation 
        objectives.

    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this subtitle provides for the 
control of production or otherwise limits the right of any person to 
produce, handle, or import an agricultural commodity.

SEC. 531. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7401 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Canola and Rapeseed Research, 
Promotion, and Consumer Information Act''.

SEC. 532. <<NOTE: 7 USC 7441.>>  FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) canola and rapeseed products are an important and 
        nutritious part of the human diet;
            (2) the production of canola and rapeseed products plays a 
        significant role in the economy of the United States in that--
                    (A) canola and rapeseed products are produced by 
                thousands of canola and rapeseed producers and processed 
                by numerous processing entities; and
                    (B) canola and rapeseed products produced in the 
                United States are consumed by people throughout the 
                United States and foreign countries;
            (3) canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed products 
        should be readily available and marketed efficiently to ensure 
        that consumers have an adequate supply of canola and rapeseed 
        products at a reasonable price;
            (4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and 
        development of new markets for canola, rapeseed, and canola and 
        rapeseed products are vital to the welfare of canola and 
        rapeseed producers and processors and those persons concerned 
        with marketing canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed 
        products, as well as to the general economy of the United 
        States, and are necessary to ensure the ready availability and 
        efficient marketing of canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed 
        products;
            (5) there exist established State and national organizations 
        conducting canola and rapeseed research, promotion, and consumer 
        education programs that are valuable to the efforts of promoting 
        the consumption of canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed 
        products;
            (6) the cooperative development, financing, and 
        implementation of a coordinated national program of canola and 
        rapeseed research, promotion, consumer information, and industry 
        information is necessary to maintain and expand existing markets 
        and develop new markets for canola, rapeseed, and canola and 
        rapeseed products; and
            (7) canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed products move 
        in interstate and foreign commerce, and canola, rapeseed,

[[Page 110 STAT. 1049]]

        and canola and rapeseed products that do not move in interstate 
        or foreign commerce directly burden or affect interstate 
        commerce in canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed products.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of this subtitle to establish an 
orderly procedure for developing, financing through assessments on 
domestically produced canola and rapeseed, and implementing a program of 
research, promotion, consumer information, and industry information 
designed to strengthen the position in the marketplace of the canola and 
rapeseed industry, to maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign 
markets and uses for canola, rapeseed, and canola and rapeseed products, 
and to develop new markets and uses for canola, rapeseed, and canola and 
rapeseed products.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this subtitle provides for the control 
of production or otherwise limits the right of individual producers to 
produce canola, rapeseed, or canola or rapeseed products.

        vital to the welfare of processors and persons concerned with 
        marketing, using, and producing popcorn for the market, as well 
        as to the agricultural economy of the United States;
            (5) the cooperative development, financing, and 
        implementation of a coordinated program of popcorn promotion, 
        research, consumer information, and industry information is 
        necessary to maintain and expand markets for popcorn; and
            (6) popcorn moves in interstate and foreign commerce, and 
        popcorn that does not move in those channels of commerce 
        directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in popcorn.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that it is in the public 
interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the 
powers provided in this subtitle, of an orderly procedure for 
developing, financing (through adequate assessments on unpopped popcorn

coordinated program of promotion, research, consumer information, and 
industry information designed to--
            (1) strengthen the position of the popcorn industry in the 
        marketplace; and
            (2) maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and 
        uses for popcorn.

    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are to--
            (1) maintain and expand the markets for all popcorn products 
        in a manner that--
                    (A) is not designed to maintain or expand any 
                individual share of a producer or processor of the 
                market;
                    (B) does not compete with or replace individual 
                advertising or promotion efforts designed to promote 
                individual brand name or trade name popcorn products; 
                and
                    (C) authorizes and funds programs that result in 
                government speech promoting government objectives; and
            (2) establish a nationally coordinated program for popcorn 
        promotion, research, consumer information, and industry 
        information.

    (d) Statutory Construction.--This subtitle treats processors 
equitably. Nothing in this subtitle--
            (1) provides for the imposition of a trade barrier to the 
        entry into the United States of imported popcorn for the 
        domestic market; or
            (2) provides for the control of production or otherwise 
        limits the right of any individual processor to produce popcorn.

            ``(1) Although medical researchers in recent years have 
        demonstrated that there are several naturally occurring 
        compounds in many vegetables and fruits that can aid in the 
        prevention of certain forms of cancer, coronary heart disease, 
        stroke, and atherosclerosis, there has been almost no research 
        conducted to enhance these compounds in food plants by modern 
        breeding and molecular genetic methods.
            ``(2) By linking the appropriate medical and agricultural 
        research scientists in a highly-focused, targeted research 
        program, it should be possible to develop new varieties of 
        vegetables and fruits that would provide greater prevention of 
        diet-related diseases that are a major cause of death in the 
        United States.

    ``(b) Pilot Research Program.--The Secretary shall conduct, through 
the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, a 
pilot research program to link major cancer and heart and other 
circulatory disease research efforts with agricultural research efforts 
to identify compounds in vegetables and fruits that prevent these 
diseases. Using information derived from such combined research efforts, 
the Secretary shall assist in the development of new varieties of 
vegetables and fruits having enhanced therapeutic properties for disease 
prevention.
    ``(c) Agreements.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program 
through agreements entered into with land-grant colleges or 
universities, other universities, State agricultural experiment 
stations, the State cooperative extension services, nonprofit 
organizations with demonstrable expertise, or Federal or State 
governmental entities. The Secretary shall enter into the agreements on 
a competitive basis.

        health and productivity of domestic livestock, poultry, aquatic 
        animals, and other income-producing animals that are essential 
        to the food supply of the United States and the welfare of 
        producers and consumers of animal products;
            ``(2) improve the health of horses;
            ``(3) facilitate the effective treatment of, and, to the 
        extent possible, prevent animal and poultry diseases in both 
        domesticated and wild animals that, if not controlled, would be 
        disastrous to the United States livestock and poultry industries 
        and endanger the food supply of the United States;
            ``(4) improve methods for the control of organisms and 
        residues in food products of animal origin that could endanger 
        the human food supply;
            ``(5) improve the housing and management of animals to

            ``(1) the total animal health and disease research and 
        extension efforts of State colleges and universities and of the 
        Federal Government would be more effective if there were close 
        coordination between the efforts; and

        colleges of veterinary medicine and State agricultural 
        experiment stations that conduct animal health and disease 
        research are especially vital in training research workers in 
        animal health and related disciplines.''.
