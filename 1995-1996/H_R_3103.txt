        offer coverage in such market in accordance with subsection (c) 
        and applicable State law.

applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is 
made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group

of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health 
insurance coverage for a policy form offered to individuals in the 
individual market so long as such modification is consistent with State 
law and effective on a uniform basis among all individuals with that 
policy form.

applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is 
made available by a health insurance issuer in the individual market to 
individuals only through one or more associations, a reference to an

                insurance issuers of providing access to out-of-network 
                providers, and the potential impact of providing such 
                access on the cost and quality of health insurance

                        FREE CLINICS.

    Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 233) is 
amended by adding at the end the following subsection:
    ``(o)(1) For purposes of this section, a free clinic health 
professional shall in providing a qualifying health service to an 
individual be deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service for 
a calendar year that begins during a fiscal year for which a transfer 
was made under paragraph (6)(D). The preceding sentence is subject to 
the provisions of this subsection.
    ``(2) In providing a health service to an individual, a health care 
practitioner shall for purposes of this subsection be considered to be a 
free clinic health professional if the following conditions are met:

        under any Federal or State health benefits program). With 
        respect to compliance with such condition:

                donations for the provision of the service by the health 
                care practitioner to the individual.

        practitioner or the free clinic provides written notice to the 
        individual of the extent to which the legal liability of the 
        health care practitioner is limited pursuant to this subsection 
        (or in the case of an emergency, the written notice is provided 
        to the individual as soon after the emergency as is 
        practicable). If the individual is a minor or is otherwise 
        legally incompetent, the condition under this subparagraph is 
        that the written notice be provided to a legal guardian or other 
        person with legal responsibility for the care of the individual.
            ``(F) At the time the service is provided, the health care 
        practitioner is licensed or certified in accordance with 
        applicable law regarding the provision of the service.

    ``(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term `free clinic' 
means a health care facility operated by a nonprofit private entity 
meeting the following requirements:
            ``(i) The entity does not, in providing health services 
        through the facility, accept reimbursement from any third-party 
        payor (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or 
        health plan, or under any Federal or State health benefits 
        program).
            ``(ii) The entity, in providing health services through the 
        facility, either does not impose charges on the individuals to 
        whom the services are provided, or imposes a charge according to 
        the ability of the individual involved to pay the charge.
            ``(iii) The entity is licensed or certified in accordance 
        with applicable law regarding the provision of health services.

service' means any medical assistance required or authorized to be 
provided in the program under title XIX of the Social Security Act, 
without regard to whether the medical assistance is included in the plan 
submitted under such program by the State in which the health care 
practitioner involved provides the medical assistance. References in the 
preceding sentence to such program shall as applicable be considered to 
be references to any successor to such program.
    ``(5) Subsection (g) (other than paragraphs (3) through (5)) and 
subsections (h), (i), and (l) apply to a health care practitioner for 
purposes of this subsection to the same extent and in the same manner as 
such subsections apply to an officer, governing board member, employee, 
or contractor of an entity described in subsection (g)(4), subject to 
paragraph (6) and subject to the 
following:

        free clinic to be an employee of the Public Health Service for 
        purposes of this section.

        practitioner is not a free clinic health professional unless the 
        free clinic sponsors the health care practitioner. For purposes 
        of this subsection, the free clinic shall be considered to be 
        sponsoring the health care practitioner if--
                    ``(i) with respect to the health care practitioner, 
                the free clinic submits to the Secretary an application

                Service.
            ``(D) In the case of a health care practitioner who is 
        determined by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (g)(1)(E) to

        the health care practitioner (with respect to the free clinic 
        sponsoring the health care practitioner pursuant to subparagraph 
        (C)) for any cause of action arising from an act or omission of 
        the health care practitioner
occurring on or after the date on which the Secretary makes such 
determination.
            ``(E) Subsection (g)(1)(F) applies to a health care 
        practitioner for purposes of this subsection only to the extent 
        that, in providing health services to an individual, each of the

    ``(6)(A) For purposes of making payments for judgments against the 
United States (together with related fees and expenses of witnesses) 
pursuant to this section arising from the acts or omissions of free 
clinic health professionals, there is authorized to be appropriated 
$10,000,000 for each fiscal year.
    ``(B) The Secretary shall establish a fund for purposes of this 
subsection. Each fiscal year amounts appropriated under subparagraph (A) 
shall be deposited in such fund.
    ``(C) Not later <<NOTE: Reports.>>  than May 1 of each fiscal year, 
the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, shall submit 
to the Congress a report providing an estimate of the amount of claims

of the acts or omissions of free clinic health professionals, will be 
paid pursuant to this section during the calendar year that begins in 
the following fiscal year. Subsection (k)(1)(B) applies to the estimate 
under the preceding sentence regarding free clinic health professionals

members, employees, and contractors of entities described in subsection 
(g)(4).

subject to the extent of amounts in the fund.
    ``(7)(A) This <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  subsection takes effect on

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996--

SEC. 195. FINDINGS; <<NOTE: 42 USC 300gg note.>>  SEVERABILITY.

    (a) Findings Relating to Exercise of Commerce Clause Authority.--
Congress finds the following in relation to the provisions of this 
title:
            (1) Provisions in group health plans and health insurance 
        coverage that impose certain preexisting condition exclusions 
        impact the ability of employees to seek employment in interstate 
        commerce, thereby impeding such commerce.
            (2) Health insurance coverage is commercial in nature and is 
        in and affects interstate commerce.
            (3) It is a necessary and proper exercise of Congressional 
        authority to impose requirements under this title on group 
        health plans and health insurance coverage (including coverage 
        offered to individuals previously covered under group health 
        plans) in order to promote commerce among the States.
            (4) Congress, however, intends to defer to States, to the 
        maximum extent practicable, in carrying out such requirements 
        with respect to insurers and health maintenance organizations 
        that are subject to State regulation, consistent with the 
        provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
        1974.

    (b) Severability.--If any provision of this title or the application 
of such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be 
unconstitutional, the remainder of this title and the application of the 
provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected 
thereby.

directly related to receipt of health care or payment for health care or 
action involving a fraudulent claim related to health; or if authorized 
by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction, granted 
after application showing good cause therefor.

        described in subsection (b).
            (2) Preemption.--A regulation promulgated under paragraph

        requirements, standards, or implementation specifications 
        imposed under the regulation.

   Subtitle G--Duplication and Coordination of Medicare-Related Plans

SEC. 271. DUPLICATION AND COORDINATION OF MEDICARE-RELATED PLANS.

    (a) Treatment of Certain Health Insurance Policies as 
Nonduplicative.--Section 1882(d)(3)(A) (42 U.S.C. 1395ss(d)(3)(A)) is 
amended--
            (1) in clause (iii), by striking ``clause (i)'' and 
        inserting ``clause (i)(II)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

    ``(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance policy 
(other than a Medicare supplemental policy) providing for benefits which 
are payable to or on behalf of an individual without regard to other 
health benefit coverage of such individual is not considered to 
`duplicate' any health benefits under this title, under title XIX, or 
under a health insurance policy, and subclauses (I) and (III) of clause 
(i) do not apply to such a policy.
    ``(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance policy 
(or a rider to an insurance contract which is not a health insurance 
policy) is not considered to `duplicate' health benefits under this 
title or under another health insurance policy if it--
            ``(I) provides health care benefits only for long-term care, 
        nursing home care, home health care, or community-based care, or 
        any combination thereof,
            ``(II) coordinates against or excludes items and services 
        available or paid for under this title or under another health 
        insurance policy, and
            ``(III) for policies sold or issued on or after the end of 
        the 90-day period beginning on the date of enactment of the 
        Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
        discloses such coordination or exclusion in the policy's outline 
        of coverage.

For purposes of this clause, the terms `coordinates' and `coordination' 
mean, with respect to a policy in relation to health benefits under this 
title or under another health insurance policy, that the policy under 
its terms is secondary to, or excludes from payment, items and services 
to the extent available or paid for under this title or under another 
health insurance policy.
    ``(vi)(I) An individual entitled to benefits under part A or 
enrolled under part B of this title who is applying for a health 
insurance policy (other than a policy described in subclause (III)) 
shall be furnished a disclosure statement described in clause (vii) for 
the type of policy being applied for. Such statement shall be furnished 
as a part of (or together with) the application for such policy.
    ``(II) Whoever issues or sells a health insurance policy (other than 
a policy described in subclause (III)) to an individual described in 
subclause (I) and fails to furnish the appropriate disclosure statement 
as required under such subclause shall be fined under title 18, United 
States Code, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in 
addition to or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil 
money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of a 
person other than the issuer of the policy) for each such violation.
    ``(III) A policy described in this subclause (to which subclauses 
(I) and (II) do not apply) is a Medicare supplemental policy or a health 
insurance policy identified under 60 Federal Register 30880 (June 12, 
1995) as a policy not required to have a disclosure statement.
    ``(IV) Any reference in this section to the revised NAIC model 
regulation (referred to in subsection (m)(1)(A)) is deemed a reference 
to such regulation as revised by section 171(m)(2) of the Social 
Security Act Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103-432) and as modified by 
substituting, for the disclosure required under section 16D(2), 
disclosure under subclause (I) of an appropriate disclosure statement 
under clause (vii).
    ``(vii) The disclosure statement described in this clause for a type 
of policy is the statement specified under subparagraph (D) of this 
paragraph (as in effect before the date of the enactment of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) for that type of 
policy, as revised as follows:
            ``(I) In each statement, amend the second line to read as 
        follows:

              `THIS IS NOT MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE'.

            ``(II) In each statement, strike the third line and insert 
        the following: `Some health care services paid for by Medicare 
        may also trigger the payment of benefits under this policy.'.
            ``(III) In each statement not described in subclause (V), 
        strike the boldface matter that begins `This insurance' and all 
        that follows up to the next paragraph that begins `Medicare'.
            ``(IV) In each statement not described in subclause (V), 
        insert before the boxed matter (that states `Before You Buy This 
        Insurance') the following: `This policy must pay benefits 
        without regard to other health benefit coverage to which you may 
        be entitled under Medicare or other insurance.'.
            ``(V) In a statement relating to policies providing both 
        nursing home and non-institutional coverage, to policies 
        providing nursing home benefits only, or policies providing home 
        care benefits only, amend the sentence that begins `Federal law' 
        to read as follows: `Federal law requires us to inform you that 
        in certain situations this insurance may pay for some care also 
        covered by Medicare.'.

    ``(viii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), nothing in this subparagraph 
shall restrict or preclude a State's ability to regulate health 
insurance policies, including any health insurance policy that is 
described in clause (iv), (v), or (vi)(III).
    ``(II) A State may not declare or specify, in statute, regulation, 
or otherwise, that a health insurance policy (other than a Medicare 
supplemental policy) or rider to an insurance contract which is not a 
health insurance policy, that is described in clause (iv), (v), or 
(vi)(III) and that is sold, issued, or renewed to an individual entitled 
to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B `duplicates' health 
benefits under this title or under a Medicare supplemental policy.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1882(d)(3) (42 U.S.C. 
1395ss(d)(3)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (C)--
                    (A) by striking ``with respect to (i)'' and 
                inserting ``with respect to'', and
                    (B) by striking ``, (ii) the sale'' and all that 
                follows up to the period at the end; and
            (2) by striking subparagraph (D).

    (c) Transitional <<NOTE: 42 USC 1395ss note.>>  Provision.--
            (1) No penalties.--Subject to paragraph (3), no criminal or 
        civil money penalty may be imposed under section 1882(d)(3)(A) 
        of the Social Security Act for any act or omission that occurred 
        during the transition period (as defined in paragraph (4)) and 
        that relates to any health insurance policy that is described in 
        clause (iv) or (v) of such section (as amended by subsection 
        (a)).
            (2) Limitation on legal action.--Subject to paragraph (3), 
        no legal action shall be brought or continued in any Federal or 
        State court insofar as such action--
                    (A) includes a cause of action which arose, or which 
                is based on or evidenced by any act or omission which 
                occurred, during the transition period; and
                    (B) relates to the application of section 
                1882(d)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act to any act or 
                omission with respect to the sale, issuance, or renewal 
                of any health insurance policy that is described in 
                clause (iv) or (v) of such section (as amended by 
                subsection (a)).
            (3) Disclosure condition.--In the case of a policy described 
        in clause (iv) of section 1882(d)(3)(A) of the Social Security 
        Act that is sold or issued on or after the effective date of 
        statements under section 171(d)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act 
        Amendments of 1994 and before the end of the 30-day period 
        beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, paragraphs 
        (1) and (2) shall only apply if disclosure was made in

        Act (as in effect before the date of the enactment of this Act).
            (4) Transition period.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``transition period'' means the period beginning on November 5, 
        1991, and ending on the date of the enactment of this Act.

    (d) Effective <<NOTE: 42 USC 1395ss note.>>  Date.--(1) Except as 
provided in this subsection, the amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
be effective as if included in the enactment of section 4354 of the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

Act, as added by subsection (a), shall only apply to individuals 
applying for--
            (i) a health insurance policy described in section 
        1882(d)(3)(A)(iv) of such Act (as added by subsection (a)),

for the disclosure statement described in clause (vii) of such section, 
the statement specified under section 1882(d)(3)(D) of the Social 
Security Act (as in effect before the date of the enactment of this 
Act), without the revision specified in such clause.

SEC. 301. MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

    (a) In General.--Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 (relating to 
additional itemized deductions for individuals) is amended by

219 the following new section:

``SEC. 220. MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

    ``(a) Deduction Allowed.--In the case of an individual who is an 
eligible individual for any month during the taxable year, there shall 
be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year an amount equal to the 
aggregate amount paid in cash during such taxable year by such 
individual to a medical savings account of such individual.
    ``(b) Limitations.--

        solely for a qualified long-term care insurance
contract (as defined in section 7702B(b) of such Code), no gain or loss 
shall be recognized on the exchange. If, in addition to a qualified 
long-term care insurance contract, money or other property is received 
in the exchange, then any gain shall be recognized to the extent of the 
sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property 
received. For purposes of this paragraph, the cancellation of a contract 
providing for long-term care insurance coverage and reinvestment of the 
cancellation proceeds in a qualified long-term care insurance contract 
within 60 days thereafter shall be treated as an exchange.

                conform any other long-term care rider to be so treated,
        shall not be treated as a modification or material change of 
        such contract.
            (5) Application of per diem limitation to existing 
        contracts.--The amount of per diem payments made under a 
        contract issued on or before July 31, 1996, with respect to an 
        insured which are excludable from gross income by reason of 
        section 7702B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by 
        this section) shall not be reduced under subsection (d)(2)(B) 
        thereof by reason of reimbursements received under a contract 
        issued on or before such date. The preceding sentence shall 
        cease to apply as of the date (after July 31, 1996) such 
        contract is exchanged or there is any contract modification 
        which results in an increase in the amount of such per diem 
        payments or the amount of such reimbursements.

        taxes under this subtitle or subtitle B, shall be taxable for 
        such taxable year in the manner provided in subsection (b) if 
        the tax imposed pursuant to such subsection exceeds the tax

        calendar year after 1996, such $100,000 and $500,000 amounts 
        shall be increased by an amount equal to such dollar amount 
        multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under 
        section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting `1994' 
        for `1992' in subparagraph (B) thereof. Any increase under the
