   TITLE II--TRANSPORTATION FUNDING <<NOTE: Urban and rural areas.>>  
FLEXIBILITY

SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--
            (1) Federal infrastructure spending on transportation is 
        critical to the efficient movement of goods and people in the 
        United States;
            (2) section 1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
        Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Stat. 1921) has been estimated to 
        result in fiscal year 1996 transportation spending being reduced 
        by as much as $2,700,000,000;
            (3) such section 1003(c) will result in a reduction of 
        critical funds to States from the Highway Trust Fund; and
            (4) the funding reduction will have adverse effects on the 
        national economy and the predictability of funding for the 
        Nation's highway system and impede interstate commerce.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to make the program categories in the Federal-aid 
        highway program more flexible so that States may fund high-
        priority projects in fiscal year 1996;
            (2) to reallocate funds from certain programs during fiscal 
        year 1996 so that the States will be able to continue their core 
        transportation infrastructure programs;
            (3) to ensure the equitable distribution of funds to 
        urbanized areas with a population over 200,000 in a manner 
        consistent with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency 
        Act of 1991; and
            (4) to suspend certain penalties that would be imposed on 
        the States.

SEC. 202. FUNDING RESTORATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than the 10th day following the date of 
the enactment of this Act and on October 1, 1997, or as soon as possible 
thereafter, the Secretary shall allocate among the States the amounts 
made available, as a result of section 203, to carry out this section 
for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, respectively, for projects eligible for 
assistance under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code.

        population of over 200,000 under section 133(d)(3) of title 23, 
        United States Code.
            (2) Percentage.--The percentage referred to in paragraph (1)

                    (A) the total amount of the reduction in funds that 
                would have been attributed under section 133(d)(3) of 
                title 23, United States Code, to urbanized areas of the 
                State with an urbanized population of over 200,000 for 
                fiscal year 1996 as a result of the application of 
                section 1003(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
                Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Stat. 1921); by

        supplies.--Regulations prescribed by the Secretary under 
        sections 31136 and 31502 of title 49, United States Code, 
        regarding maximum driving and on-duty time for drivers used by 
        motor carriers shall not apply to drivers transporting 
        agricultural commodities or farm supplies for agricultural 
        purposes in a State if such transportation is limited to an area 
        within a 100 air mile radius from the source of the commodities 
        or the distribution point for the farm supplies and is during 
        the planting and harvesting seasons within such State, as 
        determined by the State.
            (2) Transportation and operation of ground water well 
        drilling rigs.--Such regulations shall, in the case of a driver 
        of a commercial motor vehicle who is used primarily in the 
        transportation and operation of a ground water well drilling 
        rig, permit any period of 7 or 8 consecutive days to end with 
        the beginning of an off-duty period of 24 or more consecutive 
        hours for the purposes of determining maximum driving and on-
        duty time.
            (3) Transportation of construction materials and 
        equipment.--Such regulations shall, in the case of a driver of a 
        commercial motor vehicle who is used primarily in the 
        transportation of construction materials and equipment, permit 
        any period of 7 or 8 consecutive days to end with the beginning 
        of an off-duty period of 24 or more consecutive hours for the 
        purposes of determining maximum driving and on-duty time.
            (4) Drivers of utility service vehicles.--Such regulations 
        shall, in the case of a driver of a utility service vehicle, 
        permit any period of 7 or 8 consecutive days to end with the 
        beginning of an off-duty period of 24 or more consecutive hours 
        for the purposes of determining maximum driving and on-duty 
        time.
            (5) Snow and ice removal.--A State may waive the 
        requirements of chapter 313 of title 49, United States Code, 
        with respect to a vehicle that is being operated within the 
        boundaries of an eligible unit of local government by an 
        employee of such unit for the purpose of removing snow or ice 
        from a roadway by plowing, sanding, or salting. Such waiver 
        authority shall only apply in a case where the employee is 
        needed to operate the vehicle because the employee of the 
        eligible unit of local government who ordinarily operates the 
        vehicle and who has a commercial drivers license is unable to 
        operate the vehicle or is in need of additional assistance due 
        to a snow emergency.

    (b) Preemption.--Nothing contained in this section shall require the 
preemption of State laws and regulations concerning the safe operation 
of commercial motor vehicles as the result of exemptions from Federal 
requirements provided under this section.
    (c) Review by the Secretary.--The Secretary may conduct a rulemaking 
proceeding to determine whether granting any exemption provided by 
subsection (a) (other than paragraph (2)) is not in the public interest 
and would have a significant adverse impact on the safety of commercial 
motor vehicles. If, at any time as a result of such a proceeding, the 
Secretary determines that granting such exemption would not be in the 
public interest and would have a significant adverse impact on the 
safety of commercial motor vehicles, the Secretary may prevent the 
exemption from going into effect, modify the exemption, or revoke the 
exemption. The Secretary may develop a program to monitor the exemption, 
including agreements with carriers to permit the Secretary to examine 
insurance information maintained by an insurer on a carrier.
    (d) Report.--The Secretary shall monitor the commercial motor 
vehicle safety performance of drivers of vehicles that are subject to an 
exemption under this section. If the Secretary determines that public 
safety has been adversely affected by an exemption granted under this 
section, the Secretary shall report to Congress on the determination.

        maintenance vehicles, by a driver to or from an active 
        construction site (a construction site between initial 
        mobilization of equipment and materials to the site to the final 
        completion of the construction project) within a 50 air mile 
        radius of the normal work reporting location of the driver. This

                occasional travel or movement outside the service area 
                necessitated by any utility emergency as determined by 
                the utility provider); and

            (1) a substantial number of the citizens of the State rely 
        on home heating oil for heat during winter months;
            (2) current maximum on-duty time regulations may endanger 
        the welfare of these citizens by impeding timely deliveries of 
        home heating oil;
            (3) the State will ensure an equal to or greater level of 
        safety with respect to home heating oil deliveries than the 
        level of safety resulting from compliance with the regulations 
        referred to in subsection (a);
            (4) the State will monitor the safety of home heating oil 
        deliveries while participating in the program;
            (5) employers of deliverers of home heating oil that will be 
        covered by the program will agree to make all safety data 
        developed from the pilot program available to the State and to 
        the Secretary;
            (6) the State will only permit employers of deliverers of 
        home heating oil with satisfactory safety records to be covered 
        by the program; and
            (7) the State will comply with such other criteria as the 
        Secretary determines are necessary to implement the program 
        consistent with this section.

    (c) Participation in Program.--Upon approval of an application of a 
State under this section, the Secretary shall permit the State to 
participate in the pilot program for an initial period of 15 days during 
the winter heating season of the State (as determined by the Governor 
and the Secretary). If, after the last day of such 15-day period, the 
Secretary finds that a State's continued participation in the program is 
consistent with this section and has resulted in no significant adverse 
impact on public safety and is in the public interest, the Secretary 
shall extend the State's participation in the program for periods of up 
to 30 additional days during such heating season.
    (d) Suspension From Program.--The Secretary may suspend a State's 
participation in the pilot program at any time if the Secretary finds--
            (1) that the State has not complied with any of the criteria 
        for participation in the program under this section;
            (2) that a State's participation in the program has caused a 
        significant adverse impact on public safety and is not in the 
        public interest; or
            (3) the existence of an emergency.

    (e) <<NOTE: Rulemaking.>>  Review by Secretary.--Within 90 days 
after the completion of the pilot program, the Secretary shall initiate 
a rulemaking to determine, based in part on the results of the program, 
whether to--
            (1) permit a State to grant waivers of the regulations 
        referred to in subsection (a) to motor carriers transporting 
        home heating oil within the borders of the State, subject to 
        such conditions as the Secretary may impose, if the Secretary 
        determines that such waivers by the State meet the conditions in 
        section 31136(e) of title 49, United States Code; or
            (2) amend the regulations referred to in subsection (a) as 
        may be necessary to provide flexibility to motor carriers 
        delivering home heating oil during winter periods of peak 
        demand.

    (f) Definition.--In this section, the term ``7 or 8 consecutive 
days'' has the meaning such term has under section 345 of this Act.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as the 
``Administrator'') shall not require adoption or implementation by a 
State of a test-only I/M240 enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance 
program as a means of compliance with section 182 or 187 of the Clean 
Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a; 7512a), but the Administrator may approve such 
a program if a State chooses to adopt the program as a means of 
compliance with such section.
    (b) Limitation on Plan Disapproval.--The Administrator shall not 
disapprove or apply an automatic discount to a State implementation plan 
revision under section 182 or 187 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a; 
7512a) on the basis of a policy, regulation, or guidance providing for a 
discount of emissions credits because the inspection and maintenance 
program in such plan revision is decentralized or a test-and-repair 
program.
    (c) Emissions Reduction Credits.--
            (1) State plan revision; approval.--Within 120 days of the 
        date of the enactment of this subsection, a State may submit an 
        implementation plan revision proposing an interim inspection and 
        maintenance program under section 182 or 187 of the Clean Air 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a; 7512a). The Administrator shall approve 
        the program based on the full amount of credits proposed by the 
        State for each element of the program if the proposed credits 
        reflect good faith estimates by the State and the revision is 
        otherwise in compliance with such Act. If, within such 120-day 
        period, the State submits to the Administrator proposed 
        revisions to the implementation plan, has all of the statutory 
        authority necessary to implement the revisions, and has proposed 
        a regulation to make the revisions, the Administrator may 
        approve the revisions without regard to whether or not such 
        regulation has been issued as a final regulation by the State.
            (2) Expiration of interim approval.--The interim approval 
        shall expire on the earlier of (A) the last day of the 18-month 
        period beginning on the date of the interim approval, or (B) the 
        date of final approval. The interim approval may not be 
        extended.
            (3) Final approval.--The Administrator shall grant final 
        approval of the revision based on the credits proposed by the 
        State during or after the period of interim approval if data 
        collected on the operation of the State program demonstrates 
        that the credits are appropriate and the revision is otherwise 
        in compliance with the Clean Air Act.
            (4) Basis of approval; no automatic discount.--Any 
        determination with respect to interim or full approval shall be 
        based on the elements of the program and shall not apply any 
        automatic discount because the program is decentralized or a 
        test-and-repair program.

            (5) ensure that any loan from the bank will bear interest at 
        or below market interest rates, as determined by the State, to

    TITLE IV--WOODROW WILSON <<NOTE: Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge 
 Authority Act of 1995. Maryland. Virginia. Washington, DC.>>  MEMORIAL 
BRIDGE

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge 
Authority Act of 1995''.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) traffic congestion imposes serious economic burdens on 
        the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area, costing each commuter 
        an estimated $1,000 per year;
            (2) the volume of traffic in the metropolitan Washington, 
        D.C., area is expected to increase by more than 70 percent 
        between 1990 and 2020;
            (3) the deterioration of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge 
        and the growing population of the metropolitan Washington, D.C., 
        area contribute significantly to traffic congestion;
            (4) the Bridge serves as a vital link in the Interstate 
        System and in the Northeast corridor;
            (5) identifying alternative methods for maintaining this 
        vital link of the Interstate System is critical to addressing 
        the traffic congestion of the area;
            (6) the Bridge is--
                    (A) the only drawbridge in the metropolitan 
                Washington, D.C., area on the Interstate System;
                    (B) the only segment of the Capital Beltway with 
                only 6 lanes; and
                    (C) the only segment of the Capital Beltway with a 
                remaining expected life of less than 10 years;
            (7) the Bridge is the only part of the Interstate System 
        owned by the Federal Government;
            (8)(A) the Bridge was constructed by the Federal Government;
            (B) prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Federal Government has contributed 100 percent of the cost of 
        building and rehabilitating the Bridge; and
            (C) the Federal Government has a continuing responsibility 
        to fund future costs associated with the upgrading of the 
        Interstate Route 95 crossing, including the rehabilitation and 
        reconstruction of the Bridge;
            (9) the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Coordination 
        Committee is undertaking planning studies pertaining to the 
        Bridge, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and other applicable Federal laws;
            (10) the transfer of ownership of the Bridge to a regional 
        entity under the terms and conditions described in this title 
        would foster regional transportation planning efforts to 
        identify solutions to the growing problem of traffic congestion 
        on and around the Bridge;
            (11) any material change to the Bridge must take into 
        account the interests of nearby communities, the commuting 
        public, Federal, State, and local government organizations, and 
        other affected groups; and
            (12) a commission of congressional, State, and local 
        officials and transportation representatives has recommended to 
        the Secretary that the Bridge be transferred to an independent 
        authority to be established by the Capital Region jurisdictions.

SEC. 403. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are--
