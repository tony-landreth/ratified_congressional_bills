            (1) The Historically Black Graduate Professional Schools 
        identified under section 326 of the Higher Education Act may 
        receive grant funds if the Secretary of Education determines 
        that such institutions make a substantial contribution to the 
        legal, medical, dental, veterinary, or other graduate 
        opportunity for African Americans.
            (2) The health professions schools which participate under

        dentists, 50 percent of the Nation's African American 
        pharmacists, and 75 percent of the Nation's African American 
        veterinarians.
            (3) A majority of the graduates of these schools practice in 
        poor urban and rural areas of the country providing care to many 
        disadvantaged Americans.
            (4) The survival of these schools will contribute to the 
        improved health status of disadvantaged persons, and of all 
        Americans.
