Public Law 104-70
104th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To amend the Clean Air Act to provide for an optional provision for the 
  reduction of work-related vehicle trips and miles travelled in ozone 
        nonattainment areas designated as severe, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 23, 1995 -  [H.R. 325]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. OPTIONAL EMPLOYER MANDATED TRIP REDUCTION.

    Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act <<NOTE: 42 USC 7511a.>> is 
amended to read as follows:
            ``(B) The State may also, in its discretion, submit a 
        revision at any time requiring employers in such area to 
        implement programs to reduce work-related vehicle trips and 
        miles travelled by employees. <<NOTE: Guidelines.>> Such 
        revision shall be developed in accordance with guidance issued 
        by the Administrator pursuant to section 108(f) and may require 
        that employers in such area increase average passenger occupancy 
        per vehicle in commuting trips between home and the workplace 
        during peak travel periods. The guidance of the Administrator 
        may specify average vehicle occupancy rates which vary for 
        locations within a nonattainment area (suburban, center city, 
        business district) or among nonattainment areas reflecting 
        existing occupancy rates and the availability of high occupancy 
        modes. Any State required to submit a revision under this 
        subparagraph (as in effect before the date of enactment of this 
        sentence) containing provisions requiring employers to reduce 
        work-related vehicle trips and miles travelled by employees may, 
        in accordance with State law, remove such provisions from the 
        implementation plan, or withdraw its submission, if the State 
        notifies the Administrator, in writing, that the State has 
        undertaken, or will undertake, one or more alternative methods 
        that will achieve emission reductions equivalent to those to be 
        achieved by the removed or withdrawn provisions.''.

    Approved December 23, 1995.
