Public Law 104-218
104th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
  To confer honorary citizenship of the United States on Agnes Gonxha 
  Bojaxhiu, also known as Mother Teresa. <<NOTE: Oct. 1, 1996 -  [H.J. 
                              Res. 191]>> 

Whereas the United States has conferred honorary citizenship on only 
    three occasions in its more than two hundred years, and honorary 
    citizenship is and should remain an extraordinary honor not lightly 
    conferred nor frequently granted;
Whereas Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, better known throughout the world as 
    Mother Teresa, has worked tirelessly with orphaned and abandoned 
    children, the poor, the sick, and the dying;
Whereas Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, and 
    has taken in those who have been rejected as ``unacceptable'' and 
    cared for them when no one else would, regardless of race, color, 
    creed, or condition;
Whereas Mother Teresa has deservedly received numerous honors, including 
    the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize and the 1985 Presidential Medal of 
    Freedom;
Whereas Mother Teresa has worked in areas all over the world, including 
    the United States, to provide comfort to the world's neediest; and
Whereas Mother Teresa through her Missionaries of Charity has 
    established within the United States numerous soup kitchens, 
    emergency shelters for women, shelters for unwed mothers, shelters 
    for men, after-school and summer camp programs for children, homes 
    for the dying, prison ministry, nursing homes, and hospital and 
    shut-in ministry: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, 
also known as Mother Teresa, is proclaimed to be an honorary citizen of 
the United States of America.

    Approved October 1, 1996.
