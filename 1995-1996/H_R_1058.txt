                                representations of the covered person is

            TITLE III--AUDITOR DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATE FRAUD

SEC. 301. FRAUD DETECTION AND DISCLOSURE.

    (a) In General.--The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a 
et seq.) is amended by inserting immediately after section 10 the 
following new section:

``SEC. 10A. <<NOTE: 15 USC 78j-1.>> AUDIT REQUIREMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--Each audit required pursuant to this title of the 
financial statements of an issuer by an independent public accountant 
shall include, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, 
as may be modified or supplemented from time to time by the Commission--
            ``(1) procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of 
        detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material 
        effect on the determination of financial statement amounts;
            ``(2) procedures designed to identify related party 
        transactions that are material to the financial statements or 
        otherwise require disclosure therein; and
            ``(3) an evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt 
        about the ability of the issuer to continue as a going concern 
        during the ensuing fiscal year.

[[Page 109 STAT. 763]]

    ``(b) Required Response To Audit Discoveries.--
            ``(1) Investigation and report to management.--If, in the 
        course of conducting an audit pursuant to this title to which 
        subsection (a) applies, the independent public accountant 
        detects or otherwise becomes aware of information indicating 
        that an illegal act (whether or not perceived to have a material 
        effect on the financial statements of the issuer) has or may 
        have occurred, the accountant shall, in accordance with 
        generally accepted auditing standards, as may be modified or 
        supplemented from time to time by the Commission--
                    ``(A)(i) determine whether it is likely that an 
                illegal act has occurred; and
                    ``(ii) if so, determine and consider the possible 
                effect of the illegal act on the financial statements of 
                the issuer, including any contingent monetary effects, 
                such as fines, penalties, and damages; and
                    ``(B) as soon as practicable, inform the appropriate 
                level of the management of the issuer and assure that 
                the audit committee of the issuer, or the board of 
                directors of the issuer in the absence of such a 
                committee, is adequately informed with respect to 
                illegal acts that have been detected or have otherwise 
                come to the attention of such accountant in the course 
                of the audit, unless the illegal act is clearly 
                inconsequential.
            ``(2) Response to failure to take remedial action.--If, 
        after determining that the audit committee of the board of 
        directors of the issuer, or the board of directors of the issuer 
        in the absence of an audit committee, is adequately informed 
        with respect to illegal acts that have been detected or have 
        otherwise come to the attention of the accountant in the course 
        of the audit of such accountant, the independent public 
        accountant concludes that--
                    ``(A) the illegal act has a material effect on the 
                financial statements of the issuer;
                    ``(B) the senior management has not taken, and the 
                board of directors has not caused senior management to 
                take, timely and appropriate remedial actions with 
                respect to the illegal act; and
                    ``(C) the failure to take remedial action is 
                reasonably expected to warrant departure from a standard 
                report of the auditor, when made, or warrant resignation 
                from the audit engagement;
        the independent public accountant shall, as soon as practicable, 
        directly report its conclusions to the board of directors.
            ``(3) Notice to commission; response to failure to notify.--
        An issuer whose board of directors receives a report under 
        paragraph (2) shall inform the Commission by notice not later 
        than 1 business day after the receipt of such report and shall 
        furnish the independent public accountant making such report 
        with a copy of the notice furnished to the Commission. If the 
        independent public accountant fails to receive a copy of the 
        notice before the expiration of the required 1-business-day 
        period, the independent public accountant shall--
                    ``(A) resign from the engagement; or
                    ``(B) furnish to the Commission a copy of its report 
                (or the documentation of any oral report given) not 
                later than 1 business day following such failure to 
                receive notice.

[[Page 109 STAT. 764]]

            ``(4) Report after resignation.--If an independent public 
        accountant resigns from an engagement under paragraph (3)(A), 
        the accountant shall, not later than 1 business day following 
        the failure by the issuer to notify the Commission under 
        paragraph (3), furnish to the Commission a copy of the 
        accountant's report (or the documentation of any oral report 
        given).

    ``(c) Auditor Liability Limitation.--No independent public 
accountant shall be liable in a private action for any finding, 
conclusion, or statement expressed in a report made pursuant to 
paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b), including any rule promulgated 
pursuant thereto.
    ``(d) Civil Penalties in Cease-and-Desist Proceedings.--If the 
Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing in a 
proceeding instituted pursuant to section 21C, that an independent 
public accountant has willfully violated paragraph (3) or (4) of 
subsection (b), the Commission may, in addition to entering an order 
under section 21C, impose a civil penalty against the independent public 
accountant and any other person that the Commission finds was a cause of 
such violation. The determination to impose a civil penalty and the 
amount of the penalty shall be governed by the standards set forth in 
section 21B.
    ``(e) Preservation of Existing Authority.--Except as provided in 
subsection (d), nothing in this section shall be held to limit or 
otherwise affect the authority of the Commission under this title.
    ``(f) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `illegal act' 
means an act or omission that violates any law, or any rule or 
regulation having the force of law.''.
    (b) <<NOTE: 15 USC 78j-1 note.>> Effective Dates.--The amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply to each annual report--
            (1) for any period beginning on or after January 1, 1996, 
        with respect to any registrant that is required to file selected 
        quarterly financial data pursuant to the rules or regulations of 
        the Securities and Exchange Commission; and
            (2) for any period beginning on or after January 1, 1997, 
        with respect to any other registrant.
