Joint Resolution
To designate August 13 through August 19, 1990, as `Home Health Aide Week'.
Whereas a home health aide is a person who is a member of a multi-disciplinary
team which provides health care for patients in a home environment;
Whereas the personal care and health-related services provided by a home health
aide are a vital part of the services provided by home care companies and
hospices and help to maintain a patient's physical and emotional well-being;
Whereas a home health aide is responsible for assisting members of a
health-care team in following a pragmatic, goal-oriented plan of patient care;
Whereas the duties performed by a home health aide include assisting
patients in their daily living activities, providing them with a clean
and safe environment, providing them with personal care rehabilitative and
supportive services, and observing and reporting to other members of the
health-care team significant changes in the status of the patient; and
Whereas by providing such important health-care services, a home health aide
has a significant beneficial impact on the lives of the patients served by
the aide: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of August 13 through August
 19, 1990, is designated as `Home Health Aide Week', and the President is
