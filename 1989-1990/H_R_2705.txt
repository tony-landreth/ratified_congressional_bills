An Act
Relating to the method by which Government contributions to the Federal
employees health benefits program shall be computed for 1990 or 1991 if no

 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled, That (a)(1) in the administration of
 chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, for contract year 1990 or 1991,
 in order to compute the average subscription charges under section 8906(a)
 of such title for such contract years, the subscription charges in effect
 for the indemnity benefit plan on the beginning date of each such contract
 year shall be deemed to be the subscription charges which--
 (A) were in effect for such plan on the beginning date of the preceding
 contract year as adjusted under paragraph (2); or
 (B) if subparagraph (A) does not apply, were deemed under this Act to have
 been in effect for such plan with respect to the preceding contract year
 as adjusted under paragraph (2).
 (2) The subscription charges under paragraph (1) shall be increased or
 decreased (as appropriate) by the average percentage by which the respective
 subscription charges taken into account under paragraphs (1), (3), and (4)
 of such section 8906(a) for that contract year increased or decreased from
 the subscription charges taken into account under such paragraphs (1),
 (3), and (4) for the preceding contract year.
 (b) Separate percentages shall be computed under subsection (a)(2) with
 respect to enrollments for self alone and enrollments for self and family,
 respectively.
 (c) The provisions of this Act shall not apply to contract year 1991, if

 5, United States Code, and such amendment is required to be implemented by
 the commencement of negotiations pertaining to rates and benefits for such
 contract year.
 (d) Any reference in this Act to a `contract year' shall be considered to be a
 reference to a contract year under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.
