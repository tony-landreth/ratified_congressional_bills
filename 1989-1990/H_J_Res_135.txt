H.J.Res.135
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning May 7, 1989, as `National Correctional Officers
Week'.
Whereas American correctional officers who work in our jails and prisons are
currently responsible for the containment and control of over six hundred
thousand prisoners;
Whereas correctional officers must protect inmates from violence while
encouraging them to develop skills and attitudes that can help them become
productive members of society following their release;
Whereas the morale of correctional officers is affected by many factors,
and the public perception of the role of correctional officers is more often
based upon dramatization rather than factual review;
Whereas good job performance requires correctional officers to absorb the
adverse attitudes present in confinement while maintaining themselves as
professionals in order to have their actions appreciated and accepted by
the public at large;
Whereas correctional officers had been similarly honored by many States
and localities;
Whereas correctional officers had been similarly honored by a joint resolution
of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress
assembled in 1984, 1985, and 1987; and
Whereas the attitude and morale of correctional officers is a matter worthy
of serious congressional attention: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing May 7, 1989,
 hereby is designated `National Correctional Officers Week' and the President
 of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe such week with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
