One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating October 1990 as `National Breast Cancer Awareness Month'.
Whereas breast cancer will strike an estimated 150,000 women and 900 men in
the United States in 1990;
Whereas one out of every ten women will develop breast cancer at some point
in her life;
Whereas the risk of developing breast cancer increases as a woman grows older;
Whereas breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women,
killing an estimated 43,000 women and 300 men in 1989;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has risen from
78 percent in the 1940s to over 90 percent today;
Whereas most breast cancers are detected by the woman herself;
Whereas educating both the public and physicians about the importance of
early detection will result in reducing breast cancer mortality;
Whereas appropriate use of screening mammography, in conjunction with clinical
examination and breast self-examination, can result in the detection of many
breast cancers early in their development and increase the survival rate to
nearly 100 percent;
Whereas data from controlled trials clearly demonstrate that deaths from
breast cancer are significantly reduced in women over the age of 40 by using
mammography as a screening tool;
Whereas women do not have mammograms for a variety of reasons, such as the
cost of testing, lack of information, and fear;
Whereas access to screening mammography is directly related to socioeconomic
status;
Whereas increased awareness about the importance of screening mammography
will result in the procedure being regularly requested by the patient and
recommended by the health care provider; and
Whereas it is projected that more women will use this lifesaving test as it
becomes increasingly available and affordable: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 1990 is designated as
 `National Breast Cancer Awareness Month', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
