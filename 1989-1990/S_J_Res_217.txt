One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing February 4, 1990, and ending February 10,
1990, and the period commencing February 3, 1991, and ending February 9,
1991, as `National Burn Awareness Week'.
Whereas the burn problem in the United States is one of the worst of any
industrialized nation in the world;
Whereas burn injuries are one of the leading causes of accidental death in
the United States today;
Whereas every year over 2,000,000 people are victims of some form of burn
injury in the United States alone, and children account for between one-third
and one-half of this total;
Whereas of these injuries, over 70,000 are hospitalized and account for
9,000,000 disability days and $100,000,000 in costs annually;
Whereas over 6,000 people die from burn injuries annually, and the
rehabilitative and psychological impact of burns is devastating;
Whereas young children are in the highest risk group suffering from hot
liquid burns and injuries caused by child fire play and fire setting;
Whereas older adults and the disabled are also at great risk and extremely
susceptible to burn injuries;
Whereas burn survivors often face years of costly reconstructive surgery and
extensive physical and psychological rehabilitation in overcoming disabilities
and fears of rejection by family members, friends, coworkers, schoolmates,
and the public in general;
Whereas it is estimated that approximately 75 percent of all burn injuries
and deaths could be prevented by a comprehensive national educational and
awareness campaign and by changes in the design and technology of homes and
consumer products;
Whereas a general public awareness of the need for smoke detectors and
home fire escape plans, in combination with an understanding of the risk
associated with items in the home environment, can cause a reduction of
injuries and loss of life; and
Whereas there is a need for an effective national program that deals with all
aspects of burn injuries and on the prevention thereof: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing February 4,
 1990, and ending February 10, 1990, and the period commencing February
 3, 1991, and ending February 9, 1991, are designated as `National Burn
 Awareness Week', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States and all Federal,
 State, and local government officials to observe that week with appropriate
 programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
