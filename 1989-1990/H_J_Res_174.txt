H.J.Res.174
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the decade beginning January 1, 1990, as the `Decade of the
Brain'.
Whereas it is estimated that fifty million Americans are affected each year by
disorders and disabilities that involve the brain, including the major mental
illnesses; inherited and degenerative diseases; stroke; epilepsy; addictive
disorders; injury resulting from prenatal events, environmental neurotoxins
and trauma; and speech, language, hearing and other cognitive disorders;
Whereas it is estimated that treatment, rehabilitation and related costs of
disorders and disabilities that affect the brain represents a total economic
burden of $305,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas the people of the Nation should be aware of the exciting research
advances on the brain and of the availability of effective treatment of
disorders and disabilities that affect the brain;
Whereas a technological revolution occurring in the brain sciences,
resulting in such procedures as positron emission tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging, permits clinical researchers to observe the living
brain noninvasively and in exquisite detail, to define brain systems that
are implicated in specific disorders and disabilities, to study complex
neuropeptides and behavior as well as to begin to learn about the complex
structures underlying memory;
Whereas scientific information on the brain is amassing at an enormous rate,
and the field of computer and information sciences has reached a level of
sophistication sufficient to handle neuroscience data in a manner that would
be maximally useful to both basic researchers and clinicians dealing with
brain function and dysfunction;
Whereas advances in mathematics, physics, computational science, and brain
imaging technologies have made possible the initiation of significant work in
imaging brain function and pathology, modeling neural networks and simulating
their dynamic interactions;
Whereas comprehending the reality of the nervous system is still on the
frontier of technological innovation requiring a comprehensive effort to
decipher how individual neurons, by their collective action, give rise to
human intelligence;
Whereas fundamental discoveries at the molecular and cellular levels of the
organization of the brain are clarifying the role of the brain in translating
neurophysiologic events into behavior, thought, and emotion;
Whereas molecular biology and molecular genetics have yielded strategies
effective in preventing several forms of severe mental retardation and
are contributing to promising breakthroughs in the study of inheritable
neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease, and mental disorders,
such as affective illnesses;
Whereas the capacity to map the biochemical circuitry of neurotransmitters
and neuromodulators will permit the rational design of potent medications
possessing minimal adverse effects that will act on the discrete neurochemical
deficits associated with such disorders as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia
and Alzheimer's disease;
Whereas the incidence of neurologic, psychiatric, psychological, and cognitive
disorders and disabilities experienced by older persons will increase in
the future as the number of older persons increases;
Whereas studies of the brain and central nervous system will contribute
not only to the relief of neurologic, psychiatric, psychological, and
cognitive disorders, but also to the management of fertility and infertility,
cardiovascular disease, infectious and parasitic diseases, developmental
disabilities and immunologic disorders, as well as to an understanding of
behavioral factors that underlie the leading preventable causes of death in
this Nation;
Whereas the central nervous and immune systems are both signalling systems
which serve the entire organism, and there are direct connections between the
nervous and immune systems, and whereas studies of the modulatory effects
of each system on the other will enhance our understanding of diseases
as diverse as the major psychiatric disorders, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, and autoimmune disorders;
Whereas recent discoveries have led to fundamental insights as to why people
abuse drugs, how abused drugs affect brain function leading to addiction,
and how some of these drugs cause permanent brain damage;
Whereas studies of the brain will contribute to the development of new
treatments that will curtail the craving for drugs, break the addictive effects
of drugs, prevent the brain-mediated `high' caused by certain abused drugs,
and lessen the damage done to the developing minds of babies, who are the
innocent victims of drug abuse;
Whereas treatment for persons with head injury, developmental disabilities,
speech, hearing, and other cognitive functions is increasing in availability
and effectiveness;
Whereas the study of the brain involves the multidisciplinary efforts of
scientists from such diverse areas as physiology, biochemistry, psychology,
psychiatry, molecular biology, anatomy, medicine, genetics, and many others
working together toward the common goals of better understanding the structure
of the brain and how it affects our development, health, and behavior;
Whereas the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology has been awarded to
fifteen neuroscientists within the past twenty-five years, an achievement
that underscores the excitement and productivity of the study of the brain
and central nervous system and its potential for contributing to the health
of humanity;
Whereas the people of the Nation should be concerned with research into
disorders and disabilities that affect the brain, and should recognize
prevention and treatment of such disorders and disabilities as a health
priority; and
Whereas the declaration of the Decade of the Brain will focus needed government
attention on research, treatment, and rehabilitation in this area: Now,
therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That the decade beginning January 1,
  1990, hereby is designated the `Decade of the Brain', and the President
  of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
  calling upon all public officials and the people of the United States to
  observe such decade with appropriate programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
