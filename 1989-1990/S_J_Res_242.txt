Joint Resolution
Designating the week of April 22 through April 28, 1990, as `National Crime
Victims'
Rights Week'.
Whereas thirty-five million individuals in the United States are victimized
by crime each year, with six million falling prey to violence;
Whereas the Department of Justice estimates that five out of six individuals
will be the victim or intended victim of crime during their lifetimes;
Whereas many victims suffer severe psychological, physical, and emotional
hardships as a result of victimizations;
Whereas the Nation must commit its collective energies to improving the
criminal justice and social services response to victims;
Whereas injustice to crime victims must be redressed by implementing the
recommendations proposed by the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime; and
Whereas, as a Nation committed to justice and liberty for all, efforts must
be continued to remove the inequities victims face and to protect and restore
individual rights: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 22 through April 28, 1990,
 is designated as `National Crime Victims' Rights Week', and the President
 is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and
 activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
