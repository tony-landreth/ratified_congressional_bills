 in end-use energy efficiency and conservation and renewable energy;
 (2) develop methodologies which allow borrowing countries to include
 investments in end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy as explicit
 alternatives in the `least cost' energy sector investments plans they
 prepare with MDB assistance. Such plans shall give priority to projects
 and programs which support energy conservation, end-use efficiency and
 renewable energy sources in major economic sectors, and shall compare the
 economic and environmental costs of those actions with the economic and
 environmental costs of investments in conventional energy supplies;
 (3) provide analysis for each proposed loan to support additional power
 generating capacity, comparing the economic and environmental costs of
 investments in demand reduction, including energy conservation and end-use
 energy efficiency, with the economic and environmental costs of the proposal;

 projects with significant potential environmental impacts, or power projects,
 and if possible for all projects which involve expansion of generating
 capacity of more than 10 MW, develop a standard increase in project cost
 as a surrogate for the environmental costs;
 (6) encourage and promote end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy
 in negotiations of policy-based energy sector lending, and MDBs should
 consider not proceeding with policy-based sector loans which do not contain
 commitments from the borrowing country to devote a significant portion of
 its sector investments toward energy efficiency and renewable energy;
 (7) provide technical assistance as a component of all energy sector lending
 to help borrowing countries identify and pursue end-use energy efficiency
 investments. This technical assistance shall include support for detailed
 audits of energy use and the development of institutional capacity to
 promote end-use energy efficiency and conservation;
 (8) work with borrowing countries, with input from the public in both
 borrowing and donor countries, to develop loans for end-use energy efficiency
 and renewable energy, where possible `bundling' small projects into larger,
 more easily financed projects; and
 (9) seek the convening of a special seminar for board members and senior
 staff of each MDB concerning alternate energy investment opportunities and
 end-use energy efficiency and conservation.
 (b) The Secretary of the Treasury as a part of the annual report to the

 previous year for projects or programs of end-use energy efficiency and
 conservation and renewable energy.

 each MDB to prepare an analysis of the impact its current forestry sector
 loans will have on borrowing country emissions of CO2 and the status of
 proposals for specific forestry sector activities to reduce CO2 emissions.
 (d)(1) The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall
 issue guidance to all Agency missions and bureaus detailing the elements of a
 `Global Warming Initiative' which will emphasize the need to reduce emissions
 of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, through strategies consistent with their
 continued economic development. This initiative shall emphasize the need to
 accelerate sustainable development strategies in areas such as reforestation,
 biodiversity, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and
 renewable energy, and shall encourage mission directors to incorporate the
 elements of this initiative in developing their country programs.
 (2) The Agency for International Development shall--
 (A) increase the number and expertise of personnel devoted to end-use energy
 efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental activities in all bureaus
 and missions;

 activities to the preservation and restoration (as opposed to management
 for extraction) of natural forests.

 activities, of which $2,000,000 shall be made available for the Parks in
 Peril project, pursuant to the authority of section 119(b) and $1,000,000
 shall be available for the National Science Foundation's international

 section 119(b) may be expended in fiscal year 1990 pursuant to the authority
 of such section as amended by subparagraph (A).
 (e) The Secretary of the Treasury shall--
 (1) instruct the United States Executive Directors to the International
 Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development
 Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the African Development
 Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund,
 to actively support lending portfolios which allow debtor developing
 countries to reduce or restructure debt in concert with the sustainable
 use of their natural resources. As a part of any such debt restructuring
 program, the United States Executive Director should require a thorough
 review of opportunities this initiative may offer for providing additional
 financial resources for the management of natural resources. The Secretary
 shall submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the progress
 of this program by April 30, 1990;

 Act of 1961, the President shall take into account the extent to which
 the Government of each country is sufficiently responsive to United States
 Government concerns on coca control and whether the provision of assistance
 for that country is in the national interest of the United States.
 (d)(1) If any funds made available for any fiscal year for security assistance
 are not used for assistance for the country for which those funds were
 allocated because of any provision of law requiring the withholding of

 drug eradication targets or have otherwise taken significant steps to halt
 illicit drug production or trafficking, as follows:

CENTRAL AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION COMMISSION

 America, the President shall provide appropriate support and assistance in
 the development of a coordination mechanism agreed to by the governments of
 Central America, which shall be designated as the Central American Development

 with other nations providing assistance, with the United Nations, and with
 other concerned international and regional organizations--
 (1) encourage and participate in the creation of a multi-donor, multi-sectoral
 coordinating mechanism known as the CADCC; and
 (2) provide not less than $500,000 or more than $1,000,000 of funds

 of 1961 (relating to the Economic Support Fund) to be used to assist in the
 implementation of such Commission, and United States participation therein.

eligibility of poland and hungary for overseas private investment corporation
 SEC. 597. (a) PROGRAMS- Section 239(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of
 1961 is amended by inserting `Poland, Hungary,' after `Yugoslavia,'.
 (b) PARTICIPATION BY NONGOVERNMENTAL SECTOR- (1) In accordance with its
 mandate to foster private initiative and competition and enhance the ability
 of private enterprise to make its full contribution to the development
 process, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation shall support projects
 in Poland and Hungary which will result in enhancement of the nongovernmental

 (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term `nongovernmental sector'
 in Poland and Hungary includes private enterprises, cooperatives (insofar
 as they are not administered by the Governments of Poland or Hungary),
 joint ventures (including partners which are not the Governments of Poland

INTERNATIONAL COFFEE AGREEMENT
 SEC. 598. It is the Sense of the Congress that the International Coffee
 Agreement is an important measure in promoting economic and political
 stability in many developing countries, including Colombia, that the collapse
 of the Agreement would seriously undermine Colombia's efforts at fighting
 illegal drugs, and that the Administration should undertake every possible
 effort to successfully conclude a renewal of the Agreement.
LATVIA, ESTONIA, AND LITHUANIA
 SEC. 599. (a) The Congress finds that--
 (1) the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania gained their
 independence from the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic in 1918,
 a fact recognized by the government of the Russian Socialist Federative
 Soviet Republic in 1920;
 (2) the governments of the Latvian Democratic Republic and the Russian
 Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR) signed a Treaty of Peace in
 Riga, Latvia on August 11, 1920, in which the RSFSR `establishes the right
 of self-determination for all nations, even to the point of total separation
 from the States with which they have been incorporated' and declares that
 `Russia unreservedly recognizes the independence, self-subsistency and
 sovereignty of the Latvian State and voluntarily and forever renounces
 all sovereign rights over the Latvian people and territory which formerly
 belonged to Russia';
 (3) similar treaties were signed by both the Republic of Estonia and the
 Republic of Lithuania with the RSFSR on February 2, 1920 and July 12,
 1920, respectively';
 (4) the independent republics of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania swiftly
 recovered from the ravages of World War I and became active in the World
 community, gaining membership in the League of Nations on September 22,
 1921 and full recognition by the United States on July 28, 1922;
 (5) the sovereign rights of the independent states of Latvia, Estonia,
 and Lithuania were violated by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in a
 Secret Protocol to the Nazi-Soviet Treaty of Nonaggression of August 23, 1939,
 which divided Eastern Europe into Nazi and Soviet `spheres of influence';
 (6) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics coerced the governments of Latvia,
 Estonia, and Lithuania to sign Pacts of Mutual Assistance in October 1939,
 which stipulated that the `contracting parties undertake not to enter into
 any alliances or to participate in any coalitions directed against one of
 the contracting parties' and that `the carrying into effect of the present
 pact must in no way affect the sovereign rights of the contracting parties,
 in particular their political structure, their economic and social system,
 and their military measures';
 (7) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics violated not only those
 bilateral agreements with the independent Baltic states but also international
 conventions on the changing of international borders by force when the Soviet
 Union issued ultimatums to the three independent nations on June 15-16,
 1940, demanding the formation of governments to their liking, followed by
 armed invasions of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on June 16-17, 1940;
 (8) the occupation of the Baltic states was confirmed on July 14-15, 1940,
 with the irregular and illegal `election' of new parliaments, which then
 petitioned for admission into the Soviet Union, and these petitions were
 accepted by the Soviet Union, as follows: Lithuania's on August 3, 1940,
 Latvia's on August 4, 1940, and Estonia's on August 5, 1940;
 (9) the Government of the United States continues its policy of standing by
 the 1922 recognition of the de jure independent governments in the Baltic
 states, and of refusing to recognize the forced incorporation of the Baltic
 states into the Soviet Union;
 (10) the peoples of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania have never accepted the
 occupation of their native lands, and have demonstrated their resolve on
 numerous occasions since 1940, most notably in the last three years. The
 most striking demonstration of the desires of the Baltic people took place
 on August 23, 1989, the fiftieth anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet Treaty
 of Nonaggression, when nearly two million citizens of Latvia, Estonia,
 and Lithuania joined hands in a four-hundred-mile human chain stretching
 across the Baltic states from the Estonian capital of Tallinn, through the
 Latvian capital, Riga, to the Lithuanian capital of Vilninus;
 (11) the people of the Baltic states, through their elected representatives
 in the Popular Front of Latvia, the Popular Front of Estonia, and the
 Lithuanian Movement in Support of Perestroika `Sajudis', have declared
 their desire for the restoration of independence in the Baltic states; and
 (12) even the Communist officials and regimes in each of the Baltic states
 have begun to respond to the drive for more autonomy.
 (b) The Congress urges the President--
 (1) to raise the issue of the political rights of the Baltic peoples in
 all diplomatic contacts with the Soviet Union including during the meeting
 between President Bush and President Gorbachev in December, 1989 and during
 the Presidential summit scheduled in 1990 between the United States and
 the Soviet Union; and
 (2) to call upon the Soviet Union--
 (A) to honor the international agreements it has voluntarily entered into,
 such as the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the
 bilateral agreements it has voluntarily entered into with the independent
 governments of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania,
 (B) to allow the people of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania their right of
 self-determination, as guaranteed by the RSFSR in 1920 as well as by the
 current constitution of the Soviet Union,
 (C) to recognize the human rights of all peoples both within the Soviet
 Union and under Soviet influence, and
 (D) to replace the policy of aggressive industrialization in the Baltic
 states, which has poisoned the land, air, and water of Latvia, Estonia,
 and Lithuania, with one of environmental responsibility.

AND HUNGARY
 SEC. 599A. Notwithstanding section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22

 Control Act,
 (2) is from Poland, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia,
 (3) was imported or temporarily imported into the United States before June

and shall be permitted to remain in the United States, and the museum or
educational institution shall not be subject to any penalty by reason of
such importation.
HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA
 SEC. 599B. (1) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (A) the United Nations in 1989 issued its first report on humans rights in
 Cuba this year, the result of a year-long investigation that concluded on
 the 30th year of Fidel Castro's rise to power;
 (B) the report extensively documented across-the-board human rights abuses
 that include cases of torture, missing people, religious persecution,
 violations of civil and political rights and violations of economic and
 social rights;
 (C) the United Nations received 137 complaints of `torture, cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment';
 (D) among the abuses reported to the United Nations were sensory deprivation,
 immersion in a pit latrine, mock executions, overcrowding in special cells,
 deafening loudspeakers, keeping prisoners naked in front of relatives,
 and forcing a prisoner about to be executed to carry his own coffin or dig
 his own grave;
 (E) the United Nations commissioners also charged the Cuban regime with
 carrying out reprisals against Cuban citizens who offered testimony to
 the United Nations group, a clear violation of the Castro's government's
 promise not to harass those who complained about human rights;
 (F) at least 22 Cuban human rights activists who were arrested are currently
 serving prison sentences or being held without trial;
 (G) the Human Rights Commission approved a resolution on March 9, 1989,
 calling on the Cuban government to cooperate with the Secretary General of
 the United Nations in settling unresolved issues raised by the human rights
 study group;
 (H) since March 9, 1989, the United Nations has failed to take any substantive
 action to follow up on the March 9 resolution. The United Nations also has
 failed to intervene on behalf of those who are now imprisoned because of
 their attempts to testify before the United Nations human rights investigative
 group last fall.
 (2) STATEMENT OF POLICY- In the interest of promoting respect for human
 rights in Cuba, the Congress--
 (A) calls on the Secretary General of the United Nations to act upon
 the resolution approved by the Commission on Human Rights March 9, 1989,
 calling on the Secretary General to take appropriate follow up action on
 the Commission's report;
 (B) calls on the Secretary General to specifically urge the Cuban government
 to release the 22 persons still being held in detention because of their
 human rights activities;
 (C) calls on the United States Ambassador to the United Nations to make known
 in the strongest terms the dissatisfaction of the United States with the
 failure by the United Nations to continue to act on its own resolution; and
 (D) calls on the Secretary of the United Nations to expand the United
 Nation's investigation of Cuba to include an examination of labor rights
 in recognition of current Cuban law which prohibits the formation of
 independent unions and which has led to the imprisonment of those Cuban
 workers who have tried to organize themselves.
