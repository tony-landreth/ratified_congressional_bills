H.J.Res.429
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of December 10, 1989, through December 16, 1989, as
`National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week'.
Whereas traffic accidents cause more violent deaths in the United States
than any other cause, approximately 47,000 in 1988;
Whereas traffic accidents cause thousands of serious injuries in the United
States each year;
Whereas 37.5 percent of all drivers fatally injured in 1988 had blood alcohol
concentrations above the legal limit of .10;
Whereas the United States Surgeon General has reported that life expectancy
has risen for every age group over the past 75 years except for Americans
15 to 24 years old, whose death rate, the leading cause of which is drunk
driving, is higher now than it was 20 years ago;
Whereas the total societal cost of drunk driving has been estimated at more
than $26,000,000,000 per year, which does not include the human suffering
that can never be measured;
Whereas there are increasing reports of driving after drug use and accidents
involving drivers who have used marijuana or other illegal drugs;
Whereas driving after the use of therapeutic drugs, either alone or in
combination with alcohol, contrary to the advice of physician, pharmacist,
or manufacturer, may create a safety hazard on the roads;
Whereas more research is needed on the effect of drugs, either alone or in
combination with alcohol, on driving ability and the incidence of traffic
accidents;
Whereas an increased public awareness of the gravity of the problem of drugged
driving may warn drug users to refrain from driving and may stimulate interest
in increasing necessary research on the effect of drugs on driving ability
and the incidence of traffic accidents;
Whereas the public, particularly through the work of citizens groups, is
demanding a solution to the problem of drunk and drugged driving;
Whereas the best defense against the drunk or drugged driver is the use of
safety belts and consistent safety belt usage by all drivers and passengers
would save as many as 10,000 lives each year;
Whereas an increase in the public awareness of the problem of drunk and
drugged driving may contribute to a change in society's attitude toward
the drunk or drugged driver and help sustain current efforts to develop
comprehensive solutions at the State and local levels;
Whereas the Christmas and New Year holiday period, with more drivers on
the roads and an increased number of social functions, is a particularly
appropriate time to focus national attention on this critical problem;
Whereas designation of National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week in
each of the last 7 years stimulated many activities and programs by groups in
both the private and public sectors aimed at curbing drunk and drugged driving
in the high-risk Christmas and New Year holiday period and thereafter; and
Whereas the activities and programs during National Drunk and Drugged Driving
Awareness Week have heightened the awareness of the American public to the
danger of drunk and drugged driving: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of December 10, 1989, through
 December 16, 1989, is designated as `National Drunk and Drugged Driving
 Awareness Week' and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the
 week with appropriate activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
