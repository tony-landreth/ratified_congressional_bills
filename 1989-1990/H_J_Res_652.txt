H.J.Res.652
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
An Act
To designate March 25, 1991, as `National Medal of Honor Day'.
Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest distinction that can be awarded by
the President, in the name of the Congress, to members of the Armed Forces
who have distinguished themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity
at the risk of their lives above and beyond the call of duty;
Whereas only a few of the millions of men and women who have served the
Nation in war, military operations, or other armed conflicts have received
the Medal of Honor;
Whereas the 1st Medal of Honor awards were presented to 6 men on March 25,
1863, by the Secretary of War;
Whereas it is appropriate to honor the heroic recipients of the Medal of Honor;
Whereas public awareness of the importance of the Medal of Honor has declined
in recent years; and
Whereas the designation of National Medal of Honor Day will focus the
efforts of national, State, and local organizations striving to foster public
appreciation and recognition of Medal of Honor recipients: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1991, is designated as `National
 Medal of Honor Day', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe the
 day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
