AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating November 1989 as `An End to Hunger Education Month'.
Whereas hunger affects the lives of 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 people in
the world and takes the lives of 13,000,000 to 18,000,000 people annually,
three-fourths of whom are children under the age of 5;
Whereas while famines often gain widespread media attention and the subsequent
response of the public, little attention is focused on the problem of
chronic hunger;
Whereas there is a need to promote continuing activities that increase
education and heighten public awareness about the extent of hunger, its
causes, and consequences;
Whereas a society educated about the pervasiveness of hunger is equipped to
respond to the needs of hungry people around the world; and
Whereas schools and communities should conduct educational programs that lead
to the development of viable methods for alleviating hunger: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That November 1989 is designated as `An End to
 Hunger Education Month', and the President of the United States is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
