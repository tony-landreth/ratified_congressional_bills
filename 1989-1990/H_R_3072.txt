 a balanced response to Soviet anti-satellite capabilities, which includes
 a measured ASAT program;

 SEC. 9110. (a) Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States, as executive agent for the United Nations Command,
 plays a key role in preserving the armistice which has maintained peace on
 the Korean peninsula for 36 years.
 (2) Partly because of the significant contribution that the United States
 has made toward preserving the peace, the Republic of Korea has been able
 to focus national efforts on economic and political development.
 (3) The United States remains committed to the security and territorial
 integrity of the Republic of Korea under the terms of the Mutual Defense
 Treaty of 1954.
 (b) It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) until North Korea abandons its desire to reunite the Korean peninsula
 by force and ceases to seek modern weapon systems from foreign powers, the
 threat to the Republic of Korea will remain clear and present and the United
 States military presence in the Republic of Korea will continue to be vital
 to the deterrence of North Korean aggression toward the Republic of Korea;
 (2) although a United States military presence is essential until the Republic
 of Korea has achieved a balance of military power with the Democratic Peoples
 Republic of Korea, the United States should reassess the force structure
 required for the security of the Republic of Korea and the protection of
 the United States interests in northeast Asia;
 (3) the United States should not remove any armed forces from the Korean
 peninsula until a thorough study has been made of the present and projected
 roles, missions, and force levels of the United States forces in the Republic
 of Korea; and
 (4) before April 1, 1990, the President should submit to Congress a report
 that contains a detailed assessment of the need for a United States military
 presence in the Republic of Korea, including--
 (A) an assessment of (i) the current imbalance between the armed forces of
 the Republic of Korea and the armed forces of the Democratic Peoples Republic
 of Korea, and (ii) the efforts by the Republic of Korea to eliminate the
 current adverse imbalance;
 (B) the means by which the Republic of Korea can increase its contributions
 to its own defense and permit the United States to assume a supporting role
 in the defense of the Republic of Korea;
 (C) the ways in which the roles and missions of the United States forces
 in Korea are likely to be revised in order to reflect the anticipated
 increases in the national defense contributions of the Republic of Korea
 and to effectuate an equal partnership between the United States and the
 Republic of Korea in the common defense of the Republic of Korea;
 (D) an assessment of the actions taken by the Republic of Korea in conjunction
 with the United States to reduce the cost of stationing United States
 military forces in the Republic of Korea;
 (E) an assessment of the willingness of the South Korean people to sustain
 and support a continued United States military presence on the Korean
 peninsula; and
 (F) a discussion of the plans for a long-term United States military presence
 throughout the Pacific region, the anticipated national security threats in
 that region, the roles and missions of the Armed Forces of the United States
 for the protection of the national security interests of the United States in
 that region, the force structure necessary for the Armed Forces to perform
 those roles and missions, and any force restructuring that could result in
 a reduction in the cost of performing such roles and missions effectively.
