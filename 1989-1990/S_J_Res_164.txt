AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
Designating 1990 as the `International Year of Bible Reading'.
Whereas the Bible has made a unique contribution in shaping the United States
as a distinctive and blessed Nation and people;
Whereas deeply held values springing from the Bible led to the early settlement
of our Nation;
Whereas many of our great national leaders, such as Presidents Washington,
Jackson, Lincoln, and Wilson, paid tribute to the important influence the
Bible has had in the development of our Nation;
Whereas President Jackson called the Bible `the rock on which our Republic
rests';
Whereas the history of our Nation illustrates the value of voluntarily applying
the teachings of the Bible in the lives of individuals and of families; and
Whereas numerous individuals and organizations around the world are joining
hands to encourage international Bible reading in 1990: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That 1990 is designated as the `International
 Year of Bible Reading'. The President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation recognizing both the formative influence the Bible has had
 on many societies of the world and the value of the study of the Bible.
