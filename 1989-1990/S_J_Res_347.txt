Joint Resolution
Designating April 7 through 13, 1991, as `National County Government Week'.
Whereas county government is the oldest form of local government in the
United States;
Whereas 98 percent of the Nation's population reside in counties;
Whereas county governments employed over 1,900,000 people and spent almost
$103,000,000,000 last year to provide a wide range of services for the
benefit of the people of the United States;
Whereas county governments are often the last available resource for providing
emergency and long-term services for the poor, the homeless, immigrants,
refugees, the disadvantaged, and other segments of society;
Whereas county governments own and operate 1,000 health care facilities and
over 2,000 health departments;
Whereas almost 1,200 counties are now managed by appointed administrators
or elected executives;
Whereas over the last 30 years county governments have assumed increasing
responsibility for the administration and financing of health, welfare,
justice, transportation, housing, and community development programs; and
Whereas county governments have also been assigned a greater role in solving
area wide problems dealing with air pollution, water pollution, solid waste
disposal, airports, transit systems, regional parks, and other issues: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of April 7 through 13, 1991,
 is designated as `National County Government Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
