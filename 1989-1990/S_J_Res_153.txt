Joint Resolution
Designating the third week in May 1990 as `National Tourism Week'.
Whereas travel and tourism is the third largest retail industry and the
second largest private employer in the United States, generating more than
five million nine hundred thousand jobs;
Whereas total travel expenditures in the United States amount to more than
$350,000,000,000 annually, or about 6.7 percent of the Gross National Product;
Whereas tourism is an essential American export, as thirty-eight million
three hundred thousand foreign travelers spend approximately $43,000,000,000
annually in the United States;
Whereas development and promotion of tourism have brought new industries, jobs,
and economic revitalization to cities and regions across the United States;
Whereas tourism contributes substantially to personal growth, education,
appreciation of intercultural differences, and the enhancement of international
understanding and good will; and
Whereas the abundant natural and man-made attractions of the United States
and the hospitality of the American people establish the United States as
the preeminent destination for both foreign and domestic travelers: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning on the second
 Sunday in May 1990 is designated as `National Tourism Week'. The President is
