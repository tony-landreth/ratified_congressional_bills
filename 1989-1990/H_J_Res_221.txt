H.J.Res.221
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning September 1, 1989, as `World War II Remembrance
Week'.
Whereas on September 1, 1939, troops of the German Third Reich launched a
surprise attack upon Poland and began the military actions that led to World
War II;
Whereas the Governments of Japan, Italy, and other states subsequently joined
Nazi Germany in attacking their neighboring states to bolster their national
pride and achieve imperialistic economic advantages;
Whereas the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and many other nations
declared war upon the aggressors;
Whereas as a result of the six-year conflict that ensued over fifteen million
combatants were killed and over twenty-four million noncombatants died;
Whereas the warring nations suffered nearly $1,000,000,000,000 in costs
directly related to the conduct of the war, and the severe disruption and
dislocation of the conflict resulted in losses totaling many times that
amount to their economies;
Whereas as a result of the vicious racist policies of the Government of
Nazi Germany and some of its allies, millions of innocent men, women, and
children were murdered, including some six million Jews;
Whereas as a result of wartime fears and prejudices, millions of innocent
individuals were needlessly displaced, interned, harassed, placed under
suspicion, and deprived of their property by nations on both sides of the
conflict; and
Whereas as a consequence of technological innovations which came about as a
result of this war, devastating conventional weapons and the threat of nuclear
annihilation directly affect growing segments of civilian populations: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That in commemoration of the fiftieth
 anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, the week beginning September 1,
 1989, is designated `World War II Remembrance Week' and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe the period with appropriate programs,
 ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
