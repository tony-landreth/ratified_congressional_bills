S.J.Res.159
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate April 22, 1990, as Earth Day, and to set aside the day for public
activities promoting preservation of the global environment.
Whereas we face an international environmental crisis that demands the
attention of the American people and citizens of every nation in the world,
and we must build alliances that transcend the boundaries dividing countries,
continents, and cultures in order to solve it;
Whereas we need to confront environmental problems of increasing severity,
including climate change; depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer; loss
of forests, wetlands, and other wildlife habitats; acid rain; air pollution;
ocean pollution; and hazardous and solid waste buildup;
Whereas we must educate and encourage individuals to recognize the
environmental impact of their daily lives by becoming environmentally
responsible consumers, conserving energy, increasing recycling efforts,
and promoting environmental responsibility in their communities;
Whereas it will take major public policy initiatives to cure the causes
of environmental degredation, such as phasing out the manufacture and use
of chlorofluorocarbons, minimizing and recycling solid wastes, improving
energy efficiency, protecting biodiversity, promoting reforestation, and
moving toward sustainable development throughout the world;
Whereas almost twenty years ago, millions of Americans joined together on
Earth Day to express an unprecedented concern for the environment, and their
collective action resulted in the passage of sweeping laws to protect our air,
our water, and the lands around us;
Whereas we must make the 1990s an `International Environment Decade', and forge
an international alliance to respond to global environmental problems; and
Whereas to inaugurate this environmental decade, we must once again stand
up together in cities, towns, and villages around the world for a day of
collective action to declare our shared resolve: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 22, 1990, shall be designated
 and proclaimed as Earth Day, and that the day shall be set aside for public
 activities promoting preservation of the global environment.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
