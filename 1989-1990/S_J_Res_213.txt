one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate October 22 through October 29, 1989, as `National Red Ribbon
Week for a Drug-Free America'.
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions and
is of major concern to all Americans;
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse is a major public health threat and is
one of the largest causes of preventable disease, disability, and death in
the United States today;
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse costs American society nearly
$100,000,000,000 a year;
Whereas illegal drug use does not discriminate on the basis of age, gender,
or socioeconomic status, as evidenced by the facts that--
 (1) 23,000,000 Americans age 12 and over currently use illicit drugs;
 (2) a nationwide Weekly Reader survey revealed that of the 68,000 fourth
 graders polled, 34 percent reported peer pressure to try wine coolers,
 41 percent to smoke, and 24 percent to use crack or cocaine; and
 (3) the 15- to 24-year-old group is dying at a faster rate than any other
 age group because of accidents, homicides, and suicides, many of which are
 related to drug and alcohol abuse;
Whereas the drug problem appears to be insurmountable, but Americans have
begun to lay the foundation to combat it;
Whereas we must continue the important strides we have made in our efforts
to prevent alcohol and other drug abuse;
Whereas the most recent national polls reveal that progress has been made
in that--
 (1) since 1979, there has been a steady decline in the use of marijuana on
 a daily basis among high school seniors, and in 1987, marijuana use among
 this group was at its lowest level in 11 years;
 (2) in 1987 there was a significant drop in the use of cocaine, and the
 number of high school seniors associating great risk with trying cocaine
 once or twice rose from 34 percent in 1986 to 48 percent in 1987; and
 (3) illicit drug use of stimulants and sedatives continues to decline among
 high school seniors, college students, and young adults in general;
Whereas according to public opinion polls the American people consider that
drug abuse is one of the most serious domestic problems facing this Nation
and have begun to take steps to fight it;
Whereas the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth has declared
October 22 through October 29, 1989, as `National Red Ribbon Week for a
Drug-Free America', and has called for a comprehensive public awareness,
prevention, and education program involving thousands of parent and community
groups across the country;
Whereas other outstanding groups, including the National Parents Resource
Institute for Drug Education, the Council for Drug Education, Just Say No
International, the National Crime Prevention Council, the Chiefs of Police
National Drug Task Force, the National Hispanic Family Against Drug Abuse,
national youth organizations, national service organizations, and others,
have demonstrated leadership, creativity, and determination in achieving a
drug-free America;
Whereas any use of an illegal drug is unacceptable, and the illegal use of
a legal drug cannot be tolerated; and
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse destroys lives, spawns rampant crime,
undermines our economy, and threatens our national security: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 22 through October
 29, 1989, is designated as `National Red Ribbon Week for a Drug-Free
 America'. The United States recognizes and commends the hard work and
 dedication of concerned parents, youth, law enforcement, educators, business
 leaders, religious leaders, private sector organizations, and Government
 leaders, and urges that meetings, conferences, and fundraising activities
 that support community and alcohol education take place during National
 Red Ribbon Week for a Drug-Free America with other appropriate activities,
 events, and educational campaigns. Every American is encouraged to wear and
 display red ribbons during National Red Ribbon Week for a Drug-Free America
 to present and symbolize their commitment to a healthy, drug-free lifestyle,
 and to develop an attitude of intolerance concerning the use of drugs.
