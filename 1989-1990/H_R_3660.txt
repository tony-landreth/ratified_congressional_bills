 report the information required to be reported pursuant to subsections (a),
 (b), and (c) of this section with respect to the holdings of and the income
 from a trust or other financial arrangement from which income is received
 by, or with respect to which a beneficial interest in principal or income
 is held by, such individual, his spouse, or any dependent child.

 dependent child, and
 `(ii) the holdings or sources of income of which such individual, his spouse,
 and any dependent child have no knowledge of; or

 needs of the interested party (including, but not limited to, an interest
 in maximizing income or long-term capital gain), (II) to the notification of
 the trustee of a law or regulation subsequently applicable to the reporting
 individual which prohibits the interested party from holding an asset, which
 notification directs that the asset not be held by the trust, or (III) to
 directions to the trustee to sell all of an asset initially placed in the
 trust by an interested party which in the determination of the reporting
 individual creates a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof due
 to the subsequent assumption of duties by the reporting individual (but
 nothing herein shall require any such direction); and
 `(vii) the interested parties shall make no effort to obtain information
 with respect to the holdings of the trust, including obtaining a copy of
 any trust tax return filed or any information relating thereto except as
 otherwise provided in this subsection.

 substantial activities in the area of the reporting individual's primary

 Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency, or any individual

 compromise the national interest of the United States. In addition, such

 to recover the cost of reproduction or mailing of such report excluding any
 salary of any employee involved in such reproduction or mailing. A copy of

 this section to any person nor may any copy thereof be provided under this
 section to any person except upon a written application by such person
 stating--

 be in addition to any other remedy available under statutory or common law.

 the report pursuant to section 101(c) and was not subsequently elected,
 such reports shall be destroyed one year after the individual either is

 `(a)(1) In order to ensure that the performance of career appointees
 demonstrates the excellence needed to meet the goals of the Senior Executive
 Service, as set forth in section 3131, each career appointee shall be
 subject to recertification by the employing agency in accordance with the
 provisions of this section.
 `(2) Beginning in calendar year 1991, and recurring every third calendar
 year thereafter, the head of an agency shall determine a time during such
 calendar year when the performance of career appointees in the agency shall
 be subject to recertification. Recertification shall not be required of any
 career appointee who has not been continuously employed as a senior executive
 for the 156 weeks preceding the time determined for the recertification. For
 the purposes of the previous sentence, a break in service of 6 months shall
 be deemed not to interrupt the 156 weeks of continuous employment.
 `(b) The supervising official of each career appointee shall submit to a
 performance review board established by the agency under section 4314 a
 recommendation as to whether the career appointee's performance justifies
 recertification as a senior executive, based on such factors as the career
 appointee's performance ratings for the 3 preceding years under section
 4314, any award or other recognition received by the career appointee, any
 developmental activities of the career appointee, and any other relevant
 factors. The supervising official's recommendation shall reflect that
 official's view as to whether the career appointee's overall performance
 over the 3 preceding years has demonstrated the excellence expected of a
 senior executive in relation to the written performance requirements for the
 career appointee's senior executive position as established under section
 4312(b). The career appointee may submit to the performance review board
 a statement of accomplishments and other documentation giving evidence of
 the quality of the career appointee's performance.
 `(c)(1) After considering the recommendation and other information received
 under subsection (b), the performance review board shall submit to the
 appointing authority a recommendation as to whether the career appointee
 should be recertified, conditionally recertified, or not recertified
 as a senior executive. If the board proposes to recommend conditional
 recertification or nonrecertification, then the affected appointee shall be
 so notified and shall have the opportunity to appear before the performance
 review board. If the board is recommending that the career appointee be
 recertified, the board may also recommend that the career appointee's
 rate of basic pay be increased to a higher rate established under section
 5382. If the board is recommending that the career appointee be conditionally
 recertified, the board may recommend that the career appointee's pay be
 reduced to the next lower rate established under section 5382. The board
 shall also provide to the appointing authority the recommendation and other
 information received under subsection (b).
 `(2) More than one-half of the members of a performance review board under
 this section shall consist of career appointees. The requirement of the
 preceding sentence shall not apply in any case in which the Office of
 Personnel Management determines that there exists an insufficient number
 of career appointees available to comply with the requirement.
 `(d)(1) If the appointing authority determines that the career appointee's
 performance during the preceding 3 years demonstrates the excellence expected
 of a senior executive, the appointing authority shall recommend to the head
 of the agency that the career appointee be recertified as a senior executive.
 `(2) If the appointing authority determines that the career appointee's
 performance has not demonstrated the excellence expected of a senior
 executive, the appointing authority shall recommend to the head of the
 agency that the career appointee be conditionally recertified as a senior
 executive or not be recertified as a senior executive.
 `(e)(1) If the head of the agency decides that the career appointee's
 performance warrants recertification as a senior executive, the career
 appointee shall continue in the Senior Executive Service. If a career
 appointee is recertified as a senior executive, the career appointee's rate
 of basic pay may not be reduced at the time of recertification.
 `(2) If the head of the agency decides that the career appointee's
 performance does not warrant full recertification, but does warrant
 conditional recertification, the career appointee--
 `(A) shall remain a career appointee in the Senior Executive Service;
 `(B) shall be subject to continuing close review of the career appointee's
 performance by the supervising official in coordination with an executive
 resources board established under section 3393, in accordance with a
 performance improvement plan developed by the supervising official and
 subject to the approval of the executive resources board;
 `(C) may, if the head of the agency so determines, be reduced to the next
 lower rate of basic pay established under section 5382; and
 `(D) shall be removed from the Senior Executive Service if the career
 appointee is not recertified as a senior executive at the end of the 12-month
 period following the conditional recertification.
If, at the end of the 12-month period following the conditional
recertification, the career appointee is recertified as a senior executive,
any reduction that was made in the career appointee's rate of basic pay
under subparagraph (C) shall be restored prospectively.
 `(3) If the head of the agency decides that the career appointee's performance
 does not demonstrate that the career appointee qualifies for recertification
 or conditional recertification as a senior executive, the career appointee
 shall be removed from the Senior Executive Service in accordance with
 section 3592.
 `(f) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe standards
 and procedures to ensure consistency and fairness for the process of
 recertification under this section.'.
