One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

Joint Resolution
To establish a national policy on permanent papers.
Whereas it is now widely recognized and scientifically demonstrated that
the acidic papers commonly used for more than a century in documents, books,
and other publications are self-destructing and will continue to self destruct;
Whereas Americans are facing the prospect of continuing to lose national,
historical, scientific, and scholarly records, including government records,
faster than salvage efforts can be mounted despite the dedicated efforts of
many libraries, archives, and agencies, such as the Library of Congress and
the National Archives and Records Administration;
Whereas nationwide hundreds of millions of dollars will have to be spent
by the Federal, State, and local governments and private institutions to
salvage the most essential books and other materials in the libraries and
archives of government, academic, and private institutions;
Whereas paper manufacturers can produce a sufficient supply of acid free
permanent papers with a life of several hundred years, at prices competitive
with acid papers, if publishers would specify the use of such papers, and
some publishers and many university presses are already publishing on acid
free permanent papers;
Whereas most Government agencies do not require the use of acid free permanent
papers for appropriate Federal records and publications;
Whereas librarians, publishers, and other professional groups have urged
the use of acid free permanent papers;
Whereas even when books are printed on acid free permanent paper this fact
is often not made known to libraries by notations in the book or by notations
in standard bibliographic listings; and
Whereas there is an urgent need to prevent the continuance of the acid paper
problem in the future: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled,
 SECTION 1. It is the policy of the United States that Federal records, books,
 and publications of enduring value be produced on acid free permanent papers.
 SEC. 2. The Congress of the United States urgently recommends that--
 (1) Federal agencies require the use of acid free permanent papers for
 publications of enduring value produced by the Government Printing Office
 or produced by Federal grant or contract, using the specifications for such
 paper established by the Joint Committee on Printing;
 (2) Federal agencies require the use of archival quality acid free papers for
 permanently valuable Federal records and confer with the National Archives
 and Records Administration on the requirements for paper quality;
 (3) American publishers and State and local governments use acid free
 permanent papers for publications of enduring value, in voluntary compliance
 with the American National Standard;
 (4) all publishers, private and governmental, prominently note the use of
 acid free permanent paper in books, advertisements, catalogs, and standard
 bibliographic listings; and
 (5) the Secretary of State, Librarian of Congress, Archivist of the
 United States, and other Federal officials make known the national policy
 regarding acid free permanent papers to foreign governments and appropriate
 international agencies since the acid paper problem is worldwide and essential
 foreign materials being imported by our libraries are printed on acid papers.
 SEC. 3. The Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and
 the Public Printer shall jointly monitor the Federal Government's progress
 in implementing the national policy declared in section 1 regarding acid
 free permanent papers and shall report to the Congress regarding such
 progress on December 31, 1991, December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1995. In
 carrying out the monitoring and reporting functions under this section,
 the Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and the
 Public Printer may consult with the National Endowment for the Humanities,
 National Agricultural Library, National Library of Medicine, other Federal
 and State agencies, international organizations, private publishers, paper
 manufacturers, and other organizations with an interest in preservation of
 books and historical papers.
