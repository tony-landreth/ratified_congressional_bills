AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To grant the consent of Congress to the boundary change compact between
South Dakota and Nebraska.
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That (a) the consent of Congress is hereby
 given to--
 (1) the South Dakota-Nebraska Boundary Compact, approved by the State of South
 Dakota on March 14, 1989, and by the State of Nebraska on May 25, 1989; and
 (2) the establishment of the boundary between the States of South Dakota
 and Nebraska agreed to in the compact referred to in paragraph (1).
 (b) The South Dakota-Nebraska Boundary Compact is substantially as follows:
SOUTH DAKOTA-NEBRASKA BOUNDARY COMPACT
 WHEREAS, the Missouri River has constituted the territorial boundary between
 the state of Nebraska and the state of South Dakota common to Dakota County,
 Nebraska, and Union County, South Dakota; and,
 WHEREAS, by the forces of nature and construction, operation and maintenance
 efforts by agencies of the federal government, the flow of the Missouri
 River has changed its course, and the main channel of the river has changed
 its position in many areas along the boundary between said counties of the
 states; and,
 WHEREAS, disputes between the state of Nebraska and the state of South Dakota,
 their political and governmental subdivisions, citizens and other persons
 have arisen with respect to the location of the true boundary between said
 counties of the states; and,
 WHEREAS, there has for many years existed as between said counties of the
 states, a question as to the true and correct boundary line between them; and,
 WHEREAS, in some areas land is taxed or may be taxed by governmental bodies
 in both states and in other areas land may be untaxed by governmental bodies
 in either state; and,
 WHEREAS, at times courts have found some land as located in Nebraska, at other
 times the courts have found the same land as located in South Dakota; and,
 WHEREAS, the Missouri River is now relatively stabilized by work done under
 the direction and supervision of the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
 and a boundary based upon the present main channel of the Missouri River
 would be, if the works are properly maintained, as near as can be anticipated
 at this time, fixed and permanent; and,
 WHEREAS, it is to the best interest of the states of Nebraska and South
 Dakota, their political and governmental subdivisions and their citizens, to
 determine a new and compromise boundary between said counties of the states,
 to avoid litigation and multiple exercises of sovereignty and jurisdiction,
 to encourage the optimum beneficial use of the river, its facilities and
 its waters, and to remove all causes of controversy between said states
 with respect to the boundary between said counties of the states; and,
 WHEREAS, the states by entering into an agreement for a new boundary are
 not recognizing and do not desire to recognize the former compact boundary
 established between them by their legislative actions and the consent of
 the Congress in 1905; and,
 WHEREAS, because of the numerous natural cutoffs over the years and
 the construction and stabilization work by the Corps of Engineers, which
 included the dredging of channels and construction of dikes and revetments,
 thus moving the river around and across islands, bar areas, and lands,
 as between the states, neither of them recognizes any presumption that the
 river has moved gradually into the present designed channel location; and,
 WHEREAS, the states recognize that the Corps of Engineers' activities have
 caused tracts of land formerly on one side of the river to be isolated on
 the other side, and the states recognize there may have been many natural
 cutoffs of the Missouri River prior to the stabilization work by the Corps
 of Engineers; and,
 WHEREAS, as to lands along or in proximity to the Missouri River, the
 states desire not to disturb private titles or claims which may have been
 established by individuals by recognizing or locating any specific areas
 as belonging to or being within one state or the other; instead the states
 desire to leave any questions of private titles to the parties involved; and,
 WHEREAS, the terms of this compact shall be binding upon the states, their
 political and governmental subdivisions and officers and agents thereof; and,
 WHEREAS, the parties recognize that the present main channel of the Missouri
 River as it exists within the designed channel stabilized by the Corps of
 Engineers is or may be different from a line parallel and equidistant from
 the present banks of the Missouri River; and,
 WHEREAS, the states of Nebraska and South Dakota have agreed upon the terms
 and provisions of a compact to establish the boundary between said counties
 of the state.
 To these ends, duly appointed commissioners for the state of Nebraska and
 the state of South Dakota jointly convened on February 24, 1989, in Lincoln,
 Nebraska, and have resolved to conclude a compact, following enactment by
 their respective legislative bodies and with consent of the Congress of
 the United States, and have agreed upon the following Articles:
ARTICLE I. Findings and Purposes
 (a) The state of Nebraska and the state of South Dakota find that there have
 been actual and potential disputes, controversies, criminal proceedings and
 litigation arising or which may arise out of the location of the boundary
 line between Dakota County, Nebraska, and Union County, South Dakota; that
 the Missouri River constituting the boundary between said counties of the
 states has changed its course from time to time, and that the United States
 Army Corps of Engineers has established a designed channel of the river for
 navigation and other purposes, which is described and shown in the survey
 referred to in Article II.
 (b) It is the principal purpose of the states in executing this compact to
 establish an identifiable compromise boundary between said counties of the
 states for the entire distance thereof as of the effective date of this
 compact without interfering with or otherwise affecting private rights or
 titles to property, and the states declare that further compelling purposes
 of this compact are: (1) to create a friendly and harmonious interstate
 relationship; (2) to avoid multiple exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction
 including matters of taxation, judicial and police powers and exercise of
 administrative authority; (3) to encourage settlement and disposition of
 pending litigation and criminal proceedings and avoid or minimize future
 disputes and litigations; (4) to promote economic and political stability;
 (5) to encourage the optimum mutual beneficial use of the Missouri River,
 its waters and its facilities; (6) to establish a forum for settlement
 of future disputes; (7) to place the boundary in a new or reestablished
 location which can be identified or located; and (8) to express the intent
 and policy of the states that the common boundary between said counties
 be established within the confines of the Missouri River and both states
 shall continue to have access to and use of the waters of the river.
ARTICLE II. Establishment of Boundary
 (a) The permanent compromise boundary line between said counties of the states
 shall be fixed at the centerline of the designed channel of the Missouri River
 (the westerly channel adjacent to Section 5, Township 29 North, Range 7 East
 of the 6th P.M. shall be considered the main channel). The state of Nebraska
 and the state of South Dakota by the ratification of this document agree
 to accurately describe the centerline of the design channel by reference
 to permanent monuments which shall be placed at locations which are easily
 accessible and safe from destruction. The Nebraska State Surveyors Office
 and a representative from South Dakota shall jointly supervise and approve
 placement of the monuments and the location of the compact boundary. Upon
 completion, the maps and record of the survey shall be incorporated herein
 and made a part hereof by reference. Said maps shall be placed on file
 with the secretaries of state of South Dakota and Nebraska. The approval of
 contracts and all necessary costs for the accurate survey and placement of
 proper monuments shall be shared equally between the states of South Dakota
 and Nebraska.
 (b) This centerline of the channel of the Missouri River as described on
 said survey shall hereinafter be referred to as the `compromise boundary.'
ARTICLE III. Relinquishment of Sovereignty
 On the effective date of this compact, the state of South Dakota hereby
 relinquishes to the state of Nebraska all sovereignty over lands lying on
 the Nebraska side of said compromise boundary and the state of Nebraska
 hereby relinquishes to the state of South Dakota all sovereignty over lands
 lying on the South Dakota side of the compromise boundary.
ARTICLE IV. Pending Litigation
 Nothing in this compact shall be deemed or construed to affect any litigation
 pending in the courts of either of the states concerning title to any of
 the lands, sovereignty over which is relinquished by the state of South
 Dakota to the state of Nebraska or by the state of Nebraska to the state
 of South Dakota and any matter concerning the title to lands, sovereignty
 over which is relinquished by either state to the other, may be continued
 in the courts of the state where pending until a final determination thereof.
ARTICLE V. Public Records
 (a) On and following the effective date of this compact, the public record of
 real estate titles, mortgages and other liens in the state of Nebraska to any
 lands, the sovereignty over which is relinquished by the state of Nebraska
 to the state of South Dakota, shall be accepted as evidence of record title
 to such lands, to and including the effective date of such relinquishment
 by the state of Nebraska, by the courts of the state of South Dakota.
 (b) On and following the effective date of this compact, the public record of
 real estate titles, mortgages and other liens in the state of South Dakota to
 any lands, the sovereignty over which is relinquished by the state of South
 Dakota to the state of Nebraska, shall be accepted as evidence of record title
 to such lands, to and including the effective date of such relinquishment
 by the state of South Dakota, by the courts of the state of Nebraska.
 (c) As to lands, the sovereignty over which is relinquished, on the effective
 date of this compact the recording officials of each state including the
 counties thereof shall accept for filing documents of title using legal
 descriptions derived from the land descriptions of the other state. The
 acceptance of such documents for filing shall have no bearing upon the
 legal effect or sufficiency thereof.
ARTICLE VI. Taxes
 (a) Taxes for the calendar year of the effective date of this compact which
 are lawfully imposed by either Nebraska or South Dakota may be levied and
 collected by such state or its authorized governmental subdivisions and
 agencies on land, subsequent jurisdiction over which is relinquished by the
 taxing state to the other, and any liens or other rights accrued or accruing,
 including the right of collection, shall be fully recognized and the county
 treasurers of the said counties or other taxing authorities affected shall
 act as agents in carrying out the provisions of this Article; provided,
 that all liens or other rights arising out of the imposition of taxes,
 accrued or accruing as aforesaid, shall be claimed or asserted within five
 years after this compact becomes effective and if not so claimed or asserted
 shall be forever barred.
 (b) The lands, sovereignty over which is relinquished by the state of South
 Dakota to the state of Nebraska, shall not thereafter be subject to the
 imposition of taxes in the state of South Dakota from and after the calendar
 year of the effective date of this compact. The lands, sovereignty over which
 is relinquished by the state of Nebraska to the state of South Dakota, shall
 not thereafter be subject to the imposition of taxes in the state of Nebraska
 from and after the calendar year of the effective date of this compact.
ARTICLE VII. Private Rights
 (a) This compact shall not deprive any riparian owner of such riparian
 owner's rights based upon riparian law and the establishment of the compromise
 boundary between said counties of the state shall not in any way be deemed
 to change or affect the boundary line or riparian owners along the Missouri
 River as between such owners. The establishment of the compromise boundary
 shall not operate to limit such riparian owner's rights to accretions across
 such compromise boundary.
 (b) No private individual or entity claiming title to lands along the
 Missouri River, over which sovereignty is relinquished by this compact,
 shall be prejudiced by the relinquishment of such sovereignty and any claims
 or possessory rights necessary to establish adverse possession shall not
 be terminated or limited by the fact that the jurisdiction over such lands
 may have been transferred by the compact. Neither state will assert any
 claim of title to abandoned beds of the Missouri River, lands along the
 Missouri River, or the bed of the Missouri River based upon any doctrine
 of state ownership of the beds or abandoned beds of navigable waters,
 as against any land owners or claimants claiming interest in real estate
 arising out of titles, muniments of title, or exercises of jurisdiction
 of or from the other state, which titles or muniments of title commenced
 prior to the effective date of this compact.
ARTICLE VIII. Readjustment of Boundary by Negotiation
 If at any time after the effective date of this compact, the Missouri River
 shall move or be moved by natural means or otherwise so that the flow thereof
 at any point along the course forming the boundary between the states occurs
 entirely within one of the states, each state at the request of the other,
 agrees to enter into and conduct negotiations in good faith for the purpose
 of readjusting the boundary at the place or places where such movement
 occurred consistent with the intent, policy and purpose hereof that the
 boundary will be placed within the Missouri River.
ARTICLE IX. Effective Date
 (a) This compact shall become effective when ratified by the legislature
 of the state of Nebraska and the legislature of the state of South Dakota
 and approved by the Congress of the United States.
 (b) As of the effective date of this compact, the state of Nebraska and the
 state of South Dakota shall relinquish sovereignty over the lands described
 herein and shall assume and accept sovereignty over such lands ceded to
 them as herein provided.
 (c) In the event this compact is not approved by the legislature of each
 state on or before July, 1990, and approved by the Congress of the United
 States within three years from the date hereof, this compact shall be
 inoperative and for all purposes shall be void.
ARTICLE X. Enforcement
 Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent either state
 from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable,
 in any court having jurisdiction, for the protection of any right under
 this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.
