 a group of benefits consistent with subsection (p).
 `(2) If the medicare supplemental policy provides for coverage of a 
group of benefits other than the core group of basic benefits described in subse
ction (p)(2)(B), the issuer of the policy must make available to the individual 
a medicare supplemental policy with only such core group of basic benefits.

 `(3) The issuer of the policy has provided, before the sale of the p
olicy, an outline of coverage that uses uniform language and format (including l
ayout and print size) that facilitates comparison among medicare supplemental po

s.
 `(B) If the Association does not promulgate NAIC standards within the 9-

e are changed and the Secretary determines, in consultation with the Association

f standards previously established in the same manner as they applied to the ori
ginal establishment of such standards.

er the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalt
y or proceeding under section 1128A(a).

e for a period of less than 30 days).
 `(ii) FALSE INFORMATION- Any manufacturer with an agreement 
under this section that knowingly provides false information is subject to a civ
il money penalty in an amount not to exceed $100,000 for each item of false info

this title, the State shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of prov
iders of home and community care and community care settings with the applicable

ssue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its r
esponsibility under this subsection.
 `(B) RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY- The Secretary shall be r
esponsible for certifying the compliance of State providers of home and communit
y care, and of State community care settings in which such care is provided, wit
h the requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h).
 `(C) FREQUENCY OF CERTIFICATIONS- Certification of providers and
 settings under this subsection shall occur no less frequently than once every 1
2 months.
 `(2) REVIEWS OF PROVIDERS-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The certification under this subsection with re

cordance with the requirements of subsection (f).
 `(B) SPECIAL REVIEWS OF COMPLIANCE- Where the Secretary has reas
on to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any o
f the requirements of subsection (f), the Secretary may conduct a review of the 
provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determin
ations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.

 `(3) Surveys of community care settings-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The certification under this subsection with re
spect to community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such

 who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or
 date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil 
money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1128A (other th
an subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previ
ous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceed
ing under section 1128A(a). The Secretary shall review each State's procedures f
or scheduling and conducting such surveys to assure that the State has taken all
 reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling
 procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.
 `(B) SURVEY PROTOCOL- Surveys under this paragraph shall be cond
ucted based upon a protocol which the Secretary has provided for under subsectio

dequacies of each State's surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conductin
g such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State i
s required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an in
dividual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g), but the Secretary det
ermines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determ
ination as to the setting's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and 
supersedes that of the State survey.
 `(E) SPECIAL SURVEYS OF COMPLIANCE- Where the Secretary has reas
on to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requir
ements of subsection (g) or (h), the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setti

in such setting and of misappropriation of individual property by such individua
ls. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable op
portunity for hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as
 to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that an individual has n
eglected or abused an individual receiving community care or misappropriated suc
h individual's property, the State shall notify the individual against whom the 
finding is made. A State shall not make a finding that a person has neglected an
 individual receiving community care if the person demonstrates that such neglec
t was caused by factors beyond the control of the person. The State shall provid
e for public disclosure of findings under this paragraph upon request and for in
clusion, in any such disclosure of such findings, of any brief statement (or of 
a clear and accurate summary thereof) of the individual disputing such findings.

 State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1903(q))
 with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys, rev

 `(A) IN GENERAL- If a State finds, on the basis of a review unde
r subsection (i)(2) or otherwise, that a provider of home or community care no l
onger meets the requirements of this section, the State may terminate the provid
er's participation under the State plan and may provide in addition for a civil 
money penalty. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting th
e remedies available to a State to remedy a provider's deficiencies. If the Stat
e finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, di
d not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty un
der paragraph (2)(A) for the period during which it finds that the provider was 
not in compliance with such requirements.
 `(B) CIVIL MONEY PENALTY-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Each State shall establish by law (whether 
statute or regulation) at least the following remedy: A civil money penalty asse

out of compliance with a requirement of this section. Funds collected by a State
 as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition b
y the State of a civil money penalty under subsection (i)(3)(A)) may be applied 
to reimbursement of individuals for personal funds lost due to a failure of home
 or community care providers to meet the requirements of this section. The State
 also shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied an
d the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimiz
e the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the 
penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe pena
lties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.
 `(ii) DEADLINE AND GUIDANCE- Each State which elects to prov
ide home and community care under this section must establish the civil money pe
nalty remedy described in clause (i) applicable to all providers of community ca
re covered under this section. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations 
or otherwise by not later than July 1, 1990, guidance to States in establishing 
such remedy; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not
 relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedy.
 `(2) SECRETARIAL AUTHORITY-
 `(A) FOR STATE PROVIDERS- With respect to a State provider of ho
me or community care, the Secretary shall have the authority and duties of a Sta
te under this subsection, except that the civil money penalty remedy described i
n subparagraph (C) shall be substituted for the civil money remedy described in 
paragraph (1)(B)(i).
 `(B) OTHER PROVIDERS- With respect to any other provider of home
 or community care in a State, if the Secretary finds that a provider no longer 
meets a requirement of this section, the Secretary may terminate the provider's 
participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for a civil mon
ey penalty under subparagraph (C). If the Secretary finds that a provider meets 
such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements,

he period during which the Secretary finds that the provider was not in complian
ce with such requirements.

 a review under subsection (i)(2) or otherwise that a home or community care pro
vider no longer meets the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall impo
se a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of nonc
ompliance. The provisions of section 1128A (other than subsections (a) and (b)) 
shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same man
ner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1128A(a). 
The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be ap
plied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to
 minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition
 of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more sev
ere penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.

Subtitle C--Amendments to Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972
SEC. 6201. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the `Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendment
s of 1990'.
SEC. 6202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE OF THIS SUBTITLE.
(a) FINDINGS- Congress finds and declares the following:
 (1) Our oceans, coastal waters, and estuaries constitute a unique re
source. The condition of the water quality in and around the coastal areas is si
gnificantly declining. Growing human pressures on the coastal ecosystem will con
tinue to degrade this resource until adequate actions and policies are implement
ed.
 (2) Almost one-half of our total population now lives in coastal are
as. By 2010, the coastal population will have grown from 80,000,000 in 1960 to 1
27,000,000 people, an increase of approximately 60 percent, and population densi
ty in coastal counties will be among the highest in the Nation.
 (3) Marine resources contribute to the Nation's economic stability. 
Commercial and recreational fishery activities support an industry with an estim
ated value of $12,000,000,000 a year.
 (4) Wetlands play a vital role in sustaining the coastal economy and
 environment. Wetlands support and nourish fishery and marine resources. They al
so protect the Nation's shores from storm and wave damage. Coastal wetlands cont
ribute an estimated $5,000,000,000 to the production of fish and shellfish in th
e United States coastal waters. Yet, 50 percent of the Nation's coastal wetlands
 have been destroyed, and more are likely to decline in the near future.
 (5) Nonpoint source pollution is increasingly recognized as a signif
icant factor in coastal water degradation. In urban areas, storm water and combi
ned sewer overflow are linked to major coastal problems, and in rural areas, run
-off from agricultural activities may add to coastal pollution.
 (6) Coastal planning and development control measures are essential 
to protect coastal water quality, which is subject to continued ongoing stresses
. Currently, not enough is being done to manage and protect our coastal resource
s.
 (7) Global warming results from the accumulation of man-made gases, 
released into the atmosphere from such activities as the burning of fossil fuels
, deforestation, and the production of chlorofluorocarbons, which trap solar hea
t in the atmosphere and raise temperatures worldwide. Global warming could resul
t in significant global sea level rise by 2050 resulting from ocean expansion, t
he melting of snow and ice, and the gradual melting of the polar ice cap. Sea le
vel rise will result in the loss of natural resources such as beaches, dunes, es
tuaries, and wetlands, and will contribute to the salinization of drinking water
 supplies. Sea level rise will also result in damage to properties, infrastructu
res, and public works. There is a growing need to plan for sea level rise.<
/ul>
 (8) There is a clear link between coastal water quality and land use
 activities along the shore. State management programs under the Coastal Zone Ma
nagement Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) are among the best tools for prote
cting coastal resources and must play a larger role, particularly in improving c
oastal zone water quality.
 (9) All coastal States should have coastal zone management programs 
in place that conform to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended by 
this Act.
(b) PURPOSE- It is the purpose of Congress in this subtitle to enhance the ef
fectiveness of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 by increasing our underst
anding of the coastal environment and expanding the ability of State coastal zon
e management programs to address coastal environmental problems.
SEC. 6203. FINDINGS AND POLICY OF COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1972.
(a) FINDINGS- (1) Section 302(d) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (

n into the coastal zone, may significantly affect the quality of coastal waters 
and habitats, and efforts to control coastal water pollution from land use activ
ities must be improved.
`(l) Because global warming may result in a substantial sea level rise with s
erious adverse effects in the coastal zone, coastal states must anticipate and p
lan for such an occurrence.
`(m) Because of their proximity to and reliance upon the ocean and its resour
ces, the coastal states have substantial and significant interests in the protec
tion, management, and development of the resources of the exclusive economic zon
e that can only be served by the active participation of coastal states in all F
ederal programs affecting such resources and, wherever appropriate, by the devel
opment of state ocean resource plans as part of their federally approved coastal
 zone management programs.'.

 `(K) the study and development, in any case in which the Secreta
ry considers it to be appropriate, of plans for addressing the adverse effects u
pon the coastal zone of land subsidence and of sea level rise; and'.
(5) Section 303(3) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1452
(3)) is amended by inserting `including those areas likely to be affected by lan
d subsidence, sea level rise, or fluctuating water levels of the Great Lakes,' i

l management information, research results, and technical assistance, to support
 State and Federal regulation of land use practices affecting the coastal and oc
ean resources of the United States; and
 `(6) to respond to changing circumstances affecting the coastal envi
ronment and coastal resource management by encouraging States to consider such i
ssues as ocean uses potentially affecting the coastal zone.'.I72SEC. 6204. DEFIN
ITIONS.

SEC. 6601. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the `Pollution Prevention Act of 1990'.
SEC. 6602. FINDINGS AND POLICY.
(a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that:
 (1) The United States of America annually produces millions of tons 
of pollution and spends tens of billions of dollars per year controlling this po
llution.
 (2) There are significant opportunities for industry to reduce or pr
event pollution at the source through cost-effective changes in production, oper
ation, and raw materials use. Such changes offer industry substantial savings in
 reduced raw material, pollution control, and liability costs as well as help pr
otect the environment and reduce risks to worker health and safety.
 (3) The opportunities for source reduction are often not realized be
cause existing regulations, and the industrial resources they require for compli
ance, focus upon treatment and disposal, rather than source reduction; existing 
regulations do not emphasize multi-media management of pollution; and businesses
 need information and technical assistance to overcome institutional barriers to
 the adoption of source reduction practices.
 (4) Source reduction is fundamentally different and more desirable t
han waste management and pollution control. The Environmental Protection Agency 
needs to address the historical lack of attention to source reduction.
 (5) As a first step in preventing pollution through source reduction
, the Environmental Protection Agency must establish a source reduction program 
which collects and disseminates information, provides financial assistance to St
ates, and implements the other activities provided for in this subtitle.
(b) POLICY- The Congress hereby declares it to be the national policy of the 
United States that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenev
er feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environ
mentally safe manner, whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented or r
ecycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; a
nd disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a l
ast resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.

 (5) A ratio of production in the reporting year to production in the
 previous year. The ratio should be calculated to most closely reflect all activ
ities involving the toxic chemical. In specific industrial classifications subje
ct to this section, where a feedstock or some variable other than production is 
the primary influence on waste characteristics or volumes, the report may provid
e an index based on that primary variable for each toxic chemical. The Administr
ator is encouraged to develop production indexes to accommodate individual indus
tries for use on a voluntary basis.
 (6) The techniques which were used to identify source reduction oppo
rtunities. Techniques listed should include, but are not limited to, employee re

TITLE IX--TRANSPORTATION
Subtitle A--Surface Transportation
SEC. 9001. SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT HIGHWAY USER TAXES SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO T
HE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
 (1) highway motor fuel taxes have in the past been dedicated to the 
Highway Trust Fund and used for the development of the surface transportation sy
stem;
 (2) extraordinary budget pressures have led to consideration of the 
need for a temporary, 5-year highway motor fuels tax for deficit reduction;

 (3) any portion of the new taxes deposited into the Highway Trust Fu
nd shall be available to accommodate our country's vital transportation needs;
 (4) adequate funding of transportation is a key component of a natio
nal strategy for economic growth; and
 (5) use of the highway motor fuels taxes for deficit reduction shoul
d be temporary so that we can return as soon as possible to the dedicated user f
ee principle in order to ensure fairness to highway users and to ensure that nee
ded transportation infrastructure improvements are made.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) any increase in motor fuel excise taxes that are deposited in th
e Highway Trust Fund shall be available for surface transportation purposes;
 (2) the Budget Resolutions for fiscal years 1991 through 1995 should
 accommodate the Nation's transportation needs and the section 302(a) allocation
s should provide budget authority and outlays attributable to the increase in de
posits into the Highway Trust Fund as a result of any increases in motor fuels t
axes through implementation of this Act;
 (3) Congress reaffirms the principle that highway motor fuel taxes s
hould be deposited in the Highway Trust Fund; and
 (4) to the extent the highway motor fuel taxes are used for deficit 
reduction during the 5-year period beginning with fiscal year 1991, the Congress
 should return to the dedicated user fee principle as soon as possible but no la
ter than the end of fiscal year 1995.

ract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation;

Subtitle D--Aviation Noise Policy
SEC. 9301. SHORT TITLE.
 This subtitle may be cited as the `Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 199
0'.
SEC. 9302. FINDINGS.
 The Congress finds that--
 (1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase i
n airport capacity;
 (2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsist
ent restrictions on aviation which could impede the national air transportation 
system;
 (3) a noise policy must be implemented at the national level;
 (4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered 
in determining the national interest;
 (5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new tech
nology aircraft, combined with the use of revenues, including those available fr
om passenger facility charges, for noise management;
 (6) federally controlled revenues can help resolve noise problems an
d carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;
 (7) revenues derived from a passenger facility charge may be applied
 to noise management and increased airport capacity; and
 (8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of passenger 
facility charges is the issuance by the Secretary of Transportation of a final r
ule establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions 
on operations of Stage 2 and Stage 3 aircraft.
SEC. 9303. NATIONAL AVIATION NOISE POLICY.
 (a) DEVELOPMENT- Not later than July 1, 1991, the Secretary of Transport
ation (hereinafter in this subtitle referred to as the `Secretary') shall issue 
regulations establishing a national aviation noise policy which takes into accou
nt the findings, determinations, and provisions of this subtitle, including the 
phaseout and nonaddition of Stage 2 aircraft as provided in this subtitle and im
plementation dates and reporting requirements consistent with this subtitle and 
existing law.
 (b) BASIS- The national aviation noise policy shall be based upon a deta
iled economic analysis of the impact of the phaseout date for Stage 2 aircraft o
n competition in the airline industry, including the ability of air carriers to 
achieve capacity growth consistent with the projected rate of growth for the air
line industry, the impact of competition within the airline and aircargo industr
ies, the impact on nonhub and small community air service, and the impact on new
 entry into the airline industry.
 (c) RECOMMENDATIONS- Not later than July 1, 1991, the Secretary shall tr
ansmit to Congress recommendations on--
 (1) the need for changes in the standards and procedures which gover
n the rights of State and local governments (including airport authorities) to r
estrict aircraft operations for the purpose of limiting aircraft noise;
 (2) the need for changes in the standards and procedures which gover
n law suits by persons adversely affected by aircraft noise;
 (3) the need for changes in standards and procedures for Federal reg
ulation of airspace (including the pattern of operations for the air traffic con
trol system) in order to take better account of environmental effects;
 (4) the need for changes in the Federal program providing assistance
 for noise abatement planning and programs, including the need for greater incen
tives or mandatory requirements for local restrictions on the use of land impact
ed by aircraft noise;
 (5) whether any changes in policy recommended in paragraphs (1) thro
ugh (4) should be accomplished through regulatory, administrative, or legislativ
e action; and
 (6) specific legislative proposals necessary for implementing the na
tional aviation noise policy.
SEC. 9304. NOISE AND ACCESS RESTRICTION REVIEWS.

`SEC. 251. ENFORCING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.
 `(a) FISCAL YEARS 1991-1995 Enforcement-
 `(1) SEQUESTRATION- Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns 
to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 2
52 and section 253, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year br
each, if any, within any category.
 `(2) ELIMINATING A BREACH- Each non-exempt account within a category
 shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline leve
l of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the unifor
m percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category; except that t
he health programs set forth in section 256(e) shall not be reduced by more than
 2 percent and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this p
aragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to eliminate th
at breach. If, within a category, the discretionary spending limits for both new
 budget authority and outlays are breached, the uniform percentage shall be calc
ulated by--
 `(A) first, calculating the uniform percentage necessary to elim
inate the breach in new budget authority, and
 `(B) second, if any breach in outlays remains, increasing the un
iform percentage to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach.
 `(3) MILITARY PERSONNEL- If the President uses the authority to exem
pt any military personnel from sequestration under section 255(h), each account 
within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts 
for which the authority provided under section 255(h) has been exercised) shall 
be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted leve
l of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform 
percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not 
reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.
 `(4) PART-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS- If, on the date specified in paragrap
h (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of
 a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated 
for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from--
 `(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that ac
count under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and
 `(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted,
 from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation.
 `(5) LOOK-BACK- If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal y
ear in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year 
(after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), t
he discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shal
l be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.
 `(6) WITHIN-SESSION SEQUESTRATION- If an appropriation for a fiscal 
year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that
 budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within 
a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of a
mounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to el
iminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in p
aragraphs (2) through (4).
 `(7) OMB ESTIMATES- As soon as practicable after Congress completes 
action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Comm
ittees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provi
de OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and 
outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legis
lation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any discretionary appropri
ation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Se
nate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amo
unt of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if a
ny) and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any 
difference between the two estimates. For purposes of this paragraph, amounts pr
ovided by annual appropriations shall include any new budget authority and outla
ys for those years in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation
 that result from previously enacted legislation. Those OMB estimates shall be m
ade using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB esti
mates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph for the purposes of this 
subsection. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conforma
nce with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House a
nd Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
 `(b) ADJUSTMENTS TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS- (1) When the Presiden
t submits the budget under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for 
budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall
 calculate (in the order set forth below), and the budget shall include, adjustm
ents to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted
) for the budget year and each outyear through 1995 to reflect the following:
 `(A) CHANGES IN CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS- The adjustments produced b
y the amendments made by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1990 or by any other changes in concepts and definitions shall equal the baselin
e levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and defin
itions minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before su
ch changes. Such other changes in concepts and definitions may only be made in c
onsultation with the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Government Operat
ions, and Governmental Affairs of the House of Representatives and Senate.<
/ul>
 `(B) CHANGES IN INFLATION- (i) For a budget submitted for budget yea
r 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, the adjustments produced by changes in inflation sh
all equal the levels of discretionary new budget authority and outlays in the ba
seline (calculated using current estimates) subtracted from those levels in that
 baseline recalculated with the baseline inflators for the budget year only, mul
tiplied by the inflation adjustment factor computed under clause (ii).
 `(ii) For a budget year the inflation adjustment factor shall equal 
the ratio between the level of year-over-year inflation measured for the fiscal 
year most recently completed and the applicable estimated level for that year se
t forth below:
 `For 1990, 1.041
 `For 1991, 1.052
 `For 1992, 1.041
 `For 1993, 1.033
Inflation shall be measured by the average of the estimated gross nat
ional product implicit price deflator index for a fiscal year divided by the ave
rage index for the prior fiscal year.
 `(C) CREDIT REESTIMATES- For a budget submitted for fiscal year 1993
 or 1994, the adjustments produced by reestimates to costs of Federal credit pro
grams shall be, for any such program, a current estimate of new budget authority
 and outlays associated with a baseline projection of the prior year's gross loa
n level for that program minus the baseline projection of the prior year's new b
udget authority and associated outlays for that program.
 `(2) When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 254(g) or (h)
 for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 (except as otherwise indicated)
, OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the sequestration repo
rt, and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of t
itle 31, United States Code, shall include, adjustments to discretionary spendin
g limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding 
year through 1995, as follows:
 `(A) IRS FUNDING- To the extent that appropriations are enacted that
 provide additional new budget authority or result in additional outlays (as com
pared with the CBO baseline constructed in June 1990) for the Internal Revenue S
ervice compliance initiative in any fiscal year, the adjustments for that year s
hall be those amounts, but shall not exceed the amounts set forth below--
 `(i) for fiscal year 1991, $191,000,000 in new budget authority 
and $183,000,000 in outlays;
 `(ii) for fiscal year 1992, $172,000,000 in new budget authority
 and $169,000,000 in outlays;
 `(iii) for fiscal year 1993, $183,000,000 in new budget authorit
y and $179,000,000 in outlays;
 `(iv) for fiscal year 1994, $187,000,000 in new budget authority
 and $183,000,000 in outlays; and
 `(v) for fiscal year 1995, $188,000,000 in new budget authority 
and $184,000,000 in outlays; and
the prior-year outlays resulting from these appropriations of budget 
authority.
 `(B) DEBT FORGIVENESS- If, in calendar year 1990 or 1991, an appropr
iation is enacted that forgives the Arab Republic of Egypt's foreign military sa
les indebtedness to the United States and any part of the Government of Poland's
 indebtedness to the United States, the adjustment shall be the estimated costs 
(in new budget authority and outlays, in all years) of that forgiveness.
 `(C) IMF FUNDING- If, in fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995
 an appropriation is enacted to provide to the International Monetary Fund the d
ollar equivalent, in terms of Special Drawing Rights, of the increase in the Uni
ted States quota as part of the International Monetary Fund Ninth General Review
 of Quotas, the adjustment shall be the amount provided by that appropriation.
 `(D) EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS- (i) If, for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1
993, 1994, or 1995, appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that t
he President designates as emergency requirements and that the Congress so desig
nates in statute, the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in di
scretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowin
g in all years from such appropriations.
 `(ii) The costs for operation Desert Shield are to be treated as eme
rgency funding requirements not subject to the defense spending limits. Funding 
for Desert Shield will be provided through the normal legislative process. Deser
t Shield costs should be accommodated through Allied burden-sharing, subsequent 
appropriation Acts, and if the President so chooses, through offsets within othe
r defense accounts. Emergency Desert Shield costs mean those incremental costs a
ssociated with the increase in operations in the Middle East and do not include 
costs that would be experienced by the Department of Defense as part of its norm
al operations absent Operation Desert Shield.
 `(E) SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FOR DISCRETIONARY NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY- (i) F
or each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the domestic category 
in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.1 percent of the sum of the adjusted 
discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fis
cal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated 
therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the domestic category);
 `(ii) for each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the
 international category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.079 percent o
f the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority 
for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), togethe
r with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for
 the international category); and
 `(iii) if, for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the amount of new budget 
authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limi
t on new budget authority for any category due to technical estimates made by th
e Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount 
of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for 1992 and 1993 together) equal to
 0.042 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary limits on new budget aut
hority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively).<
/ul>
 `(F) SPECIAL OUTLAY ALLOWANCE- If in any fiscal year outlays for a c
ategory exceed the discretionary spending limit for that category but new budget
 authority does not exceed its limit for that category (after application of the
 first step of a sequestration described in subsection (a)(2), if necessary), th
e adjustment in outlays is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed $2,500,00
0,000 in the defense category, $1,500,000,000 in the international category, or 
$2,500,000,000 in the domestic category (as applicable) in fiscal year 1991, 199
2, or 1993, and not to exceed $6,500,000,000 in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 less an
y of the outlay adjustments made under subparagraph (E) for a category for a fis
cal year.
`SEC. 252. ENFORCING PAY-AS-YOU-GO.
 `(a) FISCAL YEARS 1992-1995 ENFORCEMENT- The purpose of this section is 
to assure that any legislation (enacted after the date of enactment of this sect
ion) affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit in any fis
cal year covered by this Act will trigger an offsetting sequestration.
 `(b) SEQUESTRATION; LOOK-BACK- Within 15 calendar days after Congress ad
journs to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on th
e same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 251 and section 253, there 
shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase in tha
t fiscal year and the prior fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receip
ts legislation enacted after the date of enactment of this section (after adjust
ing for any prior sequestration as provided by paragraph (2)). OMB shall calcula
te the amount of deficit increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding--
 `(1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and receipts legisl
ation transmitted under subsection (d) applicable to those fiscal years, other t
han any amounts included in such estimates resulting from--
 `(A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance
 guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of this section, and
 `(B) emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e); an
d
 `(2) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs app
licable to those fiscal years resulting from the prior year's sequestration unde
r this section or section 253, if any (except for any amounts sequestered as a r
esult of a net deficit increase in the fiscal year immediately preceding the pri
or fiscal year), as published in OMB's end-of-session sequestration report for t
hat prior year.
 `(c) ELIMINATING A DEFICIT INCREASE- (1) The amount required to be seque
stered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) shall be obtained from non-exempt d
irect spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:
 `(A) FIRST- All reductions in automatic spending increases specified
 in section 256(a) shall be made.
 `(B) SECOND- If additional reductions in direct spending accounts ar
e required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 256(b) 
(guaranteed student loans) and 256(c) (foster care and adoption assistance) shal
l be made.
 `(C) THIRD- (i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts
 are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shal
l be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direc
t spending required by paragraph (1); except that the medicare programs specifie
d in section 256(d) shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform 
percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph
 shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required
 reduction in direct spending.
 `(ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outla
y reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commo
dity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would o
ccur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the 
fiscal year of the sequestration.
 `(2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at
 the level in the baseline.
 `(d) OMB ESTIMATES- As soon as practicable after Congress completes acti
on on any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after the date of enac
tment of this section, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of t
he House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estima
te of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each f
iscal year through fiscal year 1995 resulting from that legislation. Within 5 ca
lendar days after the enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation e
nacted after the date of enactment of this section, OMB shall transmit a report 
to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate o
f that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receip
ts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1995 resulting f
rom that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estim
ates. Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical ass
umptions. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformanc
e with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and
 Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
 `(e) EMERGENCY LEGISLATION- If, for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 
or 1995, a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that 
the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so de
signates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts 
in all fiscal years through 1995 resulting from that provision shall be designat
ed as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d).
`SEC. 253. ENFORCING DEFICIT TARGETS.
 `(a) SEQUESTRATION- Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to e
nd a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day 
as a sequestration (if any) under section 251 and section 252, but after any seq
uestration required by section 251 (enforcing discretionary spending limits) or 
section 252 (enforcing pay-as-you-go), there shall be a sequestration to elimina
te the excess deficit (if any remains) if it exceeds the margin.
 `(b) EXCESS DEFICIT; MARGIN- The excess deficit is, if greater than zero
, the estimated deficit for the budget year, minus--
 `(1) the maximum deficit amount for that year;
 `(2) the amounts for that year designated as emergency direct spendi
ng or receipts legislation under section 252(e); and
 `(3) for any fiscal year in which there is not a full adjustment for
 technical and economic reestimates, the deposit insurance reestimate for that y
ear, if any, calculated under subsection (h).
The `margin' for fiscal year 1992 or 1993 is zero and for fiscal year 199
4 or 1995 is $15,000,000,000.
 `(c) DIVIDING THE SEQUESTRATION- To eliminate the excess deficit in a bu
dget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exe
mpt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President's fis
cal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts 
(all other non-exempt accounts).
 `(d) DEFENSE- Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a doll
ar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary resource
s in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out 
subsection (c), except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments s
hall be made under the procedure set forth in section 251(a)(3).
 `(e) NON-DEFENSE- Actions to reduce non-defense accounts shall be taken 
in the following order:
 `(1) FIRST- All reductions in automatic spending increases under sec
tion 256(a) shall be made.
 `(2) SECOND- If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are re
quired to be made, the maximum reduction permissible under sections 256(b) (guar
anteed student loans) and 256(c) (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be 
made.
 `(3) THIRD- (A) If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are
 required to be made, each remaining non-exempt, non-defense account shall be re
duced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in non-defense 
outlays required by subsection (c), except that--
 `(i) the medicare program specified in section 256(d) shall not 
be reduced by more than 2 percent in total including any reduction of less than 
2 percent made under section 252 or, if it has been reduced by 2 percent or more
 under section 252, it may not be further reduced under this section; and
 `(ii) the health programs set forth in section 256(e) shall not 
be reduced by more than 2 percent in total (including any reduction made under s
ection 251),
and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this s
ubsection shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the
 required reduction in non-defense outlays.
 `(B) For purposes of determining reductions under subparagraph (A), 
outlay reduction (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation c
ommodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that wou
ld occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in 
the fiscal year of the sequestration.
 `(f) BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS; PART-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS-
 `(1) BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS- For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), 
and (e), accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any 
reductions required to be made under sections 251 and 252.
 `(2) PART-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS- If, on the date specified in subsecti
on (a), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part o
f a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration
 calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e), as applicable, shall b
e subtracted from--
 `(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that ac
count under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and
 `(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted,
 from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation; except that 
the amount to be sequestered from that account shall be reduced (but not below z
ero) by the savings achieved by that appropriation when the enacted amount is le
ss than the baseline for that account.
 `(g) ADJUSTMENTS TO MAXIMUM DEFICIT AMOUNTS-
 `(1) ADJUSTMENTS-
 `(A) When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992,
 the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall b
e adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptio
ns and any changes in concepts or definitions. When the President submits the bu
dget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 19
94, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of econ
omic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.<
/ul>
 `(B) When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the Presid
ent may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1
995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions. If 
the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the f
iscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment p
rocedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the Pres
ident must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described 
in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then th
ose procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections
 251(b)(1)(C) and 251(b)(2)(E), otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or
 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1
995 if applicable).
 `(C) When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted a
nd the sequestration reports for those years under section 254 are made (as appl
icable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in s
ubparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjust
ed by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applic
able for that year (if any) under section 251(b).
 `(D) For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made wi
th the submission of the President's budget for that year shall also be made whe
n OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report
 for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumpt
ions in the President's budget for that year.
Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum
 deficit amounts set forth in section 601 of the Congressional Budget Act of 197
4.
 `(2) CALCULATIONS OF ADJUSTMENTS- The required increase or decrease 
shall be calculated as follows:
 `(A) The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using u
p-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and defi
nitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, us
ing the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 601 of the Congressio
nal Budget Act of 1974 as adjusted under section 251.
 `(B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct s
pending and receipts legislation enacted after the date of enactment of this sec
tion (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall b

n of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the sur
plus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted thro
ugh the applicable date.
 `(b) DIRECT SPENDING AND RECEIPTS- For the budget year and each outyear,
 the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:
 `(1) IN GENERAL- Laws providing or creating direct spending and rece
ipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such 
year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all
 payments required by those laws.
 `(2) EXCEPTIONS- (A) No program with estimated current-year outlays 
greater than $50 million shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or outyea
rs.
 `(B) The increase for veterans' compensation for a fiscal year is as
sumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans' pensions unless other
wise provided by law enacted in that session.
 `(C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assume
d to be extended at current rates.
 `(3) HOSPITAL INSURANCE TRUST FUND- Notwithstanding any other provis
ion of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund 
shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.
 `(c) DISCRETIONARY APPROPRIATIONS- For the budget year and each outyear,
 the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all 
amounts other than those covered by subsection (b):
 `(1) INFLATION OF CURRENT-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS- Budgetary resources o
ther than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget yea
r in full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a full-year appropriation 
has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances sh
all be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cum
ulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for soci
al insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pa
y absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflat
ion as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in
 the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.
 `(2) EXPIRING HOUSING CONTRACTS- New budget authority to renew expir
ing multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the diff
erence in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fisc
al year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renew
al cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.
 `(3) SOCIAL INSURANCE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES- Budgetary resources f
or the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by
 the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to th
at fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Med
ical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirem
ent account.
 `(4) PAY ANNUALIZATION; OFFSET TO PAY ABSORPTION- Current-year new b
udget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-m
onth costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fisc
al year.
 `(5) INFLATORS- The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgeta
ry resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, privat
e industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current
 year. The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resource
s shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross national prod
uct fixed-weight price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of su
ch estimated index for the current year.
 `(6) CURRENT-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS- If, for any account, a continuing 
appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the curre
nt-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if t
hat continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the 
transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the curr
ent-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submis
sion of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's original budget for
 the budget year.
 `(d) UP-TO-DATE CONCEPTS- In deriving the baseline for any budget year o
r outyear, current-year amounts shall be calculated using the concepts and defin
itions that are required for that budget year.'.
