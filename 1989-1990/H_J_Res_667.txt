Joint Resolution
To designate November 16, 1990, as `National Federation of the Blind Day'.
Whereas the National Federation of the Blind was established in Wilkes Barre,
Pennsylvania, on November 16, 1940;
Whereas the Federation is the largest organization for blind people in the
United States;
Whereas the Federation was founded to provide a sense of security, equality,
and opportunity, and an outlet for self-expression for the blind;
Whereas the Federation has over 50,000 members, national chapters in every
State and the District of Columbia, and local chapters in almost every
community;
Whereas the founders of the Federation, who are themselves blind, have
been instrumental in instilling hope and self-assurance in the blind and in
improving the public image of blind people;
Whereas programs conducted by the Federation assist the blind in obtaining
and performing jobs and becoming productive members of society; and
Whereas the many functions, activities, and programs of the Federation have
provided significant benefits to the blind and to the Nation: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 16, 1990, is designated as
 `National Federation of the Blind Day', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
