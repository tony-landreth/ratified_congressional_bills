 sent a notice in an appropriate form by not later than January 31, 1990,
 that explains--
 `(A) the changes in benefits under this title effected by the Medicare
 Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989, and

 who had in effect, as of December 31, 1988, a medicare supplemental policy
 with an insurer (as a policyholder or, in the case of a group policy, as
 a certificate holder) and the individual terminated coverage under such
 policy before the date of the enactment of this subsection, no medicare
 supplemental policy of the insurer shall be deemed to meet the standards
 in subsection (c) unless the insurer--
 `(i) provides written notice, no earlier than December 15, 1989, and no
 later than January 30, 1990, to the policyholder or certificate holder (at
 the most recent available address) of the offer described in clause (ii), and

 effective as of January 1, 1990), under the terms which (I) do not provide
 for any waiting period with respect to treatment of pre-existing conditions,
 (II) provides for coverage which is substantially equivalent to coverage
 in effect before the date of such termination, and (III) provides for
 classification of premiums on which terms are at least as favorable to
 the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms
 that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the
 coverage never terminated.
 `(B) An insurer is not required to make the offer under subparagraph (A)(ii)
 in the case of an individual who is a policyholder or certificate holder
 in another medicare supplemental policy as of the date of the enactment of
