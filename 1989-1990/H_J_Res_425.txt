AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating Nvember 12 through 18, 1989, as `Community Foundation Week'.
Whereas the citizens of the United States have a strong tradition of
contributing generously to the well-being of their communities and the Nation;
Whereas community foundations are tax-exempt organizations formed to attract
endowment funds and to distribute foundation earnings to further the well-being
of their communities;
Whereas these earnings are distributed by volunteer boards of directors who
are knowledgeable of their communities' needs in areas such as education, arts
and culture, social services, economic development, health, the environment,
and civic affairs;
Whereas community foundations augment the effectiveness of public and other
private services by providing essential coordination to these efforts,
and address community needs by providing leadership and resources on a
permanent basis;
Whereas community foundations are in their 75th year of existence in the
United States, and are the fastest growing form of philanthropy today;
Whereas there are now more than 300 community foundations in the United
States with total assets of over $4,750,000,000; and
Whereas the Nation's citizens who generously support philanthropic and
charitable organizations should be highly commended and encouraged to increase
and perpetuate private voluntary contributions to community foundations:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week of November 12 through 18,
 1989, is designated as `Community Foundation Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
