 Defense and National Security.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 The Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Recent revolutionary world events require a fundamental reassessment
 of the defense and national security policies of the United States.
 (2) Emerging democracies around the world will require political, technical,
 and economic assistance, as well as military assistance, from the developed
 free nations in order to thrive and to become productive members of the
 world community.
 (3) Real and potential military threats to the United States and its allies
 will continue to exist for the foreseeable future from not just the Soviet
 Union but also from terrorism and from Third World nations.
 (4) Proliferation of both sophisticated conventional weapons and of nuclear
 weapons could produce a world more dangerous than we have faced in the past.
 (5) Ethnic rivalries as well as economic inequalities may produce
 instabilities that could spark serious conflict.
 (6) In order to formulate coherent national policies to meet these challenges
 of a new world environment, it is essential for the United States to achieve
 a bipartisan consensus such as that which emerged following World War II.
 (7) Such a consensus can be fostered by the development of policy
 recommendations from a highly respected group of individuals who do not
 bear a partisan label and who possess critical expertise and experience.

 include the full range of appropriate law enforcement and anti-drug abuse

 SEC. 8136. (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) the President and Secretary of State have stated publicly that a new
 international order is being created;
 (2) such order is characterized, among other things, by--
 (A) a rough parity of financial and technological strength and of standards
 of living among Members of the Group of Seven;
 (B) the successful culmination of allied postwar foreign policy in the
 emergence of political and economic freedom in formerly communist nations
 and the progressive integration of such nations into the world economy; and
 (C) with the reduction of ideological and military tension between members
 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, the increased
 importance of economic strength in the ability of nations to provide for
 national security and promote foreign policy objectives;
 (3) such rough parity of economic strength among Members of the Group of Seven
 as well as the large and growing net national and international debt of the
 United States affirm that the new international order should be accompanied
 by a more balanced distribution of the economic burden of providing for common
 security than that which accompanied the postwar international order; and
 (4) it should be a priority of United States foreign policy in the new
 international order to attain at an early stage a more balanced distribution
 of the aggregate economic burden of common security among advanced industrial
 nations.
 (b) NEGOTIATIONS- It is the sense of the Congress that the President should
 negotiate within the Group of Seven to conclude agreements providing for--
 (1) a commonly accepted methodology by which to measure relative rates of
 expenditures on common security objectives by each Member;
 (2) through the application of such methodology, commonly accepted
 calculations of current rates of expenditures on common security objectives
 by each Member; and
 (3) a framework, concrete agenda, and timetable of actions by each Member
 to converge substantially their aggregate rates of expenditures on common
 security objectives as a proportion of national income over a reasonable,
 finite period.
 (c) REPORTS TO CONGRESS- It is the sense of the Congress that the President
 should submit reports to Congress no later than August 1, 1991, and August
 1, 1992, assessing progress toward the agreements referred to in subsection
 (b). In the absence of substantial progress toward the agreements referred
 to in subsection (b) at the time of issuance of such reports, the President
 should include in such reports a calculation and comparative analysis of
 current rates of expenditures on common security objectives by each Member
 on the basis of the best and most current information available.
 (d) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this section--
 (1) the term `Members' means the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada,
 the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United States, and the European
 Community; and

 country markets;
