One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate February 8, 1990, as `National Women and Girls in Sports Day'.
Whereas women's athletics is one of the most effective avenues available
through which women of America may develop self-discipline, initiative,
confidence, and leadership skills;
Whereas sport and fitness activity contributes to emotional and physical
well-being and women need strong bodies as well as strong minds;
Whereas the history of women in sports is rich and long, but there has
been little national recognition of the significance of women's athletic
achievements;
Whereas the number of women in leadership positions of coaches, officials,
and administrators has declined drastically over the last decade and there
is a need to restore women to these positions to ensure a fair representation
of women's abilities and to provide role models for young female athletes;
Whereas the bonds built between women through athletics help to break down
the social barriers of racism and prejudice;
Whereas the communication and cooperation skills learned through athletic
experience play a key role in the athlete's contributions at home, at work,
and to society;
Whereas women's athletics has produced such winners as Flo Hyman, whose spirit,
talent, and accomplishments distinguished her above others and exhibited
for all of us the true meaning of fairness, determination, and team play;
Whereas parents feel that sports are equally important for boys and girls
and that sports and fitness activities provide important benefits to girls
who participate;
Whereas early motor-skill training and enjoyable experiences of physical
activity strongly influence life-long habits of physical fitness;
Whereas the performances of such female athletes as Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
Florence Griffith Joyner, Bonnie Blair, Janet Evans, the United States
Women's Basketball Team and many others in the 1988 Olympic Games were a
source of inspiration and pride to all of us;
Whereas the athletic opportunities for male students at the collegiate and high
school level remain significantly greater than those for female students; and
Whereas the number of funded research projects focusing on the specific needs
of women athletes is limited and the information provided by these projects
is imperative to the health and performance of future women athletes: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That February 8, 1990, is hereby designated as
 `National Women and Girls in Sports Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon local and State jurisdictions,
 appropriate Federal agencies, and the people of the United States to observe
 the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
