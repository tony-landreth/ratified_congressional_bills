One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating the week of October 22 through October 28, 1990, as `Eating
Disorders
Awareness Week'.
Whereas anorexia nervosa (also known as starvation sickness) and bulimia
(also known as binge-purge syndrome) are emotional disorders that can lead
to serious physical illness and even death;
Whereas experts estimate that 1 out of every 100 women between the ages of
12 and 25 suffers from anorexia nervosa, that 1 out of every 7 women in that
age group develops bulimia, and that nearly 10 percent of all patients who
are referred to eating disorder clinics are men;
Whereas there has been a dramatic increase in the number of reported cases of
anorexia nervosa and bulimia, making the need to provide effective treatment
to the victims of these disorders much larger than in the past; and
Whereas public awareness about the personal and familial tragedies caused
by anorexia nervosa and bulimia must be raised in order to promote continued
research into the causes and treatments of these and other eating disorders:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 22 through October
 28, 1990, is designated as `Eating Disorders Awareness Week'. The President
 is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe that week with appropriate programs and
 activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
