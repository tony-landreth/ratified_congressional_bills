One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate March 25, 1989, as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of
Celebration of Greek and American Democracy'.
Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the
supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States of America drew heavily
upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming
our representative democracy;
Whereas March 25, 1989, marks the one hundred and sixty-eighth anniversary
of the beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from the
Ottoman Empire;
Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond between our two
nations and their peoples; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Greek people, and to
reaffirm the democratic principles from which our two great nations sprang:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1989, is designated as
 `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American
 Democracy', and that the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe the designated day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
