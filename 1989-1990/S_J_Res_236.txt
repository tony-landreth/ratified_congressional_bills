Joint Resolution
Designating May 6 through 12, 1990, as `Be Kind to Animals and National
Pet Week'.
Whereas 1990 marks the 75th anniversary of the American Humane Association's
`Be Kind to Animals Week' and the 10th anniversary of `National Pet Week',

Whereas animals and pets give companionship and pleasure in daily living,
share the homes of nearly 50,000,000 individuals or families in the United
States, and provide special benefits to elderly persons and children;
Whereas the people of the United States have a firm commitment to promote
responsible care of animals and pets and guard against cruel and irresponsible
treatment;
Whereas teaching kindness and respect for all living animals through education
in schools and communities is essential to the basic values of a humane and
civilized society;
Whereas the people of the United States are grateful to the veterinary
medical profession for providing preventive and emergency medical care and
assistance to animals, spaying and neutering animals to combat overpopulation,
and contributing to the education of animal owners; and
Whereas the people of the United States are indebted to animal protection
organizations, State humane organizations, and local animal care and control
agencies for promoting respect for animals and pets, educating children about
humane attitudes, and caring for lost, unwanted, abused, and abandoned animals:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That May 6 through 12, 1990, is designated as
