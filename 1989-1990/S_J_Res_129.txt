AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To provide for the designation of September 15, 1989, as `National POW/MIA
Recognition Day'.
Whereas the United States has fought in many wars;
Whereas thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by
the enemy or listed as missing in action;
Whereas many American prisoners of war were subjected to brutal and inhuman
treatment by their enemy captors in violation of international codes and
customs for the treatment of prisoners of war, and many such prisoners of
war died from such treatment;
Whereas many of these Americans are still missing and unaccounted for, and
the uncertainty surrounding their fates has caused their families to suffer
acute hardship; and
Whereas the sacrifices of Americans still missing and unaccounted for
and their families are deserving of national recognition and support for
continued priority efforts to determine the fate of those missing Americans:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That September 15, 1989, is hereby designated
 as `National POW/MIA Recognition Day'. The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to recognize that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
