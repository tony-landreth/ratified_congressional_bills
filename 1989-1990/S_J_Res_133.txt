S.J.Res.133
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating October 1989 as `National Domestic Violence Awareness Month'.
Whereas it is estimated that a woman is battered every fifteen seconds
in America;
Whereas domestic violence is the single largest cause of injury to women in
the United States, affecting three million to four million women;
Whereas urban and rural women of all racial, social, religious, ethnic,
and economic groups, and of all ages, physical abilities, and lifestyles
are affected by domestic violence;
Whereas 30 per centum of female homicide victims in 1986 were killed by
their husbands or boyfriends;
Whereas one-third of the domestic violence incidents involve felonies,
specifically, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault;
Whereas in 50 per centum of families where the wife is being abused, the
children of that family are also abused;
Whereas some individuals in our law enforcement and judicial systems continue
to think of spousal abuse as a `private' matter and are hesitant to intervene
and treat domestic assault as a crime;
Whereas in 1986, over three hundred and eleven thousand women, plus their
children, were provided emergency shelter in domestic violence shelters
and safehomes and the number of women and children that were sheltered by
domestic violence programs increased by nearly one hundred thousand between
1983 and 1986;
Whereas for every one woman sheltered nationwide, two women in need of
shelter may be turned away due to a lack of shelter space;
Whereas the nationwide efforts to help the victims of domestic violence need
to be coordinated;
Whereas there is a need to increase the public awareness and understanding
of domestic violence and the needs of battered women and their children; and
Whereas the dedication and successes of those working to end domestic violence
and the strength of the survivors of domestic violence should be recognized:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1989 is designated as `National
 Domestic Violence Awareness Month'. The President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe
 this month by becoming more aware of the tragedy of domestic violence,
 supporting those who are working to end domestic violence, and participating
 in other appropriate efforts.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
