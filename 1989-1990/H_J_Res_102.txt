H.J.Res.102
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate April 1989 as `National Recycling Month'.
Whereas a solid waste disposal crisis exists in the United States;
Whereas half of the major cities in the United States will have no space
available for disposal of garbage within 4 years;
Whereas trash incineration and non-incineration industries should adopt
recycling methods;
Whereas source separation, mechanical separation, and community-based
recycling programs divert a significant portion of waste from landfills;
Whereas recycling preserves limited landfill capacity for disposal of
nontoxic waste;
Whereas recycling saves energy and avoids the pollution created in extracting
resources from their natural environment;
Whereas the revenues from goods recovered by public sector recycling programs
help to offset the costs of the programs;
Whereas shared savings, which accrue by avoiding the higher cost of landfills
or incineration, make recycling an economically efficient disposal policy
even where markets for recycled materials are weak or undeveloped;
Whereas a well-developed system of recycling scrap metals, paper, and glass
already exists and significantly reduces the quantity of solid waste composed
of metal, paper, and glass;
Whereas substantial increases in the amount of materials recycled will
require development of markets that absorb the increase in the amount of
materials recycled, known as incremental markets;
Whereas many consumer products are designed without sufficient regard for
safe and efficient recycling after disposal;
Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments should enact
legislative measures that will increase the amount of solid waste that
is recycled;
Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments should
encourage the growth of incremental markets for materials recovered from
recyclable goods;
Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments should promote
the design of products that can be recycled safely and efficiently after use;
Whereas the Federal Government and State and local governments should establish
requirements for in-home separation of waste to enable efficient recycling; and
Whereas the people of the United States should be encouraged to participate in
educational and legislative endeavors that promote waste separation methods,
community-based recycling programs, and expanded utilization of recovered
materials: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That April 1989 is designated as `National
 Recycling Month', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
