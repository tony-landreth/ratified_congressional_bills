 carrying out the functions described in this subsection and subsection (c)
 and all other functions delegated by the Director relating to the recruitment

 individuals whose applications for service as a volunteer have been approved
 and who are awaiting an assignment with a specific project or program.
 `(C) The Director shall, at a minimum, designate one employee of the
 ACTION Agency in each region of the United States whose primary duties and
 responsibilities shall be to assist the Administrator in carrying out the
 functions described in this subsection and subsection (c).
 `(D) The Director shall assign or hire as necessary, such additional national,
 regional, and State personnel to carry out the functions described in
 this subsection and subsection (c) as may be necessary to ensure that such
 functions are carried out in a timely and effective manner. The Director
 shall give priority in the hiring of such additional personnel to individuals
 who have formerly served as volunteers under this part and to individuals
 who have specialized experience in the recruitment of volunteers.
 `(3) Volunteers shall be selected from among qualified individuals submitting
 an application for such service at such time, in such form, and containing
 such information as may be necessary to evaluate the suitability of each
 individual for such service and to determine, in accordance with paragraph
 (7), the most appropriate assignment for each such volunteer. The Director

 submitted by any interested individual to, and shall be accepted by, any
 office of the ACTION Agency.
