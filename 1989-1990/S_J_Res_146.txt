S.J.Res.146
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating the week of September 24, 1989, as `Religious Freedom Week'.
Whereas the principle of religious liberty was an essential part of the
founding of our Nation, and must be safeguarded with eternal vigilance by
all men and women of good will;
Whereas religious liberty has been endangered throughout history by bigotry
and indifference;
Whereas the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees
the inalienable rights of individuals to worship freely or not be religious,
as they choose, without interference from governmental or other agencies;
Whereas the Constitution of the United States ensures religious freedom to
all of the people of the United States;
Whereas at Touro Synagogue in 1790, President George Washington issued his
famous letter declaring `to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance';
Whereas the Touro Synagogue letter advocating the doctrine of mutual respect
and understanding was issued more than 1 year before the adoption of the
Bill of Rights;
Whereas the letter of President Washington and the Touro Synagogue have become
national symbols of the commitment of the United States to religious freedom;
Whereas throughout our Nation's history, religion has contributed to the
welfare of believers and of society generally, and has been a force for
maintaining high standards for morality, ethics, and justice;
Whereas religion is most free when it is observed voluntarily at private
initiative, uncontaminated by Government interference and unconstrained by
majority preference; and
Whereas religious liberty can be protected only through the efforts of all
persons of good will in a united commitment: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week of September 24, 1989,
 is hereby declared to be `Religious Freedom Week', wherein members of all
 faiths or none, may join together in support of religious tolerance and
 religious liberty for all.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
