H.J.Res.587
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Committing to the private sector the responsibility for support of the Civic
Achievement Award Program in Honor of the Office of Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and for other purposes.
Whereas the continuing strength and vitality of American democratic traditions
depend on the civic awareness of future generations;
Whereas numerous studies have documented the need to improve the level of
civic literacy of American young people;
Whereas students in the fifth grade through the eighth grade are at a critical
stage for development of values, character, and attitudes;
Whereas Congress established the Civic Achievement Award Program in Honor
of the Office of Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1987 to assist
in providing such students with a meaningful and relevant supplement to the
social studies curriculum;
Whereas the Program has helped students to master knowledge of American
history, geography, government, economics, culture, and current events,
and to develop library, research and critical thinking skills;
Whereas participating students have volunteered hundreds of thousands of
hours in civic action and community service activities since the inception
of the program;
Whereas the Close Up Foundation and the National Association of Elementary
School Principals are to be commended for the development and conduct of
the Program and for generating private sector support;
Whereas private sector support for the Program has enabled participation
to grow from 60,000 students to more than 400,000 students for the current
academic year and will ensure the continued success and expansion of the
Program in 1991 and beyond; and
Whereas private sector support will enable continuing and broadening
participation in the Program without continued assistance from the Congress:
Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
  America in Congress assembled, That the Joint Resolution entitled `Joint
  resolution providing support for the Civic Achievement Award Program in
  Honor of the Office of Speaker of the House of Representatives', approved
  November 9, 1987 (2 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), is repealed.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
