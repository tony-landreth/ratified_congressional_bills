H.J.Res.167
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate March 16, 1989, as `Freedom of Information Day'.
Whereas a fundamental principle of our Government is that a well-informed
citizenry can reach the important decisions that determine the present and
future of the Nation;
Whereas the freedoms we cherish as Americans are fostered by free access
to information;
Whereas many Americans, because they have never known any other way of life,
take for granted the guarantee of free access to information that derives
from the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas the guarantee of free access to information should be emphasized
and celebrated annually; and
Whereas March 16 is the anniversary of the birth of James Madison, one of
the Founding Fathers, who recognized and supported the need to guarantee
individual rights through the Bill of Rights: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 16, 1989, is designated as
 `Freedom of Information Day', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon Federal, State, and local government
 agencies and the people of the United States to observe such day with
 appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
