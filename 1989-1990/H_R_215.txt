An Act
To amend title 5, United States Code, with respect to the method by which
premium pay is determined for irregular, unscheduled overtime duty performed
by a Federal employee.
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That (a) section 5545(c)(2) of title 5,
 United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
 `(2) an employee in a position in which the hours of duty cannot be controlled
 administratively, and which requires substantial amounts of irregular,
 unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for
 recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require the employee to
 remain on duty, shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis
 instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter,
 except for regularly scheduled overtime, night, and Sunday duty, and for
 holiday duty. Premium pay under this paragraph is an appropriate percentage,
 not less than 10 percent nor more than 25 percent, of the rate of basic pay
 for the position, as determined by taking into consideration the frequency and
 duration of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty required in the position.'.
 (b) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to overtime
 duty performed on or after the first day of the first applicable pay period
 beginning after September 30, 1990.
