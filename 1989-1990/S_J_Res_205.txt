AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating December 3 through 9, 1989, as `National Cities Fight Back Against
Drugs Week'.
Whereas the presence of drugs and narcotics in our society has resulted in
innumerable problems of human, community, social, and economic dimensions;
Whereas the dissolution of the family, inadequate education system, poverty,
unemployment, and greed all contribute to illegal drug use;
Whereas the consequences of drug-related problems are witnessed in the loss
of human lives, the loss of economic productivity, and the diversion of
public resources to address these problems on all fronts;
Whereas the demand for illegal drugs is a pervasive problem that affects
all segments of our society, including professional and affluent people;
Whereas illegal drugs plague urban, suburban, and rural communities of all
sizes and regions;
Whereas illegal drugs constitute a problem in our community and lead to a
host of problems such as homicide, robbery, burglary, and other crimes and
domestic violence;
Whereas a national response is needed to curtail the importation, trafficking,
sale, and abuse of drugs;
Whereas our Nation's cities and towns carry the heaviest burden in confronting
the Nation's drug problem;
Whereas hundreds of America's dedicated public servants have died and thousands
of others risk their lives daily in our cities' individual battles against
illegal drugs and in the criminal activities stemming from illegal drugs; and
Whereas the National League of Cities has called on the President and the
Congress to join in a partnership in fighting drugs: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That December 3 through 9, 1989, is designated
 as `National Cities Fight Back Against Drugs Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
