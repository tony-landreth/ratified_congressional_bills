One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Relating to NASA and the International Space Year.
Whereas in 1985 Congress proposed an International Space Year (ISY) for 1992,
commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage to the New World and
the 35th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year that ushered in
the space age;
Whereas Congress also requested the President to endorse the ISY and to
initiate interagency and international discussions for an ISY;
Whereas in 1986 President Reagan endorsed the ISY and reported to Congress
that NASA had found worldwide support for an ISY in 1992, consisting of
space activities coordinated on a global basis, and the President directed
NASA to move the concept forward internationally and to lead an interagency
effort for domestic activities;
Whereas NASA has exercised admirable leadership, through the Office of
Space Science and Applications and the Division of International Relations,
in establishing the Space Agency Forum on ISY (SAFISY) to coordinate ISY
planning, with a current worldwide membership of 25 national space agencies
or equivalent bodies;
Whereas SAFISY planning is accelerating, with particular emphasis on
coordinating current and planned space agency activities so as to improve
efficiency and maximize scientific and economic return on space investments;
and
Whereas the ISY also is generating numerous educational activities, including
classroom activities, films, television programs, that will greatly improve
public understanding of the significance and potential of the space age:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of the Congress that
 the President should--
 (1) reaffirm support for the ISY and invite foreign leaders to do the same;
 (2) support the World Space Congress, to be convened in 1992, in its efforts
 to encourage cooperative space activities among nations in space science,
 space exploration, and the application of space technology;
 (3) invite the American public to develop ISY activities that foster the
 global perspective of the ISY;
 (4) direct NASA to continue to develop ISY activities through SAFISY,
 with a primary emphasis on Mission to Planet Earth, but also with a strong
 emphasis on the other space sciences, human exploration, education, and
 developing nations applications; and
 (5) report to Congress at the earliest practicable date, but no later than
 September 1, 1990, on the steps taken to carry out items (1) through (4)
 above, including a list of all current and planned NASA initiatives in each
 of the categories mentioned in item (4).
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
