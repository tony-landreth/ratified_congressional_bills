One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Smith-Lever Act of May 8,
1914, and its role in establishing our Nation's system of State Cooperative
Extension Services.
Whereas the Act of May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 372), as amended, commonly known as
the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, has fostered through the United States Department
of Agriculture the development of a system of State Cooperative Extension
Services in conjunction with our Nation's land-grant colleges and universities
which disseminates and encourages the application of research-generated
knowledge and leadership techniques to individuals, families and communities;
Whereas the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 has contributed greatly in assisting
American farm families with the efficient production of a reliable supply
of food and fiber for consumers in this country and worldwide;
Whereas the Cooperative Extension System has done much to help rural and
urban adults and youth help themselves as they have steadily improved their
quality of life and leadership ability; and
Whereas the relationship existing between the Federal, State and county
extension services has provided for citizen input to research and educational
programs of USDA and the land-grant universities for three quarters of a
century: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of the Congress that the
 Cooperative Extension System should continue to be supported as an important
 investment in the Nation's future, and that the seventy-fifth anniversary
 of the enactment of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 should be commemorated on
 May 8, 1989.
 SEC. 2. The President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 commemorating the enactment of the Smith-Lever Act of May 8, 1914, and its
 role in establishing our Nation's Cooperative Extension System.
