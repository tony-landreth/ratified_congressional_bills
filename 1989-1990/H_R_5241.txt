SEC. 101. ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO STATUTORY PAY RATES; LOCALITY-BASED
COMPARABILITY PAYMENTS; OTHER MATTERS.
 (a) GENERALLY- (1) Subchapter I of chapter 53 of title 5,  United States
 Code, is amended to read as follows:
`SUBCHAPTER I--PAY COMPARABILITY SYSTEM
`Sec. 5301. Policy
 `It is the policy of Congress that Federal pay fixing for employees under
 the General Schedule be based on the principles that--
 `(1) there be equal pay for substantially equal work within each local
 pay area;
 `(2) within each local pay area, pay distinctions be maintained in keeping
 with work and performance distinctions;
 `(3) Federal pay rates be comparable with non-Federal pay rates for the
 same levels of work within the same local pay area; and
 `(4) any existing pay disparities between Federal and non-Federal employees
 should be completely eliminated.
`Sec. 5302. Definitions
 `For the purpose of this subchapter--
 `(1) the term `statutory pay system' means a pay system under--
 `(A) subchapter III, relating to the General Schedule;
 `(B) section 403 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, relating to the Foreign
 Service of the  United States; or
 `(C) chapter 73 of title 38, relating to the Veterans Health Services and
 Research Administration;
 `(2) the term `ECI' means the Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries,
 private industry workers) published quarterly by the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics;
 `(3) the `base quarter' for any year is the 3-month period ending on
 September 30 of such year;
 `(4) the term `pay agent' means the agent designated by the President under
 section 5304(d)(1);
 `(5) the term `locality' or `pay locality' means any locality, as established
 or modified under section 5304;
 `(6) the term `pay disparity', as used with respect to a locality, means the
 extent to which rates of pay payable under the General Schedule are generally
 lower than the rates paid for the same levels of work by non-Federal workers
 in the same locality; except as otherwise required in this subchapter, a
 pay disparity shall be expressed as a single percentage which, if uniformly
 applied to employees within the locality who are receiving rates of pay under
 the General Schedule, would cause the rates payable to such employees to
 become substantially equal (when considered in the aggregate) to the rates
 paid to non-Federal workers for the same levels of work in the same locality;
 `(7) the term `comparability payment' means a payment payable under
 section 5304;
 `(8) the term `rates of pay under the General Schedule', `rates of pay for
 the General Schedule', or `scheduled rates of basic pay' means--
 `(A) the rates of basic pay set forth in the General Schedule; and
 `(B) in the case of an employee covered by the performance management and
 recognition system, the rates of basic pay under chapter 54; and
 `(9) the term `General Schedule position' means any position to which
 subchapter III applies (including any position under the performance
 management and recognition system).
`Sec. 5303. Annual adjustments to pay schedules
 `(a) Effective as of the first day of the first applicable pay period
 beginning on or after January 1 of each calendar year, the rates of basic pay
 for each statutory pay system shall be increased by the percentage (rounded
 to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) equal to one-half of 1 percentage
 point less than the percentage by which the ECI for the base quarter of
 the year before the preceding calendar year exceeds the ECI for the base
 quarter of the second year before the preceding calendar year (if at all).
 `(b)(1) If, because of national emergency or serious economic conditions
 affecting the general welfare, the President should consider the pay
 adjustment which would otherwise be required by subsection (a) in any year
 to be inappropriate, the President shall--
 `(A) prepare and transmit to Congress before September 1 of the preceding
 calendar year a plan for such alternative pay adjustments as he considers
 appropriate, together with the reasons therefor; and
 `(B) adjust the rates of pay of each statutory pay system, in accordance
 with such plan, effective on the same day as the increase under subsection
 (a) would otherwise take effect.
 `(2) In evaluating an economic condition affecting the general welfare under
 this subsection, the President shall consider pertinent economic measures
 including, but not limited to, the Indexes of Leading Economic Indicators,
 the Gross National Product, the unemployment rate, the budget deficit, the
 Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, the Employment Cost Index,
 and the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures.
 `(3) The President shall include in the report to Congress under paragraph
 (1)(A) his assessment of the impact that the alternative pay adjustments
 under this subsection will have on the Government's ability to recruit and
 retain well-qualified employees.
 `(c) The rates of basic pay that take effect under this section--
 `(1) shall modify, supersede, or render inapplicable, as the case may be,
 to the extent inconsistent therewith, any prior rates of basic pay under
 the statutory pay system involved (as last adjusted under this section or
 prior provisions of law); and
 `(2) shall be printed in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal
 Regulations.
 `(d) An increase in rates of basic pay that takes effect under this section
 is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of section 5335.
 `(e) This section does not impair any authority pursuant to which rates of
 basic pay may be fixed by administrative action.
 `(f) Pay may not be paid, by reason of any provision of this section
 (disregarding any comparability payment payable), at a rate in excess of
 the rate of basic pay payable for level V of the Executive Schedule.
 `(g) Any rate of pay under this section shall be initially adjusted, effective
 on the effective date of the rate of pay, under conversion rules prescribed
 by the President or by such agency or agencies as the President may designate.
`Sec. 5304. Locality-based comparability payments
 `(a) Pay disparities shall be identified and reduced as follows:
 `(1) Comparability payments shall be payable within each locality determined
 to have a pay disparity greater than 5 percent.
 `(2)(A) The localities having pay disparities, and the size of those
 disparities, shall, for purposes of any comparability payment scheduled
 to take effect in any calendar year, be determined in accordance with
 the appropriate report, as prepared and submitted to the President under
 subsection (d)(1) for purposes of such calendar year.
 `(B) Any computation necessary to determine the size of the comparability
 payment to become payable for any locality in a year (as well as any
 determination as to the size of any pay disparity remaining after that
 comparability payment is made) shall likewise be made using data contained
 in the appropriate report (described in subparagraph (A)) so prepared and
 submitted for purposes of such calendar year.
 `(3) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), the amount of the comparability
 payments payable under this subsection in a calendar year within any locality
 in which a comparative payment is payable shall be computed using such
 percentage as the President determines for such locality under subsection
 (d)(2), except that--
 `(A) the percentage for the first calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  1/5  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(B) the percentage for the second calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  3/10  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(C) the percentage for the third calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  2/5  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(D) the percentage for the fourth calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  1/2  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(E) the percentage for the fifth calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  3/5  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(F) the percentage for the sixth calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  7/10  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(G) the percentage for the seventh calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  4/5  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(H) the percentage for the eighth calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section may not be less than  9/10  of the amount needed
 to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;
 `(I) the percentage for the ninth calendar year in which any amounts are
 payable under this section, and any year thereafter, may not be less than the
 full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved
 to 5 percent;
 `(4) Nothing in this section shall be considered to preclude the President,
 in his discretion, from adjusting comparability payments to a level higher
 than the minimum level otherwise required in a calendar year, including to
 the level necessary to eliminate a locality's pay disparity completely.
 `(b) After the ninth calendar year (referred to in subsection (a)(3)(I)),
 the level of comparability payments payable within such locality may be
 reduced for any subsequent calendar year, but only if, or to the extent
 that, the reduction would not immediately create another pay disparity
 in excess of 5 percent within the locality (taking into consideration any
 comparability payments remaining payable).
 `(c)(1) The amount of the comparability payment payable within any particular
 locality during a calendar year--
 `(A) shall be stated as a single percentage, which shall be uniformly
 applicable to General Schedule positions within the locality; and
 `(B) shall, for any employee entitled to receive a comparability payment,
 be computed by applying that percentage to such employee's scheduled rate
 of basic pay (or, if lower due to a limitation on the rate payable, the
 rate actually payable), subject to subsection (g).
 `(2) A comparability payment--
 `(A) shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of retirement
 under chapter 83 or 84, as applicable, life insurance under chapter 87, and
 premium pay under subchapter V of chapter 55, and for such other purposes
 as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel
 Management may by regulation prescribe; and
 `(B) shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the basic
 pay payable to such employee pursuant to any provision of law outside of
 this section.
 `(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be considered to permit or require
 that any portion of a comparability payment be taken into account for
 purposes of any adjustment under section 5303.
 `(4)(A) Only employees receiving scheduled rates of basic pay (subject to
 any pay limitation which may apply) shall be eligible for comparability
 payments under this section.
 `(B) Comparability payments shall not be payable for service performed in
 any position which may not, under subsection (f)(1)(A), be included within
 a pay locality.
 `(d) In order to carry out this section, the President shall--
`(1) direct such agent as he considers appropriate to prepare and submit
to him annually, after considering such views and recommendations as may be
submitted under subsection (e) (but not later than 13 months before the start
of the calendar year for purposes of which it is prepared), a report that--
 `(A) compares the rates of pay under the General Schedule with the rates
 of pay generally paid to non-Federal workers for the same levels of work
 within each pay locality, as determined on the basis of appropriate annual
 surveys that shall be conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
 `(B) based on data from such surveys, identifies each locality in which a pay
 disparity exists and specifies the size of each such pay disparity (before
 and after taking into consideration any comparability payments payable);
 `(C) makes recommendations for appropriate comparability payments, in
 conformance with applicable requirements of this section; and
 `(D) includes the views and recommendations submitted under subsection (e);
 `(2) after considering the report of his agent (including the views and
 recommendations referred to in subsection (e)(2)(C), provide for or adjust
 comparability payments in conformance with applicable requirements of this
 section, effective as of the beginning of the first applicable pay period
 commencing on or after January 1 of the applicable year; and
 `(3) transmit to Congress a report of the actions taken under paragraph
 (2) (together with a copy of the report submitted to him by his agent,
 including the views and recommendations referred to in subsection (e)(2)(C))
 which shall--
 `(A) identify each pay locality;
 `(B) specify which localities have pay disparities in excess of 5 percent,
 and the size of the disparity existing in each of those localities, according
 to the pay agent's most recent report under paragraph (1) (before and after
 taking into consideration any comparability payments payable); and
 `(C) indicate the size of the respective comparability payments (expressed as
 percentages) which will be in effect under paragraph (2) for the various pay
 localities specified under subparagraph (B) for the applicable calendar year.
 `(e)(1) The President shall establish a Federal Salary Council of 9 members,
 of whom--
 `(A) 3 shall be chosen from among persons generally recognized for their
 impartiality, knowledge, and experience in the field of labor relations
 and pay policy; and
 `(B) 6 shall be representatives of employee organizations which represent
 substantial numbers of employees holding General Schedule positions,
 and who shall be selected giving due consideration to such factors as the
 relative numbers of employees represented by the various organizations,
 except that not more than 3 members of the Council at any one time shall
 be from a single employee organization, council, federation, alliance,
 association, or affiliation of employee organizations.
Members of the Council shall not receive pay by reason of their service
on the Council, nor shall members who are not otherwise employees of the
United States be considered employees by reason of any such service. The
President shall designate one of the members to serve as Chairman of the
Federal Salary Council. One of the 3 members under subparagraph (A) may be the
Chairman of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, notwithstanding
the restriction under section 5347(a)(1), and such individual may also be
designated to serve as Chairman of the Federal Salary Council.
 `(2) The pay agent shall--
 `(A) provide for meetings with the Council and give thorough consideration
 to the views and recommendations of the Council and the individual views
 and recommendations, if any, of the members of the Council regarding--
 `(i) the establishment or modification of pay localities;
 `(ii) the coverage of the annual survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics under subsection (d)(1)(A) (including, but not limited to,
 the occupations, establishment sizes, and industries, to be surveyed,
 and how pay localities are to be surveyed);
 `(iii) the process of comparing the rates of pay payable under the General
 Schedule with rates of pay for the same levels of work performed by
 non-Federal workers; and

 affecting the general welfare, the President should consider the level of
 comparability payments which would otherwise be payable under section 5304
 in any year to be inappropriate, the President shall--
 `(1) prepare and transmit to Congress, at least 1 month before those
 comparability payments (disregarding this section) would otherwise become
 payable, a report describing the alternative level of payments which
 the President instead intends to provide, including the reasons why such
 alternative level is considered necessary; and
 `(2) implement the alternative level of payments beginning on the same date
 as would otherwise apply, for the year involved, under section 5304.
 `(b) The requirements set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3), respectively,
 of section 5303(b) shall apply with respect to any decision to exercise

`Sec. 5305. Special pay authority
 `(a) Whenever the President finds that the Government's recruitment or
 retention efforts with respect to 1 or more occupations in 1 or more areas
 or locations are, or are likely to become, significantly handicapped,
 due to any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), he may
 establish for the areas or locations involved, with respect to individuals
 in positions paid under any of the pay systems referred to in subsection
 (c), higher minimum rates of basic pay for 1 or more grades or levels,
 occupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, and may make
 corresponding increases in all step rates of the pay range for each such
 grade or level. However, a minimum rate so established may not exceed the
 maximum pay rate prescribed by statute for the grade or level by more than
 30 percent, and no rate may be established under this section (disregarding
 any amount payable under subsection (g)) in excess of the rate of basic pay
 payable for level V of the Executive Schedule. The President may authorize
 the exercise of the authority conferred on him by this section by the Office
 of Personnel Management or, in the case of individuals not subject to the
 provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service,
 by such other agency as he may designate.
 `(b) The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are--
 `(1) rates of pay offered by non-Federal employers being significantly
 higher than those payable by the Government within the area, location,
 occupational group, or other class of positions under the pay system involved;
 `(2) the remoteness of the area or location involved;
 `(3) the undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the
 work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational
 hazards); or
 `(4) any other circumstances which the President (or an agency duly
 authorized or designated by the President in accordance with the last
 sentence of subsection (a)) considers appropriate.
 `(c) Authority under subsection (a) may be exercised with respect to
 positions paid under--
 `(1) a statutory pay system; or
 `(2) any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for
 civilian positions within the executive branch.
 `(d) Within the limitations applicable under the preceding provisions of
 this section, rates of pay established under this section may be revised
 from time to time by the President or by such agency as he may designate. The
 actions and revisions have the force and effect of statute.
 `(e) An increase in a rate of basic pay established under this section is
 not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of section 5335.
 `(f) The rate of basic pay established under this section and received
 by an individual immediately before a statutory increase, which becomes
 effective prior to, on, or after the date of enactment of the statute, in
 the pay schedule applicable to such individual of any pay system specified
 in subsection (c) of this section, shall be initially adjusted, effective
 on the effective date of the statutory increase, under conversion rules
 prescribed by the President or by such agency as the President may designate.
 `(g)(1) The benefit of any comparability payments under section 5304 shall
 be available to individuals receiving rates of basic pay established under
 this section to such extent as the President (or his designated agency)
 considers appropriate, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (h).
 `(2) Payments under this subsection may not be made if, or to the extent
 that, when added to basic pay otherwise payable, such payments would cause
 the total to exceed the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the
 Executive Schedule.
 `(h) The rate of basic pay payable to an individual under this section may
 not, at any time, be less than the rate which would then be payable to such
 individual (taking comparability payments under section 5304 into account)
 if this section had never been enacted.
`Sec. 5306. Pay fixed by administrative action
 `(a) Notwithstanding sections 1341, 1342, and 1349-1351 and subchapter II
 of chapter 15 of title 31--

 `(A) employees in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the
 Government of the United States (except employees whose pay is disbursed by

 fixed by administrative action under law and are not otherwise adjusted
 under this subchapter;
 `(B) employees under the Architect of the Capitol, whose rates of pay are
 fixed under section 166b-3 of title 40, and the Superintendent of Garages,
 House office buildings; and
 `(C) persons employed by the county committees established under section
 590h(b) of title 16; and
 `(2) and minimum or maximum rate of pay (other than a maximum rate equal
 to or greater than the maximum rate then currently being paid under the
 General Schedule as a result of a pay adjustment under section 5303 (or prior
 corresponding provision of law)), and any monetary limitation on or monetary
 allowance for pay, applicable to employees described in subparagraphs (A),
 (B), and (C) of paragraph (1);
may be adjusted, by the appropriate authority concerned, effective at the
beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the day
on which a pay adjustment becomes effective under section 5303 (or prior
provision of law), by whichever of the following methods the appropriate
authority concerned considers appropriate--
 `(i) by an amount or amounts not in excess of the pay adjustment provided
 under section 5303 for corresponding rates of pay in the appropriate schedule
 or scale of pay;
 `(ii) if there are no corresponding rates of pay, by an amount or amounts
 equal or equivalent, insofar as practicable and with such exceptions and
 modifications as may be necessary to provide for appropriate pay relationships
 between positions, to the amount of the pay adjustment provided under
 section 5303; or
 `(iii) in the case of minimum or maximum rates of pay, or monetary limitations
 of allowances with respect to pay, by an amount rounded to the nearest $100
 and computed on the basis of a percentage equal or equivalent, insofar as
 practicable and with such variations as may be appropriate, to the percentage
 of the pay adjustment provided under section 5303.
 `(b) An adjustment under subsection (a) in rates of pay, minimum or maximum
 rates of pay, the monetary limitations or allowances with respect to pay,
 shall be made in such manner as the appropriate authority concerned considers
 appropriate.
 `(c) This section does not authorize any adjustment in the rates of pay
 of employees whose rates of pay are fixed and adjusted from time to time
 as nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with
 prevailing rates or practices.
 `(d) This section does not impair any authority under which rates of pay
 may be fixed by administrative action.
 `(e) Pay may not be paid, by reason of any exercise of authority under this
 section, at a rate in excess of the rate of basic pay payable for level V
 of the Executive Schedule.
`Sec. 5307. Limitation on certain payments
 `(a) Except as otherwise permitted by or under law, no allowance,
 differential, bonus, award, or other similar cash payment under this title
 may be paid to an employee in a calendar year if, or to the extent that,
 when added to the total basic pay paid or payable to such employee for
 service performed in such calendar year as an employee in the executive
 branch (or as an employee outside the executive branch to whom chapter 51
 applies), such payment would cause to the total to exceed the annual rate
 of basic pay payable for level I of the Executive Schedule, as of the end
 of such calendar year.
 `(b)(1) Any amount which is not paid to an employee in a calendar year because
 of the limitation under subsection (a) shall be paid to such employee in
 a lump sum at the beginning of the following calendar year.
 `(2) Any amount paid under this subsection in a calendar year shall be taken
 into account for purposes of appying the limitations under subsection (a)
 with respect to such calendar year.
 `(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an amount if, or to the extent that,
 it is attributable to a payment the authority for which would derive from
 section 4505a(d), 5753(e), or 5754(e).
 `(c) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe such regulations as
 may be necessary to carry out this section, including regulations (consistent
 with section 5582) concerning how a lump-sum payment under subsection (b)
 shall be made with respect to any employee who dies before an amount payable
 to such employee under subsection (b) is made.'.

 directly threatened by the decision of the Government of Iraq to move them and
 use them as `human shields' at strategic defense and industrial installations;
 (3) the stability of world oil production and marketing has been threatened
 by the illegal Iraqi seizure of Kuwaiti ports and oil production facilities;
 (4) the United Nations has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, has voted
 to impose an economic embargo on Iraq, and has declared null and void the
 annexation of Kuwait;
 (5) the United Nations Security Council has approved the use of appropriate
 military force by individual nations to enforce United Nations sanctions;
 (6) the President of the United States has taken the lead in unifying world
 opinion and directing international efforts against the Iraqi aggression
 and in defense of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states;
 (7) a majority of Arab nations have condemned Iraq's actions and have
 supported Arab military and diplomatic efforts to defend the Gulf states
 and to ensure Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait;
 (8) the United States is deploying tens of thousands of American troops and
 military hardware to the Persian Gulf in defense of the strategic interests
 of the United States in the region at costs estimated to be in excess of
 $40 million a day, during a time of an increasing budget deficit;
 (9) a principle position of the United States and its NATO and major
 non-NATO allies is one of burdensharing in the collective defense of the
 Western alliance;
 (10) the Senate and the American people are deeply concerned about the need
 for a reduced budget deficit and improved economic growth; and
 (11) President George Bush has announced his intention to develop an economic
 action plan under which nations benefitting from the economic embargo and the
 military actions in the Persian Gulf assist those nations which are committing
 their military personnel and materiel to support these United Nations actions.
(b) It is the sense of the Senate that--
 (1) the President of the United States should be congratulated for taking the
 diplomatic initiative to encourage other nations to share the international
 financial burden of the defense of Saudi Arabia; and
 (2) the President of the United States--
 (A) in consultation with the allies of the United States in the Persian
 Gulf defense operation, should--
 (i) take steps to ensure that United States allies are sharing an appropriate
 portion of the collective defense of their interests in the Gulf;
 (ii) take steps to ensure that those allies who are precluded from any overt
 military participation in the Gulf, or who decide against participating
 in these defensive actions, or who only provide minimal participation
 are assuming an appropriate financial share of the collective defense
 commensurate with their national means; and
 (iii) take steps to ensure that those oil producing nations which may benefit
 from increased individual oil production and world oil prices as a result
 of the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil proportionally share the burden of
 the costs of the embargo, either directly with those nations providing the
 defense, or by equivalent `inkind' payments, or by assuming some of the
 other international financial burdens of the major defense-providing nations;

 Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and

 to be taken to meet the goals enumerated in subparagraphs (A) through (C).

 SEC. 632. CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD- (a) FINDINGS- The Senate
 finds that--
 (1) the future peace and prosperity of all nations depend upon the good
 health and well-being of the world's children;
 (2) the Congress has long recognized the vulnerability of children and has
 enacted numerous laws that afford them special protections in this country;
 (3) similar protections for children are either totally lacking or
 inadequately enforced in much of the world;
 (4) in part as a result of this lack of protection, millions of children are
 threatened daily by poverty, malnutrition, homelessness, exploitation and
 abuse, depriving both family and society of their productivity and potential;
 (5) the Child Survival and Development Revolution, launched in 1982 to
 attack the root causes of infant mortality and child ill-health  through
 low-cost means such as universal child immunization and oral rehydration
 therapy, is saving the lives of more than 3,000,000 children each year and
 has demonstrated that the number of child deaths can be reduced significantly
 if available resources are used appropriately;
 (6) despite these gains and an emerging international consensus about
 the importance of protecting children, children both here and abroad will
 continue to face poverty, sickness, and ill-treatment.
 (7) on November 20, 1989, the United States and other members of the United
 Nations unanimously endorsed the Convention on the Rights of the Child and
 urged national governments to ratify the Convention and make possible its
 application as international law;
 (8) this Convention, if implemented, will help establish universal
 legal standards for the care and protection of children against neglect,
 exploitation, and abuse;
 (9) the United States Government, scores of private voluntary organizations,
 and hundreds of American citizens were actively involved in the drafting
 of this Convention; and
 (10) the United States must continue playing a leading role in the
 implementation of the Convention to ensure that it becomes a force for
 improving the lot of children, both in this country and abroad.
 (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE- It is the sense of the Senate that the issue of
 children's rights and their well-being is important both to the United
 States and the world at large and that, in consideration thereof, the
 President should promptly seek the advice and consent of the Senate to the
 ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the
 United Nations with the support of the United States on November 29, 1989.

 this section) would otherwise be payable in such year would be equal to the

 SEC. 635. (a) The Congress finds that--
 (1) President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has attempted to evade the consequences
 of his illegal invasion of Kuwait by the taking of civilian hostages;
 (2) Saddam Hussein has violated standards of civilized conduct by willfully
 seeking to endanger the lives of foreign civilians in Kuwait and Iraq;
 (3) He has further violated international diplomatic practice by laying
 siege to Western embassies in Kuwait;
 (4) Iraq's conduct both at home and on the battlefield during the recent war
 with Iran has demonstrated a willingness to use the most barbaric methods
 of warfare, including the gassing of civilian women and children;
 (5) The Nuremberg principles, while denying national guilt for acts of
 war, do also stipulate that individual leaders may be held responsible for
 violations of the conventions of war and of civilized behavior;
 (6) The taking of hostages, the use of gas, the terrorizing of civilians
 and diplomats, and other such acts in both peace and war have long been
 considered crimes against humanity for which prosecution is justifiable.
 (b) It is the sense of the Senate that in the event of hostilities between
 the United States and the government of Iraq it shall be the policy of
 the United States to pursue Saddam Hussein, other Iraqi leaders, and other
 such perpetrators as may be determined responsible in order to bring them
 to justice as war criminals, and to seek their prosecution and punishment
 under the auspices of an international tribunal with relevant jurisdiction.
 This Act may be cited as the `Treasury, Postal Service and General Government
 Appropriations Act, 1991'.

President of the Senate.
