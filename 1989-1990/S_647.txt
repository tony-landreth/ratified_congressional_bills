 after notice and opportunity for hearing, that any person is violating,
 has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this title, or any
 rule or regulation thereunder, the Commission may publish its findings and
 enter an order requiring such person, and any other person that is, was,
 or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person
 knew or should have known would contribute to such violation, to cease and
 desist from committing or causing such violation and any future violation
 of the same provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to
 requiring a person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation,
 require such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with
 such provision, rule, or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within
 such time as the Commission may specify in such order. Any such order may,
 as the Commission deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to

 in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to
 investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not
 limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior
 to the completion of the proceedings, the Commission may enter a temporary
 order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the violation or
 threatened violation and to take such action to prevent the violation or
 threatened violation and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets,
 significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest as
 the Commission deems appropriate pending completion of such proceeding. Such
 an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
 unless the Commission determines that notice and hearing prior to entry
 would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest. A temporary
 order shall become effective upon service upon the respondent and, unless
 set aside, limited, or suspended by the Commission or a court of competent
 jurisdiction, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion
 of the proceedings.
 `(2) APPLICABILITY- This subsection shall apply only to a respondent
 that acts, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct acted, as a broker,

 respondent may, within 10 days after the date on which the order was served,
 request a hearing on such application and the Commission shall hold a hearing
 and render a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.
 `(2) JUDICIAL REVIEW- Within--
 `(A) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a temporary
 cease-and-desist order entered with a prior Commission hearing, or

 hearing under paragraph (1), with respect to any temporary cease-and-desist
 order entered without a prior Commission hearing,
the respondent may apply to the United States district court for the district
in which the respondent resides or has its principal place of business,
or for the District of Columbia, for an order setting aside, limiting,
or suspending the effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court
shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent served with a
temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing
may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Commission
on the respondent's application under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
 `(3) NO AUTOMATIC STAY OF TEMPORARY ORDER- The commencement of proceedings
 under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not, unless specifically
 ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission's order.

 cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew or should
 have known would contribute to such violation, to cease and desist from
 committing or causing such violation and any future violation of the same
 provision, rule, or regulation. Such order may, in addition to requiring a
 person to cease and desist from committing or causing a violation, require
 such person to comply, or to take steps to effect compliance, with such
 provision, rule, or regulation, upon such terms and conditions and within
 such time as the Commission may specify in such order. Any such order may,
 as the Commission deems appropriate, require future compliance or steps to

 investors, or substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not
 limited to, losses to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior

 order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the violation or
 threatened violation and to take such action to prevent the violation or
 threatened violation and to prevent dissipation or conversion of assets,
 significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public interest as
 the Commission deems appropriate pending completion of such proceedings. Such
 an order shall be entered only after notice and opportunity for a hearing,
 unless the Commission, notwithstanding section 40(a) of this title, determines
 that notice and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to
 the public interest. A temporary order shall become effective upon service
 upon the respondent and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by the
 Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall remain effective
 and enforceable pending the completion of the proceedings.
 `(B) APPLICABILITY- This paragraph shall apply only to a respondent
 that acts, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct acted, as a broker,
 dealer, investment adviser, investment company, municipal securities dealer,
 government securities broker, government securities dealer, or transfer agent,

 request a hearing on such application and the Commission shall hold a hearing
 and render a decision on such application at the earliest possible time.
 `(B) JUDICIAL REVIEW- Within--
 `(i) 10 days after the date the respondent was served with a temporary
 cease-and-desist order entered with a prior Commission hearing, or
 `(ii) 10 days after the Commission renders a decision on an application and
 hearing under subparagraph (A), with respect to any temporary cease-and-desist
 order entered without a prior Commission hearing,
the respondent may apply to the United States district court for the district
in which the respondent resides or has its principal place of business,
or for the District of Columbia, for an order setting aside, limiting,
or suspending the effectiveness or enforcement of the order, and the court
shall have jurisdiction to enter such an order. A respondent served with a
temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing
may not apply to the court except after hearing and decision by the Commission
on the respondent's application under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.
 `(C) NO AUTOMATIC STAY OF TEMPORARY ORDER- The commencement of proceedings
 under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not, unless specifically
 ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Commission's order.
 `(D) EXCLUSIVE REVIEW- Section 43 of this title shall not apply to a
 temporary order entered pursuant to this section.

TITLE V--PENNY STOCK REFORM
SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.
 This title may be cited as the `Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990'.
SEC. 502. FINDINGS.
 The Congress finds the following:
 (1) The maintenance of an honest and healthy primary and secondary market for
 securities offerings is essential to enhancing long-term capital formation
 and economic growth and providing legitimate investment opportunities for
 individuals and institutions.
 (2) Protecting investors in new securities is a critical component in the
 maintenance of an honest and healthy market for such securities.
 (3) Protecting issuers of new securities and promoting the capital formation
 process on behalf of small companies are fundamental concerns in maintaining
 a strong economy and viable trading markets.
 (4) Unscrupulous market practices and market participants have pervaded the
 `penny stock' market with an overwhelming amount of fraud and abuse.
 (5) Although the Securities and Exchange Commission, State securities
 regulators, and securities self-regulators have made efforts to curb
 these abusive and harmful practices, the penny stock market still lacks an
 adequate and sufficient regulatory structure, particularly in comparison
 to the structure for overseeing trading in National Market System securities.
 (6) Investors in the penny stock market suffer from a serious lack of
 adequate information concerning price and volume of penny stock transactions,
 the nature of this market, and the specific securities in which they are
 investing.
 (7) Current practices do not adequately regulate the role of `promoters' and
 `consultants' in the penny stock market, and many professionals who have been
 banned from the securities markets have ended up in promoter and consultant
 roles, contributing substantially to fraudulent and abusive schemes.
 (8) The present regulatory environment has permitted the ascendancy of the
 use of particular market practices, such as `reverse mergers' with shell
 corporations and `blank check' offerings, which are used to facilitate
 manipulation schemes and harm investors.
 (9) In light of the substantial and continuing problems in the penny stock
 markets, additional legislative measures are necessary and appropriate.
SEC. 503. DEFINITION OF PENNY STOCK.
 Section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a))
 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraph:
 `(51)(A) The term `penny stock' means any equity security other than a
 security that is--
 `(i) registered or approved for registration and traded on a national
 securities exchange that meets such criteria as the Commission shall
 prescribe by rule or regulation for purposes of this paragraph;
 `(ii) authorized for quotation on an automated quotation system sponsored
 by a registered securities association, if such system (I) was established
 and in operation before January 1, 1990, and (II) meets such criteria as
 the Commission shall prescribe by rule or regulation for purposes of this
 paragraph;
 `(iii) issued by an investment company registered under the Investment
 Company Act of 1940;
 `(iv) excluded, on the basis of exceeding a minimum price, net tangible
 assets of the issuer, or other relevant criteria, from the definition of
 such term by rule or regulation which the Commission shall prescribe for
 purposes of this paragraph; or
 `(v) exempted, in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally,
 from the definition of such term by rule, regulation, or order prescribed
 by the Commission.
 `(B) The Commission may, by rule, regulation, or order, designate any
 equity security or class of equity securities described in clause (i) or
 (ii) of subparagraph (A) as within the meaning of the term `penny stock'
 if such security or class of securities is traded other than on a national
 securities exchange or through an automated quotation system described in
 clause (ii) of subparagraph (A).
 `(C) In exercising its authority under this paragraph to prescribe rules,
 regulations, and orders, the Commission shall determine that such rule,
 regulation, or order is consistent with the public interest and the protection
 of investors.'.
SEC. 504. EXPANSION OF SECTION 15(b) SANCTION AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO
PENNY STOCKS.
 (a) AMENDMENT- Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(6)) is amended to read as follows:

 become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was
 associated or was seeking to become associated with a broker or dealer, or
 any person participating, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, who was
 participating, in an offering of any penny stock, the Commission, by order,
 shall censure, place limitations on the activities or functions of such
 person, or suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or bar such person
 from being associated with a broker or dealer, or from participating in an
 offering of penny stock, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice
 and opportunity for a hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations,

 (A), (D), or (E) of paragraph (4) of this subsection;
 `(ii) has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of

 of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to improve
 significantly the information available to brokers, dealers, investors,
 and regulators with respect to quotations for and transactions in penny
 stocks; and

 meet the information needs of investors and market participants and would
 add visibility and regulatory and surveillance data to that market.

 `(A) be operated by a registered securities association or a national
 securities exchange in accordance with such rules as the Commission and
 these entities shall prescribe;

 `(C) except as provided in subsection (c), provide bid and ask quotations
 of participating brokers or dealers, or comparably accurate and reliable
 pricing information, which shall constitute firm bids or offers for at least
 such minimum numbers of shares or minimum dollar amounts as the Commission
 and the registered securities association or national securities exchange
 shall require; and
 `(D) provide for the reporting of the volume of penny stock transactions,
 including last sale reporting, when the volume reaches appropriate levels
 that the Commission shall specify by rule or order.
 `(c) EXEMPTIVE AUTHORITY- The Commission may, by rule or order, grant such
 exemptions, in whole or in part, conditionally or unconditionally, to any
 penny stock or class of penny stocks from the requirements of subsection
 (b) as the Commission determines to be consistent with the public interest,
 the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.

 to registration statements filed by any issuer that is a blank check
 company. Such rules may, as the Commission determines necessary or appropriate
 in the public interest or for the protection of investors--
 `(A) require such issuers to provide timely disclosure, prior to or after such
