Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing February 18, 1990, and ending February 24,
1990, as `National Visiting Nurse Associations Week'.
Whereas Visiting Nurse Associations have served homebound Americans since 1885;
Whereas such Associations annually provide home care and support services
to nearly 1,000,000 men, women, children, and infants;
Whereas such Associations serve 504 urban and rural communities in 47 States;
Whereas such Associations adhere to high standards of quality and provide
personalized and cost-effective home health care and support regardless of
an individual's ability to pay;
Whereas such Associations are voluntary in nature; independently owned and
community-based;
Whereas such Associations ensure the quality of care through oversight provided
by professional advisory committees composed of local physicians and nurses;
Whereas such Associations enable hundreds of thousands of Americans to
recover from illness and injury in the comfort and security of their homes;
Whereas such Associations ensure that individuals who are chronically ill
or who have physical and mental handicaps receive the therapeutic benefits
of care and support services provided in the home;
Whereas, in the absence of such Associations, thousands of patients with
mental or physical handicaps or chronically disabling illnesses would have
to be institutionalized;
Whereas such Associations provide a wide range of services, including
(where appropriate) health care, hospice care, personal care, homemaking,
occupational, physical, and speech therapy, `friendly visiting services',
social services, nutritional counseling, specialized nursing services,
and meals on wheels;
Whereas such Associations offer nursing care provided by registered nurses,
homemaking, therapy, and social services by qualified specialists, and
`friendly visiting services' by volunteers;
Whereas in each community served by such an Association, local volunteers
support the Association by serving on the board of directors, raising funds,
visiting patients in their homes, assisting patients and nurses at wellness
clinics, delivering meals on wheels to patients, running errands for patients,
working in the Association's office, and providing tender loving care; and
Whereas the need for home health care for young and old alike continues to
grow annually: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing February 18,
 1990, and ending February 24, 1990, is designated as `National Visiting
 Nurse Associations Week', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
