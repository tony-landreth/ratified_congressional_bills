AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate October 30, 1990, as `Refugee Day'.
Whereas in the past decade the world refugee population has more than doubled
from 7,300,000 to 15,000,000;
Whereas the United States has always played a leading role in refugee
matters worldwide;
Whereas the origins of the United States as a land of refuge for those
escaping persecution and the development of the United States as a nation
of immigrants gives the country a deep understanding of and sympathy for
the plight of the 15,000,000 refugees in the world;
Whereas refugees who have come to the United States have made significant
contributions to the country;
Whereas the United States consistently encourages other countries to expand
efforts to help the needy population of refugees;
Whereas the current world refugee situation requires that the United States
continue to be a leader in refugee affairs: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) October 30, 1990, is designated as `Refugee Day'; and
 (2) the President is authorized   and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling on the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
