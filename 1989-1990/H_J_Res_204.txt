One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate October 1989, as `National Quality Month'.
Whereas the design and manufacture of quality commercial products and goods
and the provision of services of the highest quality are fundamental to the
success of the United States in the world marketplace, to the improvement
of the standard of living of the people of the United States, and to the
security of the United States;
Whereas the United States has been a world leader in producing quality goods
and services and the leadership has resulted in a world-wide market for the
products of the United States;
Whereas in recent years, the leadership of the United States in producing
quality goods has been challenged by foreign competition and the rate of growth
of the productivity of the United States is currently less than the rate of
growth of the productivity of some of the competitors of the United States;
Whereas a commitment to continuous quality improvement, using recognized
quality principles and practices, has been demonstrated to be the most
effective way to regain and solidify economic leadership in the world
marketplace;
Whereas over the past 5 years, virtually every segment of business and
industry in the United States and many units of government have adopted
quality management principles and experienced resulting dramatic improvements
in productivity;
Whereas the Federal Government promotes quality through such programs as the
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award of the Department of Commerce, the
Federal Quality Institute, the President's Council on Management Improvement,
the Productivity Improvement Plan of the Department of Defense, and the
Excellence Award for Quality and Productivity of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration;
Whereas regional quality movements have promoted quality management philosophy
and quality management principles and have begun to develop a sense of
quality consciousness within particular regions of the Nation;
Whereas cognizance of quality, like cognizance of safety, is an attitude
that once instilled in individuals becomes ingrained;
Whereas implementation of quality principles in manufacturing and service
operations increases productivity through emphasis on waste reduction,
defect prevention, and improved reliability of products and services;
Whereas the American Society for Quality Control has been a leader in the
development, promotion, and application of quality and quality-related
technology since 1946;
Whereas the American Society for Quality Control, together with other national
professional organizations, business, industry, government, and academia, is
sponsoring activities to observe National Quality Month to promote awareness
of the need for quality in production and services throughout the United
States; and
Whereas the theme of National Quality Month will be `Quality First', to
emphasize that quality is an integral part of the processes that create
goods and services: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1989 is designated as `National
 Quality Month', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
