S.J.Res.177
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate October 29, 1989, as `Fire Safety At Home--Change Your Clock,
Change
Your Battery Day'.
Whereas every year, 500,000 fires ravage the homes of Americans, resulting
in over 6,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries;
Whereas home fires are the leading cause of accidental death and serious
injury among children in the United States;
Whereas senior citizens, families in substandard housing, and the physically
and mentally disabled are at high risk of becoming victims of fire;
Whereas 3 out of 4 homes have at least 1 smoke detector, but an estimated
one-half are inoperable because of worn or missing batteries;
Whereas the International Association of Fire Chiefs estimates that the annual
practice of changing batteries in smoke detectors would save thousands of
lives and billions of dollars in property damage;
Whereas the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, with its broad-based bipartisan
membership, reflects the concern of Congress for fire safety and its dedication
to making it an important national priority;
Whereas the designation of a special day to remind Americans to properly
maintain their smoke detectors, timed to coincide with the autumnal return
to Standard Time, would greatly diminish this human tragedy; and
Whereas October 29, 1989, is the day Americans in jurisdictions on Daylight
Savings Time return their clocks to Standard Time: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 29, 1989, is designated as
 `Fire Safety at Home--Change Your Clock, and Change Your Battery Day',
 and the President is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the
 people of the United States to observe that day by maintaining their homes'
 first line of defense against fire by changing the batteries in their smoke
 detectors when they reset their clocks to Standard Time.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
