H.J.Res.379
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Commending the citizens of the Sioux City, Iowa, tri-State area for their
heroism and spirit of volunteerism in selflessly providing assistance and
life-saving services to the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 232.
Whereas United Airlines Flight 232 tragically crashed while making an
emergency landing attempt at the Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa,
on July 19, 1989;
Whereas the skills and courage of the pilot, flight crew, and air traffic
controllers, and the immediate mobilization of State and local rescue units
from Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota, significantly contributed to the
survival of 185 of the 296 passengers aboard the flight;
Whereas the disaster plan which had been designed by the Woodbury County
Disaster Committee was largely responsible for the remarkable success of
the rescue effort;
Whereas the people of the Sioux City, Iowa, tri-State area mobilized without
hesitation to provide aid and comfort to the injured;
Whereas by the time that United Airlines Flight 232 touched down, the
Sioux Gateway Crash, Fire, and Rescue Squad, the 185th Tactical Fighter
Group of the Iowa Air National Guard, members of city police forces and
county sheriffs' departments, municipal firefighters, Red Cross workers,
and other local rescue teams were on the scene to immediately begin to help
the wounded and transport them for treatment;
Whereas the physicians, nurses, and other personnel of St. Luke's Regional
Medical Center and the Marian Health Center worked exhaustively to treat
the injured;
Whereas hundreds of people in the Sioux City, Iowa, tri-State area donated
blood at a local bloodbank without solicitation to assist in the treatment
efforts;
Whereas Briar Cliff College and Morningside College opened their dormitories to
the survivors, the families of the survivors, rescue teams, and investigators
while residents contributed blankets, clothing, and food; and
Whereas had it not been for the remarkable speed, skill, and preparedness
of the emergency crews, and the assistance and generosity of the people of
the Sioux City, Iowa, tri-State area, the number of survivors would likely
have been much lower: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the citizens of the Sioux City, Iowa,
 tri-State area are commended for their heroism and spirit of volunteerism in
 selflessly providing assistance and life-saving services to the passengers
 and crew of United Airlines Flight 232, and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation making such commendation.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
