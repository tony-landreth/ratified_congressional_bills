Joint Resolution
Designating October 3, 1990, as `National Teacher Appreciation Day'.
Whereas education of the Nation's youth is the foundation of the Nation's
future;
Whereas education is a lifelong process which is beneficial to the individual
and thus beneficial to the entire Nation;
Whereas teachers deserve credit for their invaluable role in providing
education;
Whereas teaching not only involves traditional areas of education, but today
also includes vocational education, continuing education, and education for
special needs;
Whereas teachers contribute not only to the academic growth of students,
but also to their ethical, social, and emotional development;
Whereas a student's respect for his or her teacher is essential to the
student's ability to learn; and
Whereas the contributions of teachers should be celebrated often in order
to honor the role of teachers in society and to affirm and foster respect
for teachers: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 3, 1990, is designated as
 `National Teacher Appreciation Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
