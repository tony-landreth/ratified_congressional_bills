One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating September 1989 as `National Library Card Sign-Up Month'.
Whereas American libraries of all kinds (public libraries, school library
media centers, academic and research libraries, and special libraries) are
essential to national literacy, lifelong learning, and a productive economy;
Whereas children who are read to in their homes at an early age and who grow
up regularly using libraries perform better in school and are more likely
to continue to be library users as adults;
Whereas the United States National Commission on Libraries and Information
Science and the American Library Association have launched a national
campaign to ensure that every school-age child in the Nation will have,
and will be encouraged to use, a library card;
Whereas a library card cannot be outgrown and is good for a lifetime of
learning and enjoyment;
Whereas parents and schools are important partners in the effort to give
the wonderful gift of a library card to every child in the Nation; and
Whereas a library card is an essential resource for every child's education
and September is the month during which children return to school: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That September 1989 is designated as
 `National Library Card Sign-Up Month', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the libraries, schools, and
 people of the United States to observe such month with appropriate programs,
 ceremonies, and activities.
