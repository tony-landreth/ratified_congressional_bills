One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating February 16, 1991, as `Lithuanian Independence Day'.
Whereas February 16, 1991, is the 73d anniversary of the declaration of
independence of Lithuania;
Whereas on February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania, the sole representative
of the Lithuanian people, in conformity with the recognized right to national
self-determination, proclaimed the restoration of an independent and democratic
Lithuania and ended all ties that formally subordinated Lithuania to other
nations;
Whereas Lithuania was independent until 1940 when the Soviet Union took over
the country;
Whereas the United States opposes tyranny and injustice in all forms and
supports the cause of Lithuanian independence; and
Whereas the oppressed people currently living in Lithuania keep the flame
of freedom forever burning in their hearts: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That February 16, 1991, is designated as
 `Lithuanian Independence Day', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 celebrate such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
