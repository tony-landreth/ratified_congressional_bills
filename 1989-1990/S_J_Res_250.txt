One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating April 1990 as `National Recycling Month'.
Whereas the continued generation of enormous volumes of solid waste each
year presents unacceptable threats to human health and the environment;
Whereas several regions of the United States are experiencing a severe
shortage of disposal capacity for municipal solid waste;
Whereas as a result of the inability to find sites for new solid waste
management facilities, many communities are managing waste in facilities
that were not designed with the best available environmental controls;
Whereas the generation of hazardous waste and solid waste must be reduced and
as much remaining waste as possible must be recycled to protect human health
and the environment and to minimize treatment and disposal capacity problems;
Whereas a significant amount of waste can be diverted from disposal by the
utilization of source separation, mechanical separation, and community-based
recycling programs;
Whereas local governments should be an integral component of the decisionmaking
process regarding the management of municipal solid waste;
Whereas developing a system of waste management that, to the greatest extent
practicable, separates elements of the waste stream that require special
management or that are in demand for reuse or recycling will enhance the
economic feasibility and environmental safety of all management methods,
including recycling, incineration, and land disposal;
Whereas source reduction and recycling represent the most environmentally
sound means of managing municipal solid waste and can often be carried out
with a lower cost than is incurred by other means;
Whereas recycling preserves limited landfill capacity and reduces the amount
of solid waste intended for incineration;
Whereas recycling can save energy and avoid the pollution created from
extracting resources from their natural environment;
Whereas the revenues recovered by recycling programs offset the costs of
solid waste management;
Whereas a well-developed system of recycling scrap metals, paper, and glass
already exists and is significantly reducing the quantity of solid waste
entering landfills or incinerators;
Whereas the technology for recycling plastic is currently under development,
and progress continues toward increasing potential markets;
Whereas many consumer products are designed without sufficient regard for
safe and efficient recycling after disposal;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments should promote the design of
products that can be recycled safely and efficiently;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments should enact legislative
measures that will increase the amount of solid waste that is recycled;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments should encourage the growth
of incremental markets for materials recovered from recyclable goods;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments should establish incentives
for household separation of waste to encourage recycling;
Whereas the success of source reduction and recycling programs depends on
the participation of an informed public; and
Whereas the people of the United States should be encouraged to participate in
educational and legislative endeavors that promote waste separation methods,
community-based recycling programs, and expanded utilization of recovered
materials: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That April 1990 is designated as `National
 Recycling Month', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
