Joint Resolution
Designating August 7, 1990, as `National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day'.
Whereas neighborhood crime is of continuing concern to the American people;
Whereas the fight against neighborhood crime requires people to work together
in cooperation with law enforcement officials;
Whereas neighborhood crime watch organizations are effective at promoting
awareness of, and participation of volunteers in, crime prevention activities
at the local level;
Whereas neighborhood crime watch groups can contribute to the national war
on drugs by helping to prevent their communities from becoming markets for
drug dealers;
Whereas citizens across the United States will soon take part in a `National
Night Out', a unique crime prevention event which will demonstrate the
importance and effectiveness of community participation in crime prevention
efforts by having people spend the period from 8 to 10 o'clock p.m. on August
7, 1990, with their neighbors in front of their homes: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That August 7, 1990, is designated as
 `National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United
 States to observe National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day with appropriate
 programs, ceremonies, and activities.
