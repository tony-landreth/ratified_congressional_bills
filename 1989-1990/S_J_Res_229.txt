One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate April 1990 as `National Prevent-A-Litter Month'.
Whereas the irresponsibility of some dog and cat owners in allowing
uncontrolled breeding of their pets has created a pet overpopulation problem
in the United States;
Whereas the pet overpopulation problem results in the destruction of millions
of dogs and cats each year;
Whereas the pet overpopulation problem results in other cruelties to pets
caused by neglect, such as abandonment, starvation, and injury;
Whereas the cruelties inflicted on pets result not only in lost animal lives
but also in lost resources spent by thousands of communities to shelter
neglected and displaced pets;
Whereas the pet overpopulation problem can be solved only by active promotion
of pet owner responsibility programs that include spaying and neutering of
pets, proper care and sheltering of pets, and compliance with animal control
regulations; and
Whereas the people of the United States should commit themselves to preventing
the needless destruction of pets by practicing responsible pet ownership
and by spaying and neutering pets as a means of combating the problem of
pet overpopulation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That April 1990 is designated as `National
 Prevent-A-Litter Month', and the President of the United States is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
