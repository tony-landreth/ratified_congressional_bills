S.J.Res.73
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning October 29, 1989, as `Gaucher's Disease
Awareness Week'.
Whereas Gaucher's disease is caused by the failure of the body to produce
an essential enzyme;
Whereas the absence of such enzyme causes the body to store abnormal quantities
of lipids in the liver and spleen and frequently has an adverse effect on
tissues in the body, particularly bone tissue;
Whereas among Jewish persons, Gaucher's disease is the most common inherited
disorder affecting the metabolism of lipids, which are one of the principle
structural components of living cells;
Whereas there is no known cure for Gaucher's disease and no successful
treatment of the symptoms of the disease;
Whereas the increased awareness and understanding of Gaucher's disease by
the people of the United States can aid in the development of a treatment
and cure for the disease;
Whereas the National Gaucher's Disease Foundation provides funds for research
in the United States with respect to the disease; and
Whereas research and clinical programs with respect to Gaucher's disease
should be increased: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning October 29, 1989,
 is designated as `Gaucher's Disease Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
