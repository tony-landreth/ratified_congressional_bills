 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 This Act may be cited as the `Native American Graves Protection and
 Repatriation Act'.
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.
 For purposes of this Act, the term--
 (1) `burial site' means any natural or prepared physical location, whether
 originally below, on, or above the surface of the earth, into which as a
 part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, individual human remains
 are deposited.
 (2) `cultural affiliation' means that there is a relationship of shared
 group identity which can be reasonably traced historically or prehistorically
 between a present day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and  an
 identifiable earlier group.
 (3) `cultural items' means human remains and--
 (A) `associated funerary objects' which shall mean objects that, as a
 part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed
 to have been placed with individual human remains either at the time of
 death or later, and both the human remains and associated funerary objects
 are presently in the possession or control of a Federal agency or museum,
 except that other items exclusively made for burial purposes or to contain
 human remains shall be considered as associated funerary objects.
 (B) `unassociated funerary objects' which shall mean objects that, as a part
 of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably believed to have
 been placed with individual human remains either at the time of death or
 later, where the remains are not in the possession or control of the Federal
 agency or museum and the objects can be identified by a preponderance of
 the evidence as related to specific individuals or families or to known
 human remains or, by a preponderance of the evidence, as having been removed
 from a specific burial site of an individual culturally affiliated with a
 particular Indian tribe,
 (C) `sacred objects' which shall mean specific ceremonial objects which are
 needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the practice
 of traditional Native American religions by their present day adherents, and
 (D) `cultural patrimony' which shall mean an object having ongoing historical,
 traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or
 culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual Native American,
 and which, therefore, cannot be alienated, appropriated, or conveyed by
 any individual regardless of whether or not the individual is a member of
 the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and such object shall have
 been considered inalienable by such Native American group at the time the
 object was separated from such group.
 (4) `Federal agency' means any department, agency, or instrumentality of
 the United States. Such term does not include the Smithsonian Institution.
 (5) `Federal lands' means any land other than tribal lands which are
 controlled or owned by the United States, including lands selected by but
 not yet conveyed to Alaska Native Corporations and groups organized pursuant
 to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.
 (6) `Hui Malama  I Na Kupuna O Hawai'i Nei' means the nonprofit, Native
 Hawaiian organization incorporated under the laws of the State of Hawaii
 by that name on April 17, 1989, for the purpose of providing guidance
 and expertise in decisions dealing with Native Hawaiian cultural issues,
 particularly burial issues.
 (7) `Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation, or other organized group
 or community of Indians, including any Alaska Native village (as defined in,
 or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act), which
 is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided
 by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
 (8) `museum' means any institution or State or local government agency
 (including any institution of higher learning) that receives Federal funds
 and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural items. Such
 term does not include the Smithsonian Institution or any other Federal agency.
 (9) `Native American' means of, or relating to, a tribe, people, or culture
 that is indigenous to the United States.
 (10) `Native Hawaiian' means any individual who is a descendant of the
 aboriginal people who, prior to 1778, occupied and exercised sovereignty
 in the area that now constitutes the State of Hawaii.

 (B) has as a primary and stated purpose the provision of services to Native
 Hawaiians, and

shall include the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O
Hawai'i Nei.
 (12) `Office of Hawaiian Affairs' means the Office of Hawaiian Affairs
 established by the constitution of the State of Hawaii.
 (13) `right of possession' means possession obtained with the voluntary
 consent of an individual or group that had authority of alienation. The
 original acquisition of a Native American unassociated funerary object,
 sacred object or object of cultural patrimony from an Indian tribe or Native
 Hawaiian organization with the voluntary consent of an individual or group
 with authority to alienate such object is deemed to give right of possession
 of that object, unless the phrase so defined would, as applied in section
 7(c), result in a Fifth Amendment taking by the United States as determined
 by the United States Claims Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1491 in which event
 the `right of possession' shall be as provided under otherwise applicable
 property law. The original acquisition of Native American human remains
 and associated funerary objects which were excavated, exhumed, or otherwise
 obtained with full knowledge and consent of the next of kin or the official
 governing body of the appropriate culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native
 Hawaiian organization is deemed to give right of possession to those remains.
 (14) `Secretary' means the Secretary of the Interior.
 (15) `tribal land' means--
 (A) all lands within the exterior boundaries of any Indian reservation;
 (B) all dependent Indian communities;
 (C) any lands administered for the benefit of Native Hawaiians pursuant to
 the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, and section 4 of Public Law 86-3.

 associated funerary objects shall compile an inventory of such items and, to
 the extent possible based on information possessed by such museum or Federal
 agency, identify the geographical and cultural affiliation of such item.

 supply additional available documentation to supplement the information
 required by subsection (a) of this section. The term `documentation' means a
 summary of existing museum or Federal agency records, including inventories
 or catalogues, relevant studies, or other pertinent data for the limited
 purpose of determining the geographical origin, cultural affiliation, and
 basic facts surrounding acquisition and accession of Native American human
 remains and associated funerary objects subject to this section. Such term

 objects that are not clearly identifiable as being culturally affiliated
 with that Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, but which, given the
 totality of circumstances surrounding acquisition of the remains or objects,
 are determined by a reasonable belief to be remains or objects culturally
 affiliated with the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.
 (3) A copy of each notice provided under paragraph (1) shall be sent to
 the Secretary who shall publish each notice in the Federal Register.
 (e) INVENTORY- For the purposes of this section, the term `inventory'

SEC. 7. REPATRIATION.
 (a) REPATRIATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS AND OBJECTS POSSESSED OR
 CONTROLLED BY FEDERAL AGENCIES AND MUSEUMS- (1) If, pursuant to section 5,
 the cultural affiliation of Native American human remains and associated
 funerary objects with a particular Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian
 organization is established, then the Federal agency or museum, upon the
 request of a known lineal descendant of the Native American or of the tribe
 or organization and pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) of this section,
 shall expeditiously return such remains and associated funerary objects.
 (2) If, pursuant to section 6, the cultural affiliation with a particular
 Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization is shown with respect to
 unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural
 patrimony, then the Federal agency or museum, upon the request of the Indian
 tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and pursuant to subsections (b),
 (c) and (e) of this section, shall expeditiously return such objects.
 (3) The return of cultural items covered by this Act shall be in consultation
 with the requesting lineal descendant or tribe or organization to determine
 the place and manner of delivery of such items.
 (4) Where cultural affiliation of Native American human remains and funerary
 objects has not been established in an inventory prepared pursuant to section
 5, or the summary pursuant to section 6, or where Native American human
 remains and funerary objects are not included upon any such inventory, then,
 upon request and pursuant to subsections (b) and (e) and, in the case of
 unassociated funerary objects, subsection (c), such Native American human
 remains and funerary objects shall be expeditiously returned where the
 requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show cultural
 affiliation by a preponderance of the evidence based upon geographical,
 kinship, biological, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric,
 oral traditional, historical, or other relevant information or expert opinion.

 who owned the sacred object;
 (B) the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show
 that the object was owned or controlled by the tribe or organization; or
 (C) the requesting Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization can show that
 the sacred object was owned or controlled by a member thereof, provided that
 in the case where a sacred object was owned by a member thereof, there are
 no identifiable lineal descendants of said member or the lineal descendants,
 upon notice, have failed to make a claim for the object under this Act.
 (b) SCIENTIFIC STUDY- If the lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or Native
 Hawaiian organization requests the return of culturally affiliated Native
 American cultural items, the Federal agency or museum shall expeditiously
 return such items unless such items are indispensable for completion of a
 specific scientific study, the outcome of which would be of major benefit
 to the United States. Such items shall be returned by no later than 90 days
 after the date on which the scientific study is completed.
 (c) STANDARD OF REPATRIATION- If a known lineal descendant or an Indian
 tribe or Native Hawaiian organization requests the return of Native American
 unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of cultural patrimony
 pursuant to this Act and presents evidence which, if standing alone before
 the introduction of evidence to the contrary, would support a finding
 that the Federal agency or museum did not have the right of possession,
 then such agency or museum shall return such objects unless it can overcome
 such inference and prove that it has a right of possession to the objects.
 (d) SHARING OF INFORMATION BY FEDERAL AGENCIES AND MUSEUMS- Any Federal
 agency or museum shall share what information it does possess regarding
 the object in question with the known lineal descendant, Indian tribe, or
 Native Hawaiian organization to assist in making a claim under this section.

 otherwise resolved pursuant to the provisions of this Act or by a court of
 competent jurisdiction.
