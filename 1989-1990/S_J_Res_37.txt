One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning May 14, 1989, and the week beginning May 13,
1990, as `National Osteoporosis Prevention Week'.
Whereas osteoporosis, a degenerative bone condition, afflicts 25,000,000
people in the United States;
Whereas osteoporosis afflicts 90 percent of women over age 75;
Whereas 50 percent of all women in the United States over age 45 will develop
some form of osteoporosis;
Whereas hip fractures are the most disabling outcome of osteoporosis, and
32 percent of women and 17 percent of men who live to age 90 will likely
suffer a hip fracture due primarily to osteoporosis;
Whereas the mortality rates for people who suffer a hip fracture increase
by 20 percent, with such fractures resulting in the death of over 50,000
older women and many older men each year;
Whereas 15 to 25 percent of people who suffer a hip fracture stay in a
long-term care facility for at least one year after the fracture occurs, and
25 to 35 percent of people who return home from a long-term care facility
after recovering from a hip fracture require assistance with daily living
after returning home;
Whereas the total cost to society of dealing with osteoporosis was over
$10,000,000,000 in 1988 and such cost is expected to rise as the population
ages;
Whereas osteoporosis is associated with the loss of bone mass due to a lack
of estrogen as a result of menopause, alcohol or cigarette use, and low
calcium intake;
Whereas exercise and proper nutrition before an individual is age 35 will
build bone mass to help prevent osteoporosis; and
Whereas people who suffer from osteoporosis should be aware of the increased
risk of bone fractures, and should take precautions to reduce the chance of
accidents that may result in bone fractures due primarily to osteoporosis:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning May 14, 1989, and
 the week beginning May 13, 1990, are designated as `National Osteoporosis
 Prevention Week', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe such week with appropriate programs and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

and 32 percent of women and 17 percent of men who live to age 90 will likely
suffer a hip fracture due primarily to osteoporosis;
