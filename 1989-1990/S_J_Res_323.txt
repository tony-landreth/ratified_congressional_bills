One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating November 11 through 17, 1990, as `Geography Awareness Week'.
Whereas geography is the study of people, their environments, and their
resources;
Whereas the United States is a truly unique Nation with diverse landscapes,
bountiful resources, a distinctive multiethnic population, and a rich cultural
heritage, all of which contribute to the status of the United States as a
world power;
Whereas the leadership of the United States in world affairs is threatened
by a lack of understanding of the locations and significance of historic
changes occurring around the globe;
Whereas a knowledge of geography provides a `Window on a Changing World'
and a way in which to understand events and their impact on the United States;
Whereas the United States is a Nation of worldwide involvements and influence,
the responsibilities of which demand an understanding of the lands, languages,
and cultures of the world;
Whereas geography today offers perspectives and information in understanding
ourselves, our relationship to the Earth, and our interdependence with other
peoples of the world;
Whereas the first federally funded National Assessment of Educational Progress
survey revealed a `disturbing geography knowledge gap' among 12th graders
in the United States;
Whereas this survey also indicated that many students did not know that the
Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico, or that the Panama Canal
shortens sailing time between the east and west coasts of the United States,
nor could they identify Jerusalem on a regional map, or name the three oceans
moving east around the globe from Africa;
Whereas departments of geography are being eliminated from institutes of
higher learning in the United States, thus endangering the discipline of
geography in this country;
Whereas, while geography as a distinct discipline has virtually disappeared
from the curricula of schools in the United States, it is still being taught
as a basic subject in other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada,
Japan, and the Soviet Union;
Whereas an ignorance of geography, foreign languages, and cultures places the
United States at a disadvantage with other countries in matters of business,
politics, the environment, and global events;
Whereas one-third of adults in the United States cannot name four of the
sixteen North Atlantic Treaty Organization member nations, and another
one-third cannot name any; and
Whereas national attention must be focused on the integral role that
knowledge of world geography plays in preparing citizens of the United
States for the future of an increasingly interdependent, interconnected,
and rapidly changing world: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of November 11 through 17, 1990,
 is designated as `Geography Awareness Week', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
