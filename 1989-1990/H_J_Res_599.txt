To designate July 1, 1990, as `National Ducks and Wetlands Day'.
Whereas the United States converts almost 500,000 acres of wetlands to other

and uses all funds raised by the sale of the stamp to acquire wildlife
habitat in the form of wetlands that support both waterfowl and other wildlife;
Whereas the United States Postal Service sells more than 1,500,000 duck
stamps annually;
Whereas citizens of the United States have purchased duck stamps for over
half a century to support the conservation benefits of saving wetlands;
Whereas the sale of duck stamps has raised more than $400,000,000 since the
inception of the program, and these proceeds have been used to acquire almost
4,000,000 acres of prime habitat for the National Refuge System;
Whereas on Sunday, July 1, 1990, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the
Department of the Interior will issue a Federal duck stamp that will go on
sale at post offices nationwide;
Whereas according to popular tradition, the artist who designed the new
stamp will be honored at a First Day of Sale Ceremony to be held near the
hometown of the artist;
Whereas the United States Postal Service will host a ceremony at the new
Minnesota Valley Wildlife Refuge Visitors Center to honor the fourteenth
duck stamp to be designed by a Minnesota artist; and
Whereas the citizens of Minnesota have dedicated an afternoon program of
ceremony, information, and family activities to support the conservation of
wetlands and waterfowl: Now, therefore, be it

 of America in Congress assembled, That July 1, 1990, is designated as
