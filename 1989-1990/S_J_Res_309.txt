AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

Joint Resolution
Designating the month of October 1990 as `Crime Prevention Month'.
Whereas it has been proven that community crime prevention efforts are
reducing victimization by crime and helping to rebuild a sense of mutual
responsibility and shared pride in community;
Whereas the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign, featuring McGruff
the Crime Dog and promoted by the United States Department of Justice,
the National Crime Prevention Council, the Advertising Council, and the
Crime Prevention Coalition, helps spur diverse local partnerships among law
enforcement agencies, citizens, businesses, and government which work to
reduce crime and improve community life throughout the Nation; and
Whereas the 10th anniversary of McGruff the Crime Dog as a symbol of the
Nation's fight against crime and drugs will be celebrated in October 1990:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of October 1990 is designated
 as `Crime Prevention Month', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
