H.J.Res.282
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating November 19-25, 1989, as `National Family Caregivers Week'.
Whereas the number of Americans who are age 65 or older is growing;
Whereas there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of persons
who are age 85 or older;
Whereas the incidence of frailty and disability increases among persons of
advanced age;
Whereas approximately 5.2 million older persons have disabilities that leave
them in need of help with their daily tasks, including food preparation,
dressing, and bathing;
Whereas families provide older persons help with such tasks, in addition to
providing between 80 and 90 percent of the medical care, household maintenance,
transportation, and shopping needed by older persons;
Whereas families who give care to older persons face many additional expenses,
including the costs of home modifications, equipment rental, and additional
heating;
Whereas 80 percent of disabled elderly persons receive care from their family
members, most of whom are their wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law,
who often must sacrifice employment opportunities to provide such care;
Whereas the role of the aged spouse as a principal caregiver has generally
been understated;
Whereas family caregivers are often physically and emotionally exhausted
from the amount of time and stress involved in caregiving activities;
Whereas family caregivers need information about available community resources;
Whereas family caregivers need respite from the strains of their caregiving
roles;
Whereas the contributions of family caregivers help maintain strong family
ties and assure support among generations; and
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of and support for the
care that family caregivers are providing: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 19-25, 1989, is designated
 `National Family Caregivers Week', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States
 to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
