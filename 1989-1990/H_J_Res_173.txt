H.J.Res.173
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate April 16, 1989, and April 6, 1990, as `Education Day, U.S.A.'.
Whereas Congress recognizes the historical tradition of ethical values and
principles which are the basis of civilized society and upon which our great
Nation was founded;
Whereas these ethical values and principles have been the bedrock of society
from the dawn of civilization, when they were known as the Seven Noahide Laws;
Whereas without these ethical values and principles the edifice of civilization
stands in serious peril of returning to chaos;
Whereas society is profoundly concerned with the recent weakening of these
principles that has resulted in crises that beleaguer and threaten the fabric
of civilized society;
Whereas the justified preoccupation with these crises must not let the citizens
of this Nation lose sight of their responsibility to transmit these historical
ethical values from our distinguished past to the generations of the future;
Whereas the Lubavitch movement through its over one hundred and fifty centers
in the United States and many more the world over has fostered and promoted
these ethical values and principles throughout the world;
Whereas Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Lubavitch movement,
is universally respected and revered and his eighty-seventh year will be seen
as the year of continued `turn and return', the year in which we continue
to turn to an education which will return the world to the moral and ethical
values contained in the Seven Noahide Laws;
Whereas, this year of 1989 (5749 on the Hebrew calendar) is the `40th
Anniversary' in which the Rebbe completes the fourth decade since his
ascension to the world leadership of the Lubavitch movement and spiritual
guidance of world Jewry; and
Whereas this has been reflected in the `international scroll of honor'
which has been signed by the President of the United States and other heads
of state: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 16, 1989, the eighty-seventh
 birthday of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader and head of the
 worldwide Lubavitch movement, and April 6, 1990, are each designated as
 `Education Day, U.S.A.'. The President is requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe each such day with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities. We also call on heads of state of the
 world to join our President in this tribute by signing similar scrolls of
 honor which will be presented in their respective countries this year of the
 `40th Anniversary'. On this occasion we would also welcome the cooperation
 of the Department of State in extending the good office of the United States
 missions to the Lubavitcher emissaries.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
