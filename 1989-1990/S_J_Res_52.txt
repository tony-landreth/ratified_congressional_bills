One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To express gratitude for law enforcement personnel.
Whereas the first day of May of each year has been designated as `Law Day
U.S.A.' and set aside as a special day to advance equality and justice under
law, to encourage citizen support for law enforcement and law observance,
and to foster respect for law and an understanding of the essential place
of law in the life of every citizen of the United States;
Whereas each day police officers and other law enforcement personnel perform
their duties unflinchingly and without hesitation;
Whereas each year tens of thousands of law enforcement personnel are injured
or assaulted in the course of duty and many are killed;
Whereas law enforcement personnel are devoted to their jobs, are underpaid
for their efforts, and are tireless in their work; and
Whereas law enforcement personnel perform their duties without adequate
recognition: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That in celebration of `Law Day, U.S.A.',
 May 1, 1989, the grateful people of this Nation give special emphasis to
 all law enforcement personnel of the United States, and acknowledge the
 unflinching and devoted service law enforcement personnel perform as such
 personnel help preserve domestic tranquillity and guarantee the legal rights
 of all individuals of this Nation.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
