of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating May 13, 1990, as the `National Day in Support of Freedom and
Human Rights in China and Tibet'.
Whereas the United States supports the legitimate and democratic aspirations
for freedom of peoples throughout the world;
Whereas student and citizen groups throughout the world have taken great
risks in pursuit of reform;
Whereas on May 13, 1989, Chinese students began a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square seeking nonviolent dialogue with the Chinese Government;
Whereas the Chinese Government responded to the Chinese students with violence,
killing many;
Whereas the non-violent resistance of the people of Tibet to the Chinese
Government has also been met with violence;
Whereas the Chinese students and the Tibetan people follow the tradition
of the Dalai Lama's and Mahatma Gandhi's doctrine of non-violence, and have
inspired the world;
Whereas student organizations throughout the United States and around the
world have declared May 13, 1990, as an international day of fasting in
support of democratic reforms in China and Tibet; and
Whereas this effort is being undertaken in the hope of bringing the current
tragedies in China and Tibet to a peaceful end, and in the hope that productive
dialogue will replace an atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation designating May 13, 1990, as the
 `National Day in Support of Freedom and Human Rights in China and Tibet',
 and calling on the people of the United States to observe such a day with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
