One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of July 24 to July 30, 1989, as the `National Week of
Recognition and Remembrance for Those Who Served in the Korean War'.
Whereas on June 25, 1950, the Communist army of North Korea invaded and
attacked South Korea, initiating the Korean war;
Whereas the week of July 24 to July 30, 1989, includes July 27, the
thirty-sixth anniversary of the cease-fire agreement that ended the active
combat of the Korean war;
Whereas the Korean war was brought to an end primarily through the efforts
of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas for the first and only time in history a United Nations command
was created, with the United States as the executive agent, to repel this
invasion and preserve liberty for the people of the Republic of Korea;
Whereas, in addition to the United States and the Republic of Korea, twenty
other member nations provided military contingents to serve under the United
Nations banner;
Whereas, after three years of active hostilities, the territorial integrity
of the Republic of Korea was restored, and the freedom and independence of
its people are assured even to this date;
Whereas over five million seven hundred thousand American servicemen and
women were involved directly or indirectly in the war;
Whereas American casualties during that period were fifty-four thousand two
hundred and forty-six dead, of which thirty-three thousand six hundred and
twenty-nine were battle deaths, one hundred and three thousand two hundred
and eighty-four were wounded, eight thousand one hundred seventy-seven listed
as missing or prisoners of war, and three hundred and twenty-eight prisoners
of war are still unaccounted for;
Whereas, although the Korean war has been known as America's `Forgotten War',
those who served have never forgotten, and this Nation should never forget
the sacrifice made by those who fought and died in Korea for the noble and
just cause of freedom;
Whereas the Congress and the President of the United States have enacted a
law authorizing the establishment of a Korean War Veterans Memorial in the
Nation's Capital to recognize and honor the service and sacrifice of those
who participated in the Korean war;
Whereas increasing numbers of Korean war veterans are setting aside July 27,
the anniversary date of the armistice, as a special day to remember those
with whom they served and to honor those who made the supreme sacrifice in
a war to preserve the ideals of freedom and independence; and
Whereas on this significant anniversary of the cease-fire which started the
longest military armistice in modern history, it is right and appropriate
to recognize, honor, and remember the service and sacrifice of those who
endured the rigors of combat and the extremes of a hostile climate under the
most trying conditions and still prevailed to preserve the independence of
a free nation: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of July 24 to July 30, 1989, is
 designated as the `National Week of Recognition and Remembrance for Those Who
 Served in the Korean War'. The President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such
 week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to urge the departments
 and agencies of the United States and interested organizations, groups,
 and individuals to fly the American flag at half staff on July 27, 1989,
 in honor of those Americans who died as a result of their service in Korea.
