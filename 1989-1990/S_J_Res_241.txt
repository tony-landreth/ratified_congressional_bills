Joint Resolution
To designate the week of May 6, 1990 through May 13, 1990, as `Jewish Heritage
Week'.
Whereas May 10, 1990, marks the forty-second anniversary of the founding of
the State of Israel;
Whereas the months of April, May, and June contain events of major significance
in the Jewish calendar, including Passover, the anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising, Holocaust Memorial Day, and Jerusalem Day;
Whereas the Congress recognizes that an understanding of the heritage of
all ethnic groups in this Nation contributes to the unity of this Nation; and
Whereas understanding among ethnic groups in this Nation may be fostered
further through an appreciation of the culture, history, and traditions of
the Jewish community and the contributions of Jewish people to this Nation:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week of May 6, 1990 through May
 13, 1990, is designated as `Jewish Heritage Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States, departments and agencies of State and local governments,
 and interested organizations to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies,
 activities, and programs.
