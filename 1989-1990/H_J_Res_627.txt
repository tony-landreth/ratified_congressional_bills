Joint Resolution
Designating Labor Day weekend, September 1 through September 3, 1990, as
`National Drive for Life Weekend'.
Whereas drunk driving is the most frequently committed violent crime in the
United States, with arrests for driving while intoxicated totaling more than
3 times the number of arrests for all violent crimes combined;
Whereas 1 individual in the United States is killed every 22 minutes in a
drunk-driving-related crash, an average of 65 individuals each day;
Whereas more than 23,000 individuals were killed in the United States in
drunk-driving-related crashes in 1989;
Whereas 2 out of every 5 individuals in the United States will be involved
in a drunk-driving-related crash at some point in their lives;
Whereas the estimates of the economic costs of drunk driving in the United
States are as high as $24,000,000,000;
Whereas Americans are also asked to turn on their headlights while driving
on Drive for Life Day as a remembrance of those people killed or injured by
drunk-driving incidences;
Whereas Drive for Life is a public awareness campaign which asks all Americans
to pledge to be responsible by driving sober and encouraging others to do
the same on the Drive for Life Day and thereby demonstrating a commitment
to significantly reduce the tragedies of drunk driving and which serves to
educate the public about the dangers of drunk driving;
Whereas on the third annual National Drive for Life Day, the toll
of individuals killed in drunk-driving-related crashes in the United
States was 25.7 percent lower than the average number of deaths due to
drunk-driving-related crashes on Labor Day weekend Saturday, in 1988,
reflecting the success of this campaign;
Whereas the third annual National Drive for Life campaign featured endorsements
from all 50 United States Governors, more than 160 mayors, and all 50 State
police departments and other prominent public officials; and
Whereas the fourth annual National Drive for Life Day will occur on September
1, 1990, the Saturday of the Labor Day weekend, when drunk-driving-related
crashes are traditionally at their peak; Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the Labor Day weekend beginning on
 September 1, 1990, is designated as `National Drive for Life Weekend'. The
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on
 the people of the United States to observe that weekend with a pledge to
 not drink and drive and other appropriate activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
