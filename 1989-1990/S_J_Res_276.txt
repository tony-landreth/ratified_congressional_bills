Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning July 22, 1990, as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week'.
Whereas Lyme disease is spread by the tick species Ixodes Dammini by means
of the bacterium Borrelia Burgdorferi;
Whereas these ticks are no larger than the head of a pin;
Whereas these ticks can be carried by domestic animals such as cats, dogs,
and horses;
Whereas these ticks can be transferred from domestic animals to humans;
Whereas Lyme disease was first diagnosed in southeastern Connecticut and
has spread to 43 States;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control has reported more than 21,000 cases
of Lyme disease since 1982;
Whereas Lyme disease is easily treated in its early stages by an oral vaccine
administered by a physician (penicillin and erythromycin for young children
and tetracycline for persons allergic to penicillin);
Whereas the early symptoms of Lyme disease may be a bulls-eye rash, severe
headaches, fever, and swollen glands;
Whereas Lyme disease often mocks rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease;
Whereas if left untreated, Lyme disease can cause severe damage to the heart,
brain and joints;
Whereas the best cure for Lyme disease is prevention;
Whereas prevention of Lyme disease depends upon public awareness; and
Whereas education is essential to making the general public and health care
professionals more knowledgeable of Lyme disease and its debilitating side
effects: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning July 22, 1990,
 is designated as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
