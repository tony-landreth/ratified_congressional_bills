One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating November 16, 1989, as `Interstitial Cystitis Awareness Day'.
Whereas approximately 500,000 people in the United States suffer from
interstitial cystitis, which is an inflammation of the bladder wall;
Whereas 90 percent of the victims of interstitial cystitis are women;
Whereas a symptom of interstitial cystitis is an urgent need to urinate
(up to 60 times a day in severe cases);
Whereas interstitial cystitis is associated with intermittent or chronic
pain due to the inflammation of the bladder wall;
Whereas sometimes the pain resulting from interstitial cystitis is so great
it causes victims to take their own lives, though interstitial cystitis
itself is not fatal;
Whereas the estimated economic impact in 1988 of interstitial cystitis was
$1,700,000,000 in medical costs and lost productivity and wages;
Whereas prior to 1988, interstitial cystitis was an `orphan' disease and
ignored by Federal funding for research; and
Whereas the Federal Government should substantially increase the funding of
research of interstitial cystitis so that its funding is the same as other
urological diseases: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 16, 1989, is designated as
 `Interstitial Cystitis Awareness Day'. The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe that day by increasing their awareness of interstitial
 cystitis and participating in other appropriate activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
