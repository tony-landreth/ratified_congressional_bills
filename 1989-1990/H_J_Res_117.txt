One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To proclaim March 20, 1989, as `National Agriculture Day'.
Whereas agriculture is the Nation's largest and most basic industry, and its
associated production, processing, and marketing segments together provide
more jobs than any other single industry;
Whereas agriculture serves all Americans by providing food, fiber, and other
basic necessities of life;
Whereas the performance of the agricultural economy is vital to maintaining
the strength of our national economy, the standard of living of our citizens,
and our presence in world trade markets;
Whereas it is important that all Americans should understand the role that
agriculture plays in their lives and well-being whether they live in urban
or rural areas; and
Whereas since 1973, the first day of spring has been celebrated as National
Agriculture Day by farmers and ranchers, commodity and farm organizations,
cooperatives and agribusiness organizations, nonprofit and community
organizations, and Federal, State, and local governments: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That March 20, 1989, is hereby proclaimed
 `National Agriculture Day', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities during the week
 of March 19 through March 25, 1989.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
