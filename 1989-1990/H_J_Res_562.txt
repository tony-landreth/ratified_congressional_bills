Joint Resolution
Designating October 21 through 27, 1990 as `National Humanities Week'.
Whereas the study of the humanities increases the understanding of the great
traditions of civilization and of the intellectual heritage of individuals;
Whereas the identity of the population and the Nation is expressed through
the humanities;
Whereas the humanities help to break down the barriers of isolation and
allow individuals to talk to each other regardless of differences in race,
gender, or family experience;
Whereas the humanities help communities: evaluate the bonds of history and
place, console in sorrow, and experience joy, wonder, and laughter;
Whereas the State humanities have been a partnership between Federal, State,
and local government entities, universities, colleges, businesses, teachers,
scholars, and individuals;
Whereas designating a National Humanities Week brings together the public
and private sectors to restate support of the humanities: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 21 through 27, 1990, is
 designated as `National Humanities Week', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
