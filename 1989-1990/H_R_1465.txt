 (2) TREATED AS FACILITY FOR EXCESS LIABILITY- To the extent that removal
 costs and damages from any incident described in paragraph (1) exceed the
 amount for which a responsible party is liable (as that amount may be
 limited under subsection (a)(1)), the mobile offshore drilling unit is
 deemed to be an offshore facility. For purposes of applying subsection

  and environmental risks posed by the transportation of oil by vessel to
  deepwater ports (as defined in section 3 of the Deepwater Port Act of
  1974 (33 U.S.C. 1502)) versus the transportation of oil by vessel to other
  ports. The study shall include a review and analysis of offshore lightering
  practices used in connection with that transportation, an analysis of the
  volume of oil transported by vessel using those practices, and an analysis
  of the frequency and volume of oil discharges which occur in connection
  with the use of those practices.

  Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on the results
  of the study conducted under subparagraph (A).
  (C) RULEMAKING PROCEEDING- If the Secretary determines, based on the
  results of the study conducted under this subparagraph (A), that the use
  of deepwater ports in connection with the transportation of oil by vessel
  results in a lower operational or environmental risk than the use of other
  ports, the Secretary shall initiate, not later than the 180th day following
  the date of submission of the report to the Congress under subparagraph
  (B), a rulemaking proceeding to lower the limits of liability under this
  section for deepwater ports as the Secretary determines appropriate. The

Secretary's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion and
shall not impose additional civil penalties for the same violation unless
the Administrator's or Secretary's assessment of the penalty constitutes an
abuse of discretion.
  `(H) COLLECTION- If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil

the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in the first
sentence of this subparagraph shall be required to pay, in addition to such
amount and interest, attorneys fees and costs for collection proceedings and
a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which such failure
to pay persists. Such nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal to 20
percent of the aggregate amount of such person's penalties and nonpayment
penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.
  `(I) SUBPOENAS- The Administrator or Secretary, as the case may be, may

  the district court of the United States for any district in which such
  person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the
  United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to
  issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before

  `(8) DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT- In determining the amount of a civil penalty
  under paragraphs (6) and (7), the Administrator, Secretary, or the court,
  as the case may be, shall consider the seriousness of the violation or
  violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from
  the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for
  the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and
  degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate
  the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the
  violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
  `(9) MITIGATION OF DAMAGE- In addition to establishing a penalty for
  the discharge of oil or a hazardous substance, the Administrator or the
  Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may act
  to mitigate the damage to the public health or welfare caused by such
  discharge. The cost of such mitigation shall be deemed a cost incurred
  under subsection (c) of this section for the removal of such substance by
  the United States Government.
  `(10) RECOVERY OF REMOVAL COSTS- Any costs of removal incurred in connection
  with a discharge excluded by subsection (a)(2)(C) of this section shall

SEC. 5002. TERMINAL AND TANKER OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING.
  (a) SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS-
  (1) SHORT TITLE- This section may be cited as the `Oil Terminal and Oil
  Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990'.
  (2) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
  (A) the March 24, 1989, grounding and rupture of the fully loaded oil tanker,
  the EXXON VALDEZ, spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil in Prince William
  Sound, an environmentally sensitive area;
  (B) many people believe that complacency on the part of the industry
  and government personnel responsible for monitoring the operation of the
  Valdez terminal and vessel traffic in Prince William Sound was one of the
  contributing factors to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill;
  (C) one way to combat this complacency is to involve local citizens in
  the process of preparing, adopting, and revising oil spill contingency plans;
  (D) a mechanism should be established which fosters the long-term partnership
  of industry, government, and local communities in overseeing compliance
  with environmental concerns in the operation of crude oil terminals;
  (E) such a mechanism presently exists at the Sullom Voe terminal in the
  Shetland Islands and this terminal should serve as a model for others;
  (F) because of the effective partnership that has developed at Sullom Voe,
  Sullom Voe is considered the safest terminal in Europe;
  (G) the present system of regulation and oversight of crude oil terminals
  in the United States has degenerated into a process of continual mistrust
  and confrontation;
  (H) only when local citizens are involved in the process will the trust
  develop that is necessary to change the present system from confrontation
  to consensus;
  (I) a pilot program patterned after Sullom Voe should be established in
  Alaska to further refine the concepts and relationships involved; and
  (J) similar programs should eventually be established in other major crude
  oil terminals in the United States because the recent oil spills in Texas,
  Delaware, and Rhode Island indicate that the safe transportation of crude
  oil is a national problem.
  (b) DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS-
  (1) ESTABLISHMENT- There are established 2 Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker
  Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Demonstration Programs (hereinafter
  referred to as `Programs') to be carried out in the State of Alaska.
  (2) ADVISORY FUNCTION- The function of these Programs shall be advisory only.
  (3) PURPOSE- The Prince William Sound Program shall be responsible for

  and the crude oil tankers operating in Prince William Sound. The Cook Inlet
  Program shall be responsible for environmental monitoring of the terminal
  facilities and crude oil tankers operating in Cook Inlet located South
  of the latitude at Point Possession and North of the latitude at Amatuli
  Island, including offshore facilities in Cook Inlet.
  (4) SUITS BARRED- No program, association, council, committee or other
  organization created by this section may sue any person or entity, public
  or private, concerning any matter arising under this section except for
  the performance of contracts.

  crude oil tankers calling at the terminal facilities and shall represent
  those owners and operators.
  (C) One individual shall be an employee of the State of Alaska, shall be
  designated by the Governor of the State of Alaska, and shall represent
  the State government.
  (D) One individual shall be an employee of the Federal Government, shall
  be designated by the President, and shall represent the Federal Government.
  (3) RESPONSIBILITIES- Each Association shall be responsible for reviewing
  policies relating to the operation and maintenance of the oil terminal
  facilities and crude oil tankers which affect or may affect the environment
  in the vicinity of their respective terminals. Each Association shall provide
  a forum among the owners and operators of the terminal facilities, the owners
  and operators of crude oil tankers calling at those facilities, the United
  States, and the State of Alaska to discuss and to make recommendations
  concerning all permits, plans, and site-specific regulations governing
  the activities and actions of the terminal facilities which affect or may
  affect the environment in the vicinity of the terminal facilities and of
  crude oil tankers calling at those facilities.
  (4) DESIGNATION OF EXISTING ORGANIZATION- The Secretary may designate an

  fragility and beauty;
  (2) the annual economic benefits of commercial and recreational fishing
  activities to North Carolina, which could be adversely affected by oil or
  gas development offshore the State's coast, exceeds $1,000,000,000;
  (3) the major industry in coastal North Carolina is tourism, which is subject
  to potentially significant disruption by offshore oil or gas development;
  (4) the physical oceanographic characteristics of the area offshore North
  Carolina between Cape Hatteras and the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay are not
  well understood, being affected by Gulf Stream western boundary perturbations
  and accompanying warm filaments, warm and cold core rings which separate
  from the Gulf Stream, wind stress, outflow from the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf
  Stream meanders, and intrusions of Virginia coastal waters around and over
  the Diamond shoals;
  (5) diverse and abundant fisheries resources occur in the western boundary
  area of the Gulf Stream offshore North Carolina, but little is understood
  of the complex ecological relationships between the life histories of
  those species and their physical, chemical, and biological environment;
  (6) the environmental impact statements prepared for Outer Continental
  Shelf lease sales numbered 56 (1981) and 78 (1983) contain insufficient and
  outdated environmental information from which to make decisions on approval
  of additional oil and gas leasing, exploration, and development activities;
  (7) the draft environmental report, dated November 1, 1989, and the
  preliminary final environmental report dated June 1, 1990, prepared pursuant
  to a July 14, 1989 memorandum of understanding between the State of North
  Carolina, the Department of the Interior, and the Mobil Oil Company, have
  not allayed concerns about the adequacy of the environmental information
  available to determine whether to proceed with additional offshore leasing,
  exploration, or development offshore North Carolina; and
  (8) the National Research Council report entitled `The Adequacy of
  Environmental Information for Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Decisions:
  Florida and California', issued in 1989, concluded that--
  (A) information with respect to those States, which have received greater
  scrutiny than has North Carolina, is inadequate; and
  (B) there are serious generic defects in the Minerals Management Service's
  methods of environmental analysis,
reinforcing concerns about the adequacy of the scientific and technical
information which are the basis for a decision to lease additional tracts or
approve an exploration plan offshore North Carolina, especially with respect
to oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic information.
  (c) PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING, EXPLORATION, AND DEVELOPMENT-
  (1) PROHIBITION- The Secretary of the Interior shall not--
  (A) conduct a lease sale;

  (2) BOUNDARIES- For purposes of paragraph (1), the term `offshore North
  Carolina' means the area within the lateral seaward boundaries between
  areas offshore North Carolina and areas offshore--
  (A) Virginia as provided in the joint resolution entitled `Joint resolution
  granting the consent of Congress to an agreement between the States of
  North Carolina and Virginia establishing their lateral seaward boundary'
  approved October 27, 1972 (86 Stat. 1298); and
  (B) South Carolina as provided in the Act entitled `An Act granting the
  consent of Congress to the agreement between the States of North Carolina
  and South Carolina establishing their lateral seaward boundary' approved
  October 9, 1981 (95 Stat. 988).
  (3) DURATION OF PROHIBITION-
  (A) IN GENERAL- The prohibition under paragraph (1) shall remain in effect
  until the later of--
  (i) October 1, 1991; or
  (ii) 45 days of continuous session of the Congress after submission of a
  written report to the Congress by the Secretary of the Interior, made after
  consideration of the findings and recommendations of the Environmental
  Sciences Review Panel under subsection (e)--
  (I) certifying that the information available, including information acquired
  pursuant to subsection (d), is sufficient to enable the Secretary to carry
  out his responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act with
  respect to authorizing the activities described in paragraph (1); and
  (II) including a detailed explanation of any differences between such
  certification and the findings and recommendations of the Environmental
  Sciences Review Panel under subsection (e), and a detailed justification
  of each such difference.
