S.J.Res.110
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating October 5, 1989, as `Raoul Wallenberg Day'.
Whereas in January 1944, the United States War Refugee Board asked Sweden
to send a representative to Hungary to organize rescue operations for the
Hungarian Jewish community which was marked for liquidation by the Nazis;
Whereas the Swedish representative, Raoul Wallenberg, through a combination
of what has been described as `bluff, heroism, and a contempt for convention'
waged a bold campaign in Hungary to thwart the `final solution';
Whereas in the 6 months he was in Budapest, Raoul Wallenberg managed to,
directly and indirectly, save the lives of some 100,000 men, women, and
children;
Whereas Raoul Wallenberg risked his own life countless times during his work,
dragging Jews from trains bound for gas chambers, bringing food and blankets
to those on death marches, and unflinchingly challenging Nazi authorities;
Whereas Raoul Wallenberg was taken into Soviet `protective custody' on January
13, 1945, in violation of international standards of diplomatic immunity;
Whereas Soviet officials originally denied having custody of Wallenberg,
but subsequently stated that a prisoner named `Wallenberg' died in a Soviet
prison on July 17, 1947;
Whereas eyewitness accounts over the years, and as recently as December 1986,
indicate that Raoul Wallenberg may indeed still be alive and imprisoned in
the Soviet Union;
Whereas the Soviet Union has never produced a death certificate or the
remains of Raoul Wallenberg to prove that he died;
Whereas the Soviet Union, despite numerous attempts by Swedish and American
officials, refuses to look into the reports that Raoul Wallenberg is still
alive;
Whereas just as Raoul Wallenberg did not forget the Jewish people when it
seemed that the rest of the world had forgotten, Raoul Wallenberg and all
that he did for the cause of humanity must never be forgotten; and
Whereas on October 5, 1981, the President of the United States signed into
law a proclamation making Raoul Wallenberg an honorary citizen of the United
States: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 5, 1989, is designated as
 `Raoul Wallenberg Recognition Day', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe such a day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
