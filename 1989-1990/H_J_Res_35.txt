H.J.Res.35
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating November 5-11, 1989, as `National Women Veterans Recognition
Week'.
Whereas there are more than 1,200,000 women veterans in the Nation,
representing 4.2 percent of the total veteran population;
Whereas the number of women serving in the Armed Forces and the number of
women veterans continue to increase;
Whereas women veterans have contributed greatly to the Nation's security
through honorable military service which in many cases involved great hardship
and danger;
Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of women veterans on behalf of the
Nation deserve greater public recognition and appreciation;
Whereas the special needs of women veterans, especially in the area of
health care, have often been overlooked or inadequately addressed by the
Federal Government;
Whereas this lack of attention to the special needs of women veterans has
discouraged or prevented many women veterans from taking full advantage of
the benefits and services to which they are entitled; and
Whereas designating a week to recognize women veterans in November 1989 will
help further important gains made by women veterans following National Women
Veterans Recognition Week in November 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That November 5-11, 1989, is designated as
 `National Women Veterans Recognition Week', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the
 United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
