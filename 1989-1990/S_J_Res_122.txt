S.J.Res.122
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate October 1989 and 1990 as `National Down Syndrome Month'.
Whereas the past two decades have brought a greater and more enlightened
attitude in the care and training of the developmentally disabled;
Whereas one such condition which has undergone considerable reevaluation is
that of Down syndrome--a condition which, just a short time ago, was often
stigmatized as a mentally retarded condition which relegated its victims to
lives of passivity in institutions and back rooms;
Whereas through the efforts of concerned physicians, teachers and parent
groups such as the National Down Syndrome Congress, programs are being put
in place to educate new parents of babies with Down syndrome, to develop
special education classes within mainstream programs in schools, to provide for
vocational training in preparation for entering the work force, and to prepare
young adults with Down syndrome for independent living in the community;
Whereas the cost of such services designed to help individuals with Down
syndrome move into their rightful place in our society is but a tiny fraction
of the cost of institutionalization;
Whereas not only the improvement in educational opportunities for those with
Down syndrome, but also the advancement in medical science is adding to a
brighter outlook for individuals born with this chromosomal configuration; and
Whereas public awareness and acceptance of the capabilities of children with
Down syndrome can greatly facilitate their being mainstreamed in our society:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1989 and 1990 are designated as
 `National Down Syndrome Month' and that the President of the United States is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe the designated month with appropriate programs,
 ceremonies, and activities.
