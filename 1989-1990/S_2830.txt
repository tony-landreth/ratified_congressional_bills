 than $10.10 per hundredweight for milk containing 3.67 percent milkfat.
 `(c) Purchases-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- The price of milk shall be supported through the purchase
 of milk and the products of milk.

 all of that product sold by persons offering to sell the product to the
 Corporation. The purchase prices shall be sufficient to enable plants of
 average efficiency to pay producers, on average, a price not less than the
 rate of price support for milk in effect during a 12-month period under
 this subsection.
 `(3) Butter and nonfat dry milk-
 `(A) ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICES- The Secretary may allocate the rate of
 price support between the purchase prices for nonfat dry milk and butter in a
 manner that will result in the lowest level of expenditures by the Commodity
 Credit Corporation or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary considers
 appropriate. The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of
 the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,
 and Forestry of the Senate of the allocation.
 `(B) TIMING OF PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary may make any

 `(d) Support Rate Adjustments-
 `(1) Reductions-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Effective January 1 of each of the calendar years 1991
 through 1995, if the level of purchases of milk and the products of milk by
 the Commodity Credit Corporation under this section (less sales under section
 407 for unrestricted use), as estimated by the Secretary by November 20 of
 the preceding calendar year, will exceed 5 billion pounds (milk equivalent,
 total milk solids basis), the Secretary shall decrease by an amount per
 hundredweight of at least $0.25 but not more than $0.50 the rate of price
 support for milk in effect for the calendar year.
 `(B) PRIOR NOTIFICATION- The Secretary shall, by November 20 of the
 preceding calendar year, notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House
 of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry

 of the preceding calendar year, will not exceed 3.5 billion pounds (milk
 equivalent, total milk solids basis), the Secretary shall increase by an
 amount per hundredweight of at least $0.25 the rate of price support for
 milk in effect for the calendar year.
 `(B) PRIOR NOTIFICATION- The Secretary shall, by November 20 of the
 preceding calendar year, notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House
 of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
 of the Senate of any proposed increase in price support under this paragraph.
 `(3) NO ADJUSTMENTS- If for any of the calendar years 1992 through 1995,
 the level of purchases of milk and the products of milk by the Commodity
 Credit Corporation under this section (less sales under section 407 for
 unrestricted use), as estimated by the Secretary by November 20 of the
 preceding calendar year, will be less than 5 billion pounds (milk equivalent,
 total milk solids basis), but more than 3.5 billion pounds (milk equivalent,
 total milk solids basis), the Secretary shall not decrease the rate of
 price support for milk in effect for the calendar year.
 `(4) MINIMUM PRICE- Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
 in no event shall the price of milk be supported at less than $10.10 per
 hundredweight.
 `(5) Administration-
 `(A) MILK EQUIVALENT, TOTAL MILK SOLIDS BASIS- As used in this section, the
 term `milk equivalent, total milk solids basis', of milk and the products
 of milk purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation, shall be equal
 to the weighted-average of the milk equivalent (as computed on a milkfat
 basis and on a milk solids nonfat basis) of such products, with weighting
 factors equal to not more than 40 percent for the milk equivalent, milkfat
 basis, and not more than 70 percent for the milk equivalent, solids nonfat
 basis. The weighting factors shall total 100 percent.
 `(B) LEVEL OF PURCHASES- In estimating the level of purchases of milk and
 the products of milk under this section, the Secretary shall deduct the
 amount, if any, by which the level of imports into the United States of
 milk and the products of milk during the most recent calendar year exceeds
 the annual average level of imports into the United States of milk and the
 products of milk during the period January 1, 1986, through December 31,
 1990 (milk equivalent, total milk solids basis).
 `(e) REPORT ON MILK INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- Not later than August 1, 1991, the Secretary shall prepare
 and submit a report and recommendations on various milk inventory management
 programs to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives

 `(2) SOLICITATION OF PROPOSALS- Within 60 days after the date of enactment
 of this section, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a
 notice to solicit proposals concerning a milk inventory management program.
 `(3) REQUIRED PROPOSALS- In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary
 shall study, among other proposals--
 `(A) an alternative classification of milk contained in section 8c(5)
 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 608c(5)), as amended by the
 Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937;
 `(B) a program to support the income of milk producers through a system of
 established prices and deficiency payments; and
 `(C) other such programs submitted to the Secretary under paragraph (2)
 as the Secretary may determine appropriate after consultation with the
 Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee
 on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.
 `(4) PROHIBITED PROGRAMS- In the study required under paragraph (3), the
 Secretary shall not consider any milk inventory management program that
 includes any milk production termination program that is similar to the
 program established under section 201(d)(3), or support price reductions
 below the levels established under this section.
 `(5) CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION- The Secretary shall evaluate the proposals
 for a milk inventory management program based on--
 `(A) the ability of the program to limit Government purchases of milk
 products to 6,000,000,000 pounds (milk equivalent, total milk solids basis)
 in a calendar year;
 `(B) the speed and effectiveness of reducing excess milk production;
 `(C) the effectiveness in sustaining reduced milk production for at least
 a 5-year period with and without the continuation of the program;
 `(D) the regional impact on milk prices, producer revenue, and milk supplies;
 `(E) the impact on national producer income and Government expenditures;
 `(F) the impact on the rural economy and maintaining family farms;
 `(G) the impact on the availability of wholesome dairy products for domestic
 and foreign nutrition and food assistance programs;
 `(H) technological innovations;
 `(I) the effectiveness in reducing butter fat production and increasing

 1 and by November 20 of each of the calendar years 1991 through 1995,
 the Secretary shall notify the Committee on Agriculture of the House of
 Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
 of the Senate regarding the value and volume of dairy product purchases on
 a milk equivalent, total milk solids basis, the Secretary estimates that
 the Corporation will make during the upcoming calendar year.
 `(g) Excess Purchases-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- In order to offset any cost to the Commodity Credit
 Corporation associated with the purchase of milk and the products of milk in
 excess of 7,000,000,000 pounds (milk equivalent, total milk solids basis),
 during any of the calendar years 1991 through 1994, the Secretary shall,
 if necessary, provide for a reduction to be made in the price received
 by producers for all milk produced in the United States and marketed by
 producers for commercial use.
 `(2) CALCULATION- If on November 20 of each of the calendar years 1991 through
 1994, the Secretary estimates that the level of Commodity Credit Corporation
 purchases of milk and the products of milk will exceed 7,000,000,000 pounds
 (milk equivalent, total milk solids basis), the amount of reduction in the
 price received by producers shall be an amount per hundredweight calculated
 by dividing--
 `(A) the cost of the purchases in excess of 7,000,000,000 pounds, milk
 equivalent, total milk solids basis; by
 `(B) the total quantity of hundredweights of milk the Secretary estimates
 will be produced and marketed in the United States for commercial use in
 that calendar year.
 `(3) ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary shall adjust any such assessment in future
 years, or refund any portion of such assessments, as needed, to carry out
 the purposes of this subsection.
 `(h) USE OF COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION- The Secretary shall use the funds,
 facilities, and authorities of the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry
 out this section.
 `(i) PERIOD- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section

 and ending on December 31, 1995.'.
 (b) CONFORMING PROVISION- Section 553 of title 5, United States Code,
 shall not apply with respect to the implementation of section 204 of the
 Agricultural Act of 1949 (as added by subsection (a) of this section)
 by the Secretary of Agriculture, including determinations made regarding--
 (1) the level of price support for milk; and
 (2) any reduction in the prices paid to producers of milk.
SEC. 102. MILK MANUFACTURING MARKETING ADJUSTMENT.
 (a) IN GENERAL- Effective beginning on the date that is 12 months after the
 date of enactment of this Act, no State shall provide for (and no person shall
 collect, directly or indirectly) a greater allowance for the processing of
 milk (hereafter referred to as a `make allowance') than is permitted under
 a Federal program to establish a Grade A price for manufacturing butter,
 nonfat dry milk, or cheese.
 (b) LIABILITY FOR PENALTIES-
 (1) IN GENERAL- If the Secretary of Agriculture determines that--
 (A) based on a request by a producer supported by evidence, the make allowance
 collected by a person is in excess of the amount that is permitted under
 subsection (a); or
 (B) a person has failed to comply with any requirement of this section or
 a regulation issued under this section,
the person shall be liable for penalties as determined by the Commodity
Credit Corporation in accordance with this subsection.
 (2) AMOUNT OF PENALTIES- Such penalties shall be equal to the product
 obtained by multiplying--
 (A) twice the permitted make allowance that could be charged as provided
 under subsection (a); by
 (B) the quantity of milk with respect to which the person was determined by
 the Secretary to have collected a make allowance in excess of the permitted

 `(1) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
 Secretary shall make available to producers on a farm loans and purchases
 for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat produced on the farm at such
 level as the Secretary determines will maintain the competitive relationship
 of wheat to other grains in domestic and export markets after taking into
 consideration the cost of producing wheat, supply and demand conditions,
 and world prices for wheat.
 `(2) MINIMUM LOAN AND PURCHASE LEVEL- Except as provided in paragraphs
 (3) and (4), the loan and purchase level determined under paragraph (1)
 shall not be less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by
 producers of wheat, as determined by the Secretary, during the marketing
 years for the immediately preceding 5 crops of wheat, excluding the year in
 which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average
 price was the lowest in such period, except that the loan and purchase level
 for a crop determined under this paragraph may not be reduced by more than
 5 percent from the level determined for the preceding crop.
 `(3) ADJUSTMENTS TO SUPPORT LEVEL-
 `(A) STOCKS TO USE RATIO- If the Secretary estimates for any marketing year
 that the ratio of ending stocks of wheat to total use for the marketing
 year will be--
 `(i) equal to or greater than 30 percent, the Secretary may reduce the loan
 and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by an amount not
 to exceed 10 percent in any year;
 `(ii) less than 30 percent but not less than 15 percent, the Secretary may
 reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop by
 an amount not to exceed 5 percent in any year; or
 `(iii) less than 15 percent, the Secretary may not reduce the loan and
 purchase level for wheat for the corresponding crop.
 `(B) REPORT TO CONGRESS-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- If the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for
 wheat under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on
 Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture,
 Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate a report--
 `(I) certifying such adjustment as necessary to prevent the accumulation
 of stocks and to retain market share; and
 `(II) containing a description of the need for such adjustment.
 `(ii) EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADJUSTMENT- The adjustment shall become effective
 no earlier than 60 calendar days after the date of submission of the report
 to the Committees, except that in the case of the 1991 crop of wheat, the
 adjustment shall become effective on the date of the submission of the report.
 `(C) COMPETITIVE POSITION- Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the Secretary
 determines, not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of a marketing
 year for a crop, that the effective loan rate established for such crop
 will not maintain a competitive market position for wheat, the Secretary
 may reduce the loan and purchase level for wheat for the marketing year
 by an amount, in addition to any reduction under subparagraph (A), not to
 exceed 10 percent in any year.
 `(D) NO EFFECT ON FUTURE YEARS- Any reduction in the loan and purchase level
 for wheat under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining the
 loan and purchase level for wheat for subsequent years.
 `(E) MINIMUM LOAN RATE- Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the loan rate
 for wheat shall not be less than $2.44 per bushel, unless such rate would
 exceed 80 percent of the 5-year average market price determination.
 `(4) Marketing loan provisions-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan
 made under this subsection for a crop at a level (except as provided in
 subparagraph (C)) that is the lesser of--
 `(i) the loan level determined for the crop;
 `(ii) the higher of--
 `(I) 70 percent of such level;
 `(II) if the loan level for a crop was reduced under paragraph (3),
 70 percent of the loan level that would have been in effect but for the
 reduction under paragraph (3); or
 `(iii) the prevailing world market price for wheat (adjusted to United
 States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary.
 `(B) PREVAILING WORLD MARKET PRICE- If the Secretary permits a producer
 to repay a loan in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall
 prescribe by regulation--
 `(i) a formula to determine the prevailing world market price for wheat,
 adjusted to United States quality and location; and
 `(ii) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the
 prevailing world market price for wheat.
 `(C) ALTERNATIVE REPAYMENT RATES- For each of the 1991 through 1995 crops
 of wheat, if the world market price for wheat (adjusted to United States
 quality and location) as determined by the Secretary, is less than the loan
 level determined for the crop, the Secretary may permit a producer to repay
 a loan made under this subsection for a crop at such level (not in excess
 of the loan level determined for the crop) as the Secretary determines will--
 `(i) minimize potential loan forfeitures;
 `(ii) minimize the accumulation of wheat stocks by the Federal Government;
 `(iii) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing
 wheat; and
 `(iv) allow wheat produced in the United States to be marketed freely and
 competitively, both domestically and internationally.

 time of the determination.
 `(b) Loan Deficiency Payments-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may, for each of the 1991 through 1995
 crops of wheat, make payments (hereafter in this section referred to as
 `loan deficiency payments') available to producers who, although eligible
 to obtain a loan or purchase agreement under subsection (a), agree to forgo
 obtaining the loan or agreement in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(2) COMPUTATION- A payment under this subsection shall be computed by
 multiplying--
 `(A) the loan payment rate; by
 `(B) the quantity of wheat the producer is eligible to place under loan (or
 obtain a purchase agreement) but for which the producer forgoes obtaining
 the loan or agreement in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(3) LOAN PAYMENT RATE- For purposes of this subsection, the loan payment
 rate shall be the amount by which--
 `(A) the loan level determined for the crop under subsection (a); exceeds
 `(B) the level at which a loan may be repaid under subsection (a).
 `(c) Payments-
 `(1) Deficiency payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall make available to producers payments
 (hereafter in this section referred to as `deficiency payments') for each
 of the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat in an amount computed by multiplying--
 `(i) the payment rate; by
 `(ii) the payment acres for the crop; by
 `(iii) the farm program payment yield established for the crop for the farm.
 `(B) Payment rate-
 `(i) PAYMENT RATE FOR 1991 THROUGH 1993 CROPS- The payment rate for each
 of the 1991 through 1993 crops of wheat shall be the amount by which the

 the first 5 months of the marketing year for the crop, as determined by
 the Secretary; or
 `(II) the loan level determined for the crop, prior to any adjustment made
 under subsection (a)(3) for the marketing year for the crop of wheat.
 `(ii) PAYMENT RATE OF 1994 AND 1995 CROPS- The payment rate for each of the
 1994 and 1995 crops of wheat shall be calculated as provided in clause (i).
 `(iii) MINIMUM ESTABLISHED PRICE- The established price for wheat shall
 not be less than $4.00 per bushel for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops.
 `(C) PAYMENT ACRES- Payment acres for a crop shall be the lesser of--
 `(i) the number of acres planted to the crop for harvest within the permitted
 acreage; or
 `(ii) 100 percent of the crop acreage base for the crop for the farm less
 the quantity of reduced acreage (as determined under subsection (e)(2)(D)).
 `(D) Emergency compensation-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section,
 if the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for wheat under
 subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall provide emergency compensation by
 increasing the deficiency payments for wheat by such amount as the Secretary
 determines necessary to provide the same total return to producers as if
 the adjustment in the level of loans and purchases had not been made.
 `(ii) CALCULATION- In determining the payment rate, per bushel, for emergency
 compensation payments for a crop of wheat under this subparagraph, the
 Secretary shall use the national weighted average market price, per bushel
 of wheat, received by producers during the marketing year for the crop,
 as determined by the Secretary.
 `(iii) DEADLINES FOR ESTIMATES AND AVAILABILITY- Notwithstanding any other
 provision of this Act, the Secretary shall--
 `(I) by December 1 of the marketing year for the crop, estimate the national
 weighted average market price, per bushel of wheat, received by producers
 during the marketing year;
 `(II) by December 15 of the marketing year, use the estimate to make
 available to producers who have elected the payment option authorized by
 this clause not less than 75 percent of the increase in payments estimated
 to be payable with respect to the crop under this subparagraph; and
 `(III) adjust the amount of each final payment for wheat to reflect any
 difference between the amount of any estimated payment made under this
 clause and the amount of actual payment due under this subparagraph.
 `(iv) TIME FOR ELECTING PAYMENT OPTION- Producers shall elect the payment
 option authorized by clause (iii) at the time of entering into a contract
 to participate in the program established by this section for the crop.
 `(E) 0/92 program-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- If an acreage limitation program under subsection (e)(2) is
 in effect for a crop of wheat and the producers on a farm devote a portion of
 the maximum payment acres for wheat as calculated under subparagraph (C)(ii)
 of the farm equal to more than 8 percent of such wheat acreage of the farm
 for the crop to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (F))--
 `(I) such portion of the maximum payment acres in excess of 8 percent of such
 acreage devoted to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (F))
 shall be considered to be planted to wheat for the purpose of determining
 the acreage on the farm required to be devoted to conservation uses in
 accordance with subsection (e)(2)(D); and
 `(II) the producers shall be eligible for payments under this paragraph
 with respect to such acreage.
 `(ii) DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
 section, any producer who devotes a portion of the maximum payment acres
 for wheat for the farm to conservation uses (or other uses as provided in
 subparagraph (F)) under this subparagraph shall receive deficiency payments
 on the acreage that is considered to be planted to wheat and eligible for
 payments under this subparagraph for the crop at a per-bushel rate established
 by the Secretary, except that the rate may not be established at less than
 the projected deficiency payment rate for the crop, as determined by the
 Secretary. Such projected payment rate for the crop shall be announced by
 the Secretary prior to the period during which wheat producers may agree
 to participate in the program for the crop.
 `(iii) ADVERSE EFFECT ON AGRIBUSINESS AND OTHER INTERESTS- The Secretary
 shall implement this subparagraph in such a manner as to minimize the adverse
 effect on agribusiness and other agriculturally related economic interests
 within any county, State, or region. In carrying out this subparagraph,
 the Secretary is authorized to restrict the total quantity of wheat acreage
 that may be taken out of production under this subparagraph, taking into
 consideration the total quantity of acreage that has or will be removed from
 production under other price support, production adjustment, or conservation
 program activities. No restrictions on the quantity of acreage that may be
 taken out of production in accordance with this subparagraph in a crop year
 shall be imposed in the case of a county in which producers were eligible
 to receive disaster emergency loans under section 321 of the Consolidated
 Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961) as a result of a disaster
 that occurred during the crop year.
 `(iv) CROP ACREAGE AND PAYMENT YIELD- The wheat crop acreage base and
 wheat farm program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced due to
 the fact that a portion of the permitted wheat acreage of the farm was
 devoted to conserving uses (except as provided in subparagraph (F)) under
 this subparagraph.
 `(v) LIMITATION- Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (iv),
 payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater
 acreage than the acreage actually planted to wheat.
 `(vi) CONSERVATION USE ACREAGE UNDER OTHER PROGRAMS- Any acreage considered
 to be planted to wheat in accordance with clauses (i) and (iv) may not also
 be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any
 provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program requiring
 that the producers devote a specified acreage to conservation uses.
 `(F) Alternative crops-
 `(i) INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such
 terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of
 acreage otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition
 of qualifying for payments under subparagraph (E) to be devoted to sweet
 sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe, plantago ovato, triticale,
 rye, mung beans, commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw material being imported,
 or likely to be imported, into the United States, or commodities grown
 for experimental purposes (including kenaf and milkweed), subject to the
 following sentence. The Secretary may permit the acreage to be devoted to
 the production only if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) the production is not likely to increase the cost of the price support
 program and will not affect farm income adversely; and
 `(II) the production is needed to provide an adequate supply of the commodity,
 or, in the case of commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw materials, the production
 is needed to encourage domestic manufacture of the raw material and could
 lead to increased industrial use of the raw material to the long-term
 benefit of United States industry.
 `(ii) OILSEEDS- The Secretary shall permit, subject to such terms and
 conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of acreage
 otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition of
 qualifying for payments under subparagraph (E) to be devoted to sunflowers,
 rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, and other minor oilseed
 designated by the Secretary (excluding soybeans). In implementing this
 clause, the Secretary shall provide that, in order to receive payments under
 subparagraph (E), the producers shall agree to forgo eligibility to receive a
 loan under section 205 for the crop of any such oilseed produced on the farm.
 `(G) REDUCTION FOR DISASTER PAYMENTS- The total quantity of wheat on which
 payments would otherwise be payable to a producer on a farm for any crop
 under this paragraph shall be reduced by the quantity on which any disaster
 payment is made to the producer for the crop under paragraph (2).
 `(2) Disaster payments-
 `(A) PREVENTED PLANTING- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the
 Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from
 planting any portion of the acreage intended for wheat to wheat or other
 nonconserving crops because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster,
 or other condition beyond the control of the producers, the Secretary shall
 make a prevented planting disaster payment to the producers in an amount
 equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
 `(i) the number of acres so affected but not to exceed the acreage planted
 to wheat for harvest (including any acreage that the producers were prevented
 from planting to wheat or other nonconserving crops in lieu of wheat because
 of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond
 the control of the producers) in the immediately preceding year; by
 `(ii) 75 percent of the farm program payment yield established for the farm
 by the Secretary; by
 `(iii) a payment rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price
 for the crop.
 `(B) REDUCED YIELDS- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the Secretary
 determines that because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the total quantity of wheat
 that the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less than the result
 of multiplying 60 percent of the farm program payment yield established by
 the Secretary for the crop by the acreage planted for harvest for the crop,
 the Secretary shall make a reduced yield disaster payment to the producers
 at a rate equal to 50 percent of the established price for the crop for
 the deficiency in production below 60 percent for the crop.
 `(C) CROP INSURANCE- Producers on a farm shall not be eligible for--
 `(i) prevented planting disaster payments under subparagraph (A), if prevented
 planting crop insurance is available to the producers under the Federal Crop
 Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) with respect to the wheat acreage of
 the producers; or
 `(ii) reduced yield disaster payments under subparagraph (B), if reduced
 yield crop insurance is available to the producers under such Act with
 respect to the wheat acreage of the producers.
 `(D) Administration-
 `(i) ECONOMIC EMERGENCIES- Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), the Secretary
 may make a disaster payment to the producers on a farm under this paragraph
 if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) as the result of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the producers have suffered
 substantial losses of production either from being prevented from planting
 wheat or other nonconserving crops or from reduced yields;
 `(II) the losses have created an economic emergency for the producers;
 `(III) crop insurance indemnity payments under the Federal Crop Insurance
 Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and other forms of assistance made available
 by the Federal Government to the producers for the losses are insufficient
 to alleviate the economic emergency; and
 `(IV) additional assistance must be made available to the producers to
 alleviate the economic emergency.
 `(ii) ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary may make such adjustments in the amount of
 payments made available under this paragraph with respect to an individual
 farm as necessary to ensure the equitable allotment of the payments among
 producers, taking into account other forms of Federal disaster assistance
 provided to the producers for the crop involved.
 `(d) PAYMENT YIELDS- The farm program payment yields for farms for each
 crop of wheat shall be determined under title V.
 `(e) Acreage Reduction Programs-
 `(1) In general-
 `(A) ESTABLISHMENT- Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if the
 Secretary determines that the total supply of wheat, in the absence of an
 acreage limitation program, will be excessive taking into account the need
 for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and
 prices and to meet a national emergency, the Secretary may provide for any
 crop of wheat an acreage limitation program as described in paragraph (2).
 `(B) AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM- In making a determination
 under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into consideration the
 number of acres placed in the agricultural resources conservation program
 established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985
 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et seq.).
 `(C) ANNOUNCEMENTS- If the Secretary elects to implement an acreage limitation
 program for any crop year, the Secretary shall announce any such program not
 later than June 1 prior to the calendar year in which the crop is harvested,
 except that in the case of the 1991 crop, the Secretary shall announce the
 program as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this section.
 `(D) ADJUSTMENTS- Not later than July 31 of the year previous to the year
 in which the crop is harvested, the Secretary may make adjustments in the
 program announced under subparagraph (C) if the Secretary determines that
 there has been a significant change in the total supply of wheat since the
 program was first announced.
 `(E) COMPLIANCE- As a condition of eligibility for loans, purchases, and
 payments for any such crop of wheat, except as provided in subsections
 (f) and (g) and section 504, the producers on a farm must comply with the
 terms and conditions of the acreage limitation program and, if applicable,
 a land diversion program as provided in paragraph (5).
 `(F) ACREAGE LIMITATION PROGRAM FOR 1991 CROP- In the case of the 1991 crop
 of wheat, the Secretary shall provide for an acreage limitation program
 (as described in paragraph (2)) under which the acreage planted to wheat
 for harvest on a farm would be limited to the wheat crop acreage base for
 the farm for the crop reduced by not less than 15 percent.
 `(G) ACREAGE LIMITATION PROGRAMS FOR 1992 THROUGH 1995 CROPS- In the case
 of each of the 1992 through 1995 crops of wheat, if the Secretary estimates
 for a marketing year for the crop that the ratio of ending stocks of wheat
 to total disappearance of wheat for the preceding marketing year will be--
 `(i) more than 40 percent, the Secretary shall provide for an acreage
 limitation program (as described in paragraph (2)) under which the acreage
 planted to wheat for harvest on a farm would be limited to the wheat crop
 acreage base for the farm for the crop reduced by not less than 10 percent
 nor more than 20 percent; or
 `(ii) equal to or less than 40 percent, the Secretary may provide for such
 an acreage limitation program under which the acreage planted to wheat for
 harvest on a farm would be limited to the wheat crop acreage base for the
 farm for the crop reduced by not more than 0 to 15 percent.
For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term `total disappearance' means
all wheat utilization, including total domestic, total export, and total
residual disappearance.
 `(2) Acreage limitation program-
 `(A) PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS- Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a
 wheat acreage limitation program is announced under paragraph (1), such
 limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction
 (from 0 to 20 percent) to the wheat crop acreage base for the crop for each
 wheat-producing farm.
 `(B) COMPLIANCE- Except as provided in subsection (g) and section 504,
 producers who knowingly produce wheat in excess of the permitted wheat
 acreage for the farm shall be ineligible for wheat loans, purchases, and
 payments with respect to that farm.

 shall be determined under title V.
 `(D) ACREAGE DEVOTED TO CONSERVATION USES- A number of acres on the farm
 shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued
 by the Secretary. Such number shall be determined by multiplying the wheat
 crop acreage base by the percentage reduction required by the Secretary. The
 number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as
 `reduced acreage'. The remaining acreage is hereafter in this subsection
 referred to as `permitted acreage'. Permitted acreage may be adjusted by
 the Secretary as provided in paragraph (3) and in section 504.
 `(E) INDIVIDUAL FARM PROGRAM ACREAGE- Except as otherwise provided in
 subsection (c), the individual farm program acreage shall be the acreage
 planted on the farm to wheat for harvest within the permitted wheat acreage
 for the farm as established under this paragraph.

 crop on reduced acreage under this subparagraph--
 `(I) the amount of the deficiency payment that the producers are otherwise
 eligible to receive under subsection (c) shall be reduced, for each acre
 (or portion thereof) that is planted to the designated crop, by an amount
 equal to the deficiency payment that would be made with respect to a
 number of acres of the crop that the Secretary considers appropriate,
 except that if the producers on the farm are participating in a program
 established for more than one program crop, the amount of the reduction
 shall be determined by prorating the reduction based on the acreage planted
 or considered planted on the farm to all of such program crops; and
 `(II) the Secretary shall ensure that reductions in deficiency payments
 under subclause (I) are sufficient to ensure that this subparagraph will
 result in no additional cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
 `(3) Targeted option payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the
 Secretary implements an acreage limitation program with respect to any of
 the 1991 through 1995 crops of wheat, the Secretary may make available to
 producers on a farm who do not receive payments under subsection (c)(1)(E)
 for such crop on the farm, adjustments in the level of deficiency payments
 that would otherwise be made available to the producers if the producers
 exercise the payment options provided in this paragraph.
 `(B) PAYMENT OPTIONS- If the Secretary elects to carry out this paragraph,
 the Secretary shall make the payment options specified in subparagraphs
 (C) and (D) available to producers who agree to make adjustments in the

 payments to be made available to producers who participate in the program
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall increase the established price
 for wheat by an amount determined by the Secretary, but not less than 0.5
 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point increase in the
 acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers' wheat acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- The acreage limitation percentage to be applied to
 the producers' wheat acreage base shall not be increased by more than 10
 percentage points for the 1991 crop and 15 percentage points for each of the
 1992 through 1995 crops above the acreage limitation percentage announced
 by the Secretary for the crop or above 25 percent total for the crop.
 `(D) Decreased acreage limitation option-
 `(i) DECREASE IN ACREAGE LIMITATION REQUIREMENT- If the Secretary elects
 to carry out this paragraph, a producer shall be eligible to decrease the
 acreage limitation percentage applicable to the producers' wheat acreage
 base (as announced by the Secretary) if the producer agrees to a decrease
 in the established price for wheat under clause (ii) for the purpose of
 calculating deficiency payments to be made available to the producer.
 `(ii) METHOD OF CALCULATION- For the purposes of calculating deficiency
 payments to be made available to producers who choose the option set forth
 in this subparagraph, the Secretary shall decrease the established price for
 wheat by an amount to be determined by the Secretary, but not less than 0.5
 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point decrease in the
 acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers' wheat acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- A producer may not choose to decrease the acreage
 limitation percentage applicable to the producers' wheat acreage base under
 this paragraph by more than one-half of the announced acreage limitation
 percentage.
 `(E) PARTICIPATION AND PRODUCTION EFFECTS- Notwithstanding any other provision
 of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, ensure
 that the program provided for in this paragraph does not have a significant
 effect on program participation or total production and shall be offered
 in such a manner that the Secretary determines will result in no additional
 budget outlays. The Secretary shall provide an analysis of the Secretary's
 determination to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives
 and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.

 participates in an acreage reduction program established for a crop of wheat
 under this subsection shall be required to plant to an annual or perennial
 cover 50 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of the acreage that
 is required to be removed from the production of wheat, but not to exceed
 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of the crop acreage base
 established for the crop. This requirement shall not apply with respect to
 arid areas (including summer fallow areas), as determined by the Secretary.
 `(ii) Multiyear program-
 `(I) COST-SHARE ASSISTANCE- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover capable of improving water quality or wildlife habitat on the acreage,
 the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make available cost-share assistance
 for 25 percent of the approved cost of establishing the cover on not more than
 50 percent of the acreage that is required to be diverted from production,
 but not to exceed 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of
 the crop acreage base established for a crop.
 `(II) AGREEMENT OF PRODUCER- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover on the acreage under this subparagraph and receives cost-share
 assistance from the Corporation with respect to the cover, the producer,
 under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary,
 taking into consideration guidelines established by the State technical
 committees established in subtitle G of title XII of the Food Security Act
 of 1985, shall agree to maintain the perennial cover for a minimum of 3 years.
 `(iii) CONSERVING CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms
 and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of the
 acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe,
 plantago ovato, triticale, rye, mung beans, milkweed, or other commodity,
 if the Secretary determines that the production is needed to provide an
 adequate supply of the commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of
 the price support program, and will not affect farm income adversely.
 `(C) Haying and grazing-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in clause (ii), haying and grazing of
 reduced acreage, acreage devoted to a conservation use under subsection
 (c)(1)(E), and acreage diverted from production under a land diversion
 program established under this section shall be permitted, except during
 any consecutive 5-month period that is established by the State committee
 established under section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment
 Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b)) for a State. The 5-month period shall be established
 during the period beginning April 1, and ending October 31, of a year.

 (2) with respect to acreage required to be devoted to conservation uses
 shall provide that land that has been converted to water storage uses shall
 be considered to be devoted to conservation uses if the land was devoted
 to wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, or oilseeds in at least 3 of the
 immediately preceding 5 years. The land shall be considered to be devoted to
 conservation uses for the period that the land remains in water storage uses,
 but not to exceed 5 years subsequent to its conversion to water storage uses.
 `(ii) LIMITATIONS- Land converted to water storage uses for the purposes
 of this subparagraph may not be devoted to any commercial use, including
 commercial fish production. The water stored on the land may not be ground
 water. The farm on which the land is located must have been irrigated with
 ground water during at least 1 of the preceding 5 crop years.
 `(E) SUMMER FALLOW- In determining the quantity of land to be devoted
 to conservation uses under an acreage limitation program with respect to
 land that has been farmed under summer fallow practices, as defined by the
 Secretary, the Secretary shall consider the effects of soil erosion and
 such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.
 `(5) Land diversion payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may make land diversion payments to producers
 of wheat, whether or not an acreage limitation program for wheat is in
 effect, if the Secretary determines that the land diversion payments are
 necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of wheat to
 desirable goals. The land diversion payments shall be made to producers who,
 to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation
 uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in accordance with land diversion
 contracts entered into by the Secretary with the producers.
 `(B) AMOUNTS- The amounts payable to producers under land diversion contracts
 may be determined through the submission of bids for the contracts by
 producers in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe or through such
 other means as the Secretary determines appropriate. In determining the
 acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary shall take into consideration
 the extent of the diversion to be undertaken by the producers and the
 productivity of the acreage diverted.

 program or land diversion program in effect for the crop for the farm; by
 `(B) the higher of--
 `(i) the farm program payment yield for the farm; or
 `(ii) the average of the yield per harvested acre for wheat for the farm for
 each of the 5 crop years immediately preceding the crop year during which the
 producers first participate in the program established under this subsection,
 excluding the crop years with the highest and lowest yield per harvested
 acre and any crop year in which the commodity was not planted on the farm.
 `(4) TERMS AND CONDITIONS- Producers on a farm who elect to participate in
 the program established under this subsection for a crop of wheat shall--
 `(A) enter into an agreement with the Secretary providing that the producers
 shall comply with the program for the crop;
 `(B) not plant program commodities for harvest in a quantity in excess of
 the sum of the crop acreage bases for the farm; and
 `(C) be considered to have complied with the terms and conditions of the
 wheat acreage reduction program or land diversion program for the crop,
 even though the acreage planted to wheat on the farm exceeds the permitted
 acreage provided under the acreage reduction or land diversion program.
 `(5) Excess production-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Any quantity of wheat produced in a crop year on a farm
 in excess of the production limitation quantity for the farm may be stored
 by the producers for a period of not to exceed 5 marketing years and may
 be used only in accordance with this paragraph.
 `(B) Marketing in subsequent year-
 `(i) PARTICIPANTS IN PROGRAM- Producers on a farm who are participating in
 the program established under this subsection may market, barter, or use a
 quantity of the excess wheat referred to in subparagraph (A) equal to the

 are participating in an acreage reduction or a land diversion program for
 a crop of wheat may market, barter, or use a quantity of the excess wheat
 referred to in subparagraph (A) in an amount that reflects the quantity of
 wheat that would be expected to be produced on acreage that the producers
 agree to devote to approved conservation uses (in excess of any acreage
 reduction or land diversion requirements) during a crop year, as determined
 by the Secretary.
 `(6) DUTIES OF SECRETARY- In carrying out the pilot program established
 under this subsection, the Secretary--
 `(A) shall issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out the program;
 `(B) may require increased acreage reduction or land diversion requirements
 with respect to producers who have had excess wheat production in order to

 `(1) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
 Secretary shall make available to producers on a farm loans and purchases
 for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of corn produced on the farm at
 such level as the Secretary determines will encourage the exportation of
 feed grains and not result in excessive total stocks of feed grains after
 taking into consideration the cost of producing corn, supply and demand
 conditions, and world prices for corn.
 `(2) MINIMUM LOAN AND PURCHASE LEVEL- Except as provided in paragraphs
 (3) and (4), the loan and purchase level determined under paragraph (1)
 shall not be less than 85 percent of the simple average price received by

 of stocks and to retain market share; and
 `(II) containing a description of the need for such adjustment.
 `(ii) EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADJUSTMENT- The adjustment shall become effective no
 earlier than 60 calendar days after the date of submission of the report to
 the Committees, except that in the case of the 1991 crop of feed grains, the
 adjustment shall become effective on the date of the submission of the report.
 `(C) COMPETITIVE POSITION- Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the Secretary
 determines, not later than 60 days prior to the beginning of a marketing
 year for a crop, that the effective loan rate established for such crop
 will not maintain a competitive market position for corn, the Secretary may
 reduce the loan and purchase level for corn for the marketing year by an
 amount, in addition to any reduction under subparagraph (A), not to exceed
 10 percent in any year.
 `(D) NO EFFECT ON FUTURE YEARS- Any reduction in the loan and purchase
 level for corn under this paragraph shall not be considered in determining
 the loan and purchase level for corn for subsequent years.
 `(E) MINIMUM LOAN RATE- Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the loan rate
 for corn shall not be less than $1.76 per bushel, unless such rate would
 exceed 80 percent of the 5-year average market price determination.
 `(4) Marketing loan provisions-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may permit a producer to repay a loan
 made under this subsection for a crop at a level (except as provided in
 subparagraph (C)) that is the lesser of--
 `(i) the loan level determined for the crop;
 `(ii) the higher of--
 `(I) 70 percent of such level;
 `(II) if the loan level for a crop was reduced under paragraph (3),
 70 percent of the loan level that would have been in effect but for the
 reduction under paragraph (3); or
 `(iii) the prevailing world market price for feed grains (adjusted to United
 States quality and location), as determined by the Secretary.
 `(B) PREVAILING WORLD MARKET PRICE- If the Secretary permits a producer
 to repay a loan in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall
 prescribe by regulation--
 `(i) a formula to determine the prevailing world market price for feed
 grains, adjusted to United States quality and location; and
 `(ii) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the
 prevailing world market price for feed grains.
 `(C) ALTERNATIVE REPAYMENT RATES- For each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of
 feed grains, if the world market price for feed grains (adjusted to United
 States quality and location) as determined by the Secretary, is less than
 the loan level determined for the crop, the Secretary may permit a producer
 to repay a loan made under this subsection for a crop at such level (not
 in excess of the loan level determined for the crop) as the Secretary
 determines will--
 `(i) minimize potential loan forfeitures;
 `(ii) minimize the accumulation of feed grain stocks by the Federal
 Government;
 `(iii) minimize the cost incurred by the Federal Government in storing feed
 grains; and
 `(iv) allow feed grains produced in the United States to be marketed freely
 and competitively, both domestically and internationally.
 `(5) SIMPLE AVERAGE PRICE- For purposes of this section, the simple average
 price received by producers for the immediately preceding marketing year
 shall be based on the latest information available to the Secretary at the
 time of the determination.
 `(6) OTHER FEED GRAINS- The Secretary shall make available to producers loans
 and purchases for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of grain sorghums,
 barley, oats, and rye, respectively, produced on the farm at such level
 as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in relation to the
 level that loans and purchases are made available for corn, taking into
 consideration the feeding value of the commodity in relation to corn and
 other factors specified in section 401(b).
 `(b) Loan Deficiency Payments-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may, for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops
 of feed grains, make payments (hereafter in this section referred to as
 `loan deficiency payments') available to producers who, although eligible
 to obtain a loan or purchase agreement under subsection (a), agree to forgo
 obtaining the loan or agreement in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(2) COMPUTATION- A payment under this subsection shall be computed by
 multiplying--
 `(A) the loan payment rate; by
 `(B) the quantity of feed grains the producer is eligible to place under
 loan (or obtain a purchase agreement) but for which the producer forgoes
 obtaining the loan or agreement in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(3) LOAN PAYMENT RATE- For purposes of this subsection, the loan payment
 rate shall be the amount by which--
 `(A) the loan level determined for the crop under subsection (a); exceeds
 `(B) the level at which a loan may be repaid under subsection (a).
 `(c) Payments-
 `(1) Deficiency payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall make available to producers payments
 (hereafter in this section referred to as `deficiency payments') for each
 of the 1991 through 1995 crops of corn, grain sorghums, oats, and barley,
 in an amount computed by multiplying--
 `(i) the payment rate; by
 `(ii) the payment acres for the crop; by
 `(iii) the farm program payment yield established for the crop for the farm.
 `(B) PAYMENT RATE-
 `(i) PAYMENT RATE FOR 1991 THROUGH 1993 CROPS- The payment rate for each
 of the 1991 through 1993 crops of corn, grain sorghums, oats, and barley
 shall be the amount by which the established price for the respective crop
 of feed grains exceeds the higher of--
 `(I) the national weighted average market price received by producers during
 the first 5 months of the marketing year for the crop, as determined by
 the Secretary; or
 `(II) the loan level determined for the crop, prior to any adjustment made
 under subsection (a)(3) for the marketing year for the crop.
 `(ii) PAYMENT RATE OF 1994 AND 1995 CROPS- The payment rate for each of
 the 1994 and 1995 crops of corn, grain sorghums, oats, and barley shall be
 determined as provided in clause (i).

 1995 crops of grain sorghums shall not be less than $2.61 per bushel.
 `(IV) BARLEY-
 `(aa) IN GENERAL- The established price for barley shall be such price as the
 Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in relation to the established
 price for corn, taking into consideration the various feed and food uses
 for barley. The established price for barley shall not be less than 85.8
 percent of the established price for corn.
 `(bb) BARLEY CALCULATIONS- The Secretary shall, for purposes of determining
 the payment rate for barley under clause (i)(I) and subparagraph (D)(ii),
 use the national weighted average market price received by producers of
 barley sold primarily for feed purposes.
 `(cc) ADVANCE PAYMENTS- In the case of the 1991 crop of barley, the Secretary
 shall, for purposes of determining any advance deficiency payment made
 to the producers of barley under section 114, use the national weighted
 average market price received by producers for all barley, as determined
 by the Secretary.
 `(dd) EQUITY- In implementing this subsection, the Secretary shall make
 available to producers of the 1991 crop of barley, notwithstanding the
 method of calculation or the amount of the advance deficiency payment,
 the total amount of payments as calculated under clause (bb).
 `(C) PAYMENT ACRES- Payment acres for a crop shall be the lesser of--
 `(i) the number of acres planted to the crop for harvest within the permitted
 acreage; or
 `(ii) 100 percent of the crop acreage base for the crop for the farm less
 the quantity of reduced acreage (as determined under subsection (e)(2)(D)).
 `(D) Emergency compensation-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section,
 if the Secretary adjusts the level of loans and purchases for feed grains
 under subsection (a)(3), the Secretary shall provide emergency compensation
 by increasing the deficiency payments for feed grains by such amount as the
 Secretary determines necessary to provide the same total return to producers
 as if the adjustment in the level of loans and purchases had not been made.
 `(ii) CALCULATION- In determining the payment rate, per bushel, for emergency
 compensation payments for a crop of feed grains under this subparagraph,
 the Secretary shall use the national weighted average market price, per
 bushel of feed grains, received by producers during the marketing year for
 the crop, as determined by the Secretary.
 `(E) 0/92 program-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- If an acreage limitation program under subsection (e)(2)
 is in effect for a crop of feed grains and the producers on a farm devote
 a portion of the maximum payment acres for feed grains as calculated under
 subparagraph (C)(ii) of the farm equal to more than 8 percent of such feed
 grain acreage of the farm for the crop, to conservation uses (except as
 provided in subparagraph (F))--
 `(I) such portion of the maximum payment acres of the farm in excess of 8
 percent of such acreage devoted to conservation uses (except as provided
 in subparagraph (F)) shall be considered to be planted to feed grains for
 the purpose of determining the acreage on the farm required to be devoted
 to conservation uses in accordance with subsection (e)(2)(D); and
 `(II) the producers shall be eligible for payments under this paragraph
 with respect to such acreage.
 `(ii) DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
 section, any producer who devotes a portion of the maximum payment
 acres for feed grains for the farm to conservation uses (or other uses
 as provided in subparagraph (F)) under this subparagraph shall receive
 deficiency payments on the acreage that is considered to be planted to feed
 grains and eligible for payments under this subparagraph for the crop at a
 per-bushel rate established by the Secretary, except that the rate may not
 be established at less than the projected deficiency payment rate for the
 crop, as determined by the Secretary. Such projected payment rate for the
 crop shall be announced by the Secretary prior to the period during which
 feed grain producers may agree to participate in the program for the crop.
 `(iii) ADVERSE EFFECT ON AGRIBUSINESS AND OTHER INTERESTS- The Secretary
 shall implement this subparagraph in such a manner as to minimize the adverse
 effect on agribusiness and other agriculturally related economic interests
 within any county, State, or region. In carrying out this subparagraph,
 the Secretary is authorized to restrict the total quantity of feed grain
 acreage that may be taken out of production under this subparagraph,
 taking into consideration the total quantity of acreage that has or will be
 removed from production under other price support, production adjustment, or
 conservation program activities. No restrictions on the quantity of acreage
 that may be taken out of production in accordance with this subparagraph
 in a crop year shall be imposed in the case of a county in which producers
 were eligible to receive disaster emergency loans under section 321 of the
 Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961) as a result of
 a disaster that occurred during the crop year.
 `(iv) CROP ACREAGE AND PAYMENT YIELD- The feed grain crop acreage base and
 feed grain farm program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced due
 to the fact that a portion of the permitted feed grain acreage of the farm
 was devoted to conserving uses (except as provided in subparagraph (F))
 under this subparagraph.
 `(v) LIMITATION- Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (iv),
 payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater
 acreage than the acreage actually planted to feed grains.
 `(vi) CONSERVATION USE ACREAGE UNDER OTHER PROGRAMS- Any acreage considered to
 be planted to feed grains in accordance with clauses (i) and (iv) may not also
 be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any
 provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program requiring
 that the producers devote a specified acreage to conservation uses.
 `(F) ALTERNATIVE CROPS-
 `(i) INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such
 terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of
 acreage otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition
 of qualifying for payments under subparagraph (E) to be devoted to sweet
 sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe, plantago ovato, triticale,
 rye, mung beans, commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw material being imported,
 or likely to be imported, into the United States, or commodities grown
 for experimental purposes (including kenaf and milkweed), subject to the
 following sentence. The Secretary may permit the acreage to be devoted to
 the production only if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) the production is not likely to increase the cost of the price support
 program and will not affect farm income adversely; and
 `(II) the production is needed to provide an adequate supply of the commodity,
 or, in the case of commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw materials, the production
 is needed to encourage domestic manufacture of the raw material and could
 lead to increased industrial use of the raw material to the long-term
 benefit of United States industry.
 `(ii) OILSEEDS- The Secretary shall permit, subject to such terms and
 conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of acreage
 otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition of
 qualifying for payments under subparagraph (E) to be devoted to sunflowers,
 rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, and other minor oilseeds
 designated by the Secretary (excluding soybeans). In implementing this
 clause, the Secretary shall provide that, in order to receive payments under
 subparagraph (E), the producers shall agree to forgo eligibility to receive a
 loan under section 205 for the crop of any such oilseed produced on the farm.
 `(G) REDUCTION FOR DISASTER PAYMENTS- The total quantity of feed grains on
 which payments would otherwise be payable to a producer on a farm for any
 crop under this paragraph shall be reduced by the quantity on which any
 disaster payment is made to the producer for the crop under paragraph (2).
 `(2) Disaster payments-
 `(A) PREVENTED PLANTING- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the
 Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from planting
 any portion of the acreage intended for feed grains to feed grains or other
 nonconserving crops because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster,
 or other condition beyond the control of the producers, the Secretary shall
 make a prevented planting disaster payment to the producers in an amount
 equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
 `(i) the number of acres so affected but not to exceed the acreage planted
 to feed grains for harvest (including any acreage that the producers were
 prevented from planting to feed grains or other nonconserving crops in
 lieu of feed grains because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster,
 or other condition beyond the control of the producers) in the immediately
 preceding year; by
 `(ii) 75 percent of the farm program payment yield established for the farm
 by the Secretary; by
 `(iii) a payment rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price
 for the crop.
 `(B) REDUCED YIELDS- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the Secretary
 determines that because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or
 other condition beyond the control of the producers, the total quantity
 of feed grains that the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less
 than the result of multiplying 60 percent of the farm program payment yield
 established by the Secretary for the crop by the acreage planted for harvest
 for the crop, the Secretary shall make a reduced yield disaster payment to
 the producers at a rate equal to 50 percent of the established price for
 the crop for the deficiency in production below 60 percent for the crop.
 `(C) CROP INSURANCE- Producers on a farm shall not be eligible for--
 `(i) prevented planting disaster payments under subparagraph (A), if
 prevented planting crop insurance is available to the producers under the
 Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) with respect to the feed
 grain acreage of the producers; or
 `(ii) reduced yield disaster payments under subparagraph (B), if reduced
 yield crop insurance is available to the producers under such Act with
 respect to the feed grain acreage of the producers.
 `(D) Administration-
 `(i) ECONOMIC EMERGENCIES- Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), the Secretary
 may make a disaster payment to the producers on a farm under this paragraph
 if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) as the result of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the producers have suffered
 substantial losses of production either from being prevented from planting
 feed grains or other nonconserving crops or from reduced yields;
 `(II) the losses have created an economic emergency for the producers;
 `(III) crop insurance indemnity payments under the Federal Crop Insurance
 Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and other forms of assistance made available
 by the Federal Government to the producers for the losses are insufficient
 to alleviate the economic emergency; and
 `(IV) additional assistance must be made available to the producers to
 alleviate the economic emergency.
 `(ii) ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary may make such adjustments in the amount of
 payments made available under this paragraph with respect to an individual
 farm as necessary to ensure the equitable allotment of the payments among
 producers, taking into account other forms of Federal disaster assistance
 provided to the producers for the crop involved.
 `(d) PAYMENT YIELDS- The farm program payment yields for farms for each
 crop of feed grains shall be determined under title V.
 `(e) Acreage Reduction Programs-
 `(1) In general-
 `(A) ESTABLISHMENT- Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if
 the Secretary determines that the total supply of corn, grain sorghum,
 barley, or oats, in the absence of an acreage limitation program, will
 be excessive taking into account the need for an adequate carry-over to
 maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a national
 emergency, the Secretary may provide for any crop of corn, grain sorghum,
 barley, or oats an acreage limitation program as described in paragraph (2).
 `(B) AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM- In making a determination
 under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into consideration the
 number of acres placed in the agricultural resources conservation program
 established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985
 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et seq.).
 `(C) ANNOUNCEMENTS- If the Secretary elects to implement an acreage limitation
 program for any crop year, the Secretary shall announce the program not later
 than September 30 prior to the calendar year in which the crop is harvested,
 except that in the case of the 1991 crop, the Secretary shall announce the
 program as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this section.
 `(D) ADJUSTMENTS- Not later than November 15 of the year previous to the
 year in which the crop is harvested, the Secretary may make adjustments in
 the program announced under subparagraph (C) if the Secretary determines
 that there has been a significant change in the total supply of feed grains
 since the program was first announced.
 `(E) COMPLIANCE- As a condition of eligibility for loans, purchases, and
 payments for any such crop of feed grains, except as provided in subsections
 (f) and (g) and section 504, the producers on a farm must comply with the
 terms and conditions of the acreage limitation program and, if applicable,
 a land diversion program as provided in paragraph (5).
 `(F) ACREAGE LIMITATION PROGRAM FOR 1991 CROP- In the case of the 1991
 crop of corn, the Secretary shall provide for an acreage limitation program
 (as described in paragraph (2)) as provided in subparagraph (G).
 `(G) ACREAGE LIMITATION PROGRAMS FOR 1992 THROUGH 1995 CROPS- In the case
 of each of the 1992 through 1995 crops of corn, if the Secretary estimates
 for a marketing year for the crop that the ratio of ending stocks of corn
 to total disappearance of corn for the preceding marketing year will be--
 `(i) more than 25 percent, the Secretary shall provide for an acreage
 limitation program (as described in paragraph (2)) under which the acreage
 planted to corn for harvest on a farm would be limited to the corn crop
 acreage base for the farm for the crop reduced by not less than 10 percent
 nor more than 20 percent; or
 `(ii) equal to or less than 25 percent, the Secretary may provide for such
 an acreage limitation program under which the acreage planted to corn for
 harvest on a farm would be limited to the corn crop acreage base for the
 farm for the crop reduced by not more than 0 to 12.5 percent.
For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term `total disappearance' means
all corn utilization, including total domestic, total export, and total
residual disappearance.
 `(H) ACREAGE LIMITATION PROGRAM FOR 1991 THROUGH 1995 CROPS OF OATS- In
 the case of each of the 1991 through 1995 crops of oats, the Secretary
 shall provide for an acreage limitation program (as described in paragraph
 (2)) under which the acreage planted to oats for harvest on a farm would
 be limited to the oat crop acreage base for the farm for the crop reduced
 by not more than 0 percent.
 `(2) Acreage limitation program-
 `(A) PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS- Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a feed
 grain acreage limitation program is announced under paragraph (1), such
 limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction
 (from 0 to 20 percent) to the crop acreage base for corn, grain sorghum,
 barley, or oats, respectively, for each feed grain-producing farm.
 `(B) COMPLIANCE- Except as provided in subsection (g) and section 504,
 producers who knowingly produce a feed grain in excess of the respective
 permitted feed grain acreage for the farm shall be ineligible for feed
 grain loans, purchases, and payments with respect to that farm.
 `(C) CROP ACREAGE BASES- Feed grain crop acreage bases for each crop of
 feed grains shall be determined under title V.
 `(D) ACREAGE DEVOTED TO CONSERVATION USES- A number of acres on the farm shall
 be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by
 the Secretary. Such number shall be determined by multiplying the respective
 feed grain crop acreage base by the percentage reduction required by the
 Secretary. The number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection
 referred to as `reduced acreage'. The remaining acreage is hereafter in
 this subsection referred to as `permitted acreage'. Permitted acreage may
 be adjusted by the Secretary as provided in paragraph (3) and in section 504.
 `(E) INDIVIDUAL FARM PROGRAM ACREAGE- Except as otherwise provided in
 subsection (c), the individual farm program acreage shall be the acreage
 planted on the farm to feed grains for harvest within the permitted feed
 grain acreage for the farm as established under this paragraph.
 `(F) Planting designated crops on reduced acreage-
 `(i) DEFINITION OF DESIGNATED CROP- As used in this subparagraph, the term
 `designated crop' means a crop defined in section 504(b)(1), excluding any
 program crop as defined in section 502(3).
 `(ii) IN GENERAL- Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary may permit producers
 on a farm to plant a designated crop on no more than one-half of the reduced
 acreage on the farm.
 `(iii) LIMITATIONS- If the producers on a farm elect to plant a designated
 crop on reduced acreage under this subparagraph--
 `(I) the amount of the deficiency payment that the producers are otherwise
 eligible to receive under subsection (c) shall be reduced, for each acre
 (or portion thereof) that is planted to the designated crop, by an amount
 equal to the deficiency payment that would be made with respect to a
 number of acres of the crop that the Secretary considers appropriate,
 except that if the producers on the farm are participating in a program
 established for more than one program crop, the amount of the reduction
 shall be determined by prorating the reduction based on the acreage planted
 or considered planted on the farm to all of such program crops; and
 `(II) the Secretary shall ensure that reductions in deficiency payments
 under subclause (I) are sufficient to ensure that this subparagraph will
 result in no additional cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
 `(G) EXCEPTION FOR MALTING BARLEY- The Secretary may provide that no producer
 of malting barley shall be required as a condition of eligibility for feed
 grain loans, purchases, and payments to comply with any acreage limitation
 under this paragraph if the producer has previously produced a malting variety
 of barley for harvest, plants barley only of an acceptable malting variety
 for harvest, and meets such other conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.
 `(3) Targeted option payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the
 Secretary implements an acreage limitation program with respect to any of the
 1991 through 1995 crops of feed grains, the Secretary may make available to
 producers on a farm who do not receive payments under subsection (c)(1)(E)
 for such crop on the farm, adjustments in the level of deficiency payments
 that would otherwise be made available to the producers if the producers
 exercise the payment options provided in this paragraph.
 `(B) PAYMENT OPTIONS- If the Secretary elects to carry out this paragraph,
 the Secretary shall make the payment options specified in subparagraphs
 (C) and (D) available to producers who agree to make adjustments in the
 quantity of acreage diverted from the production of feed grains under an
 acreage limitation program in accordance with this paragraph.
 `(C) Increased acreage limitation option-
 `(i) INCREASE IN ESTABLISHED PRICE- If the Secretary elects to carry out
 this paragraph, a producer shall be eligible to receive an increase in the
 established price for corn under clause (ii) if the producer agrees to an
 increase in the acreage limitation percentage to be applied to the producers'
 corn acreage base above the acreage limitation percentage announced by
 the Secretary.
 `(ii) METHOD OF CALCULATION- For the purposes of calculating deficiency
 payments to be made available to producers who participate in the program
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall increase the established price
 for corn by an amount determined by the Secretary, but not less than 0.5
 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point increase in
 the acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers' corn acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- The acreage limitation percentage to be applied to
 the producers' corn acreage base shall not be increased by more than 5
 percentage points for the 1991 crop and 10 percentage points for each of the
 1992 through 1995 crops above the acreage limitation percentage announced
 by the Secretary for the crop or above 20 percent total for the crop.
 `(D) Decreased acreage limitation option-
 `(i) DECREASE IN ACREAGE LIMITATION REQUIREMENT- If the Secretary elects
 to carry out this paragraph, a producer shall be eligible to decrease the
 acreage limitation percentage applicable to the producers' corn acreage base
 (as announced by the Secretary) if the producer agrees to a decrease in the
 established price for corn under clause (ii) for the purpose of calculating
 deficiency payments to be made available to the producer.
 `(ii) METHOD OF CALCULATION- For the purposes of calculating deficiency
 payments to be made available to producers who choose the option set forth
 in this subparagraph, the Secretary shall decrease the established price for
 corn by an amount to be determined by the Secretary, but not less than 0.5
 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point decrease in
 the acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers' corn acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- A producer may not choose to decrease the acreage
 limitation percentage applicable to the producers' corn acreage base under
 this paragraph by more than one-half of the announced acreage limitation
 percentage.
 `(E) OTHER FEED GRAINS- The Secretary shall implement the program provided
 for by this paragraph for other feed grains similar to the manner in which
 the program is implemented for corn.
 `(F) PARTICIPATION AND PRODUCTION EFFECTS- Notwithstanding any other provision
 of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, ensure
 that the program provided for in this paragraph does not have a significant
 effect on program participation or total production and shall be offered
 in such a manner that the Secretary determines will result in no additional
 budget outlays. The Secretary shall provide an analysis of the Secretary's
 determination to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives
 and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.
 `(4) Administration-
 `(A) PROTECTION FROM WEEDS AND EROSION- The regulations issued by the
 Secretary under paragraph (2) with respect to acreage required to be devoted
 to conservation uses shall assure protection of the acreage from weeds and
 wind and water erosion.
 `(B) Annual or perennial cover-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in paragraph (2), a producer who
 participates in an acreage reduction program established for a crop of feed
 grains under this subsection shall be required to plant to an annual or
 perennial cover 50 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of the
 acreage that is required to be removed from the production of feed grains,
 but not to exceed 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of
 the crop acreage base established for the crop. This requirement shall
 not apply with respect to arid areas (including summer fallow areas),
 as determined by the Secretary.
 `(ii) Multiyear program-
 `(I) COST-SHARE ASSISTANCE- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover capable of improving water quality or wildlife habitat on the acreage,
 the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make available cost-share assistance
 for 25 percent of the approved cost of establishing the cover on not more than
 50 percent of the acreage that is required to be diverted from production,
 but not to exceed 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of
 the crop acreage base established for a crop.
 `(II) AGREEMENT OF PRODUCER- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover on the acreage under this subparagraph and receives cost-share
 assistance from the Corporation with respect to the cover, the producer,
 under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary,
 taking into consideration guidelines established by the State technical
 committees established in subtitle G of title XII of the Food Security Act
 of 1985, shall agree to maintain the perennial cover for a minimum of 3 years.
 `(iii) CONSERVING CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms
 and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of the
 acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe,
 plantago ovato, triticale, rye, mung beans, milkweed, or other commodity,
 if the Secretary determines that the production is needed to provide an
 adequate supply of the commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of
 the price support program, and will not affect farm income adversely.
 `(C) Haying and grazing-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in clause (ii), haying and grazing of
 reduced acreage, acreage devoted to a conservation use under subsection
 (c)(1)(E), and acreage diverted from production under a land diversion
 program established under this section shall be permitted, except during
 any consecutive 5-month period that is established by the State committee
 established under section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment
 Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b)) for a State. The 5-month period shall be established
 during the period beginning April 1, and ending October 31, of a year.
 `(ii) NATURAL DISASTERS- In the case of a natural disaster, the Secretary
 may permit unlimited haying and grazing on the acreage. The Secretary may
 not exclude irrigated or irrigable acreage not planted in alfalfa when
 exercising the authority under this clause.
 `(D) Water storage uses-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- The regulations issued by the Secretary under paragraph
 (2) with respect to acreage required to be devoted to conservation uses
 shall provide that land that has been converted to water storage uses shall
 be considered to be devoted to conservation uses if the land was devoted
 to wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, or oilseeds in at least 3 of the
 immediately preceding 5 years. The land shall be considered to be devoted to
 conservation uses for the period that the land remains in water storage uses,
 but not to exceed 5 years subsequent to its conversion to water storage uses.
 `(ii) LIMITATIONS- Land converted to water storage uses for the purposes
 of this subparagraph may not be devoted to any commercial use, including
 commercial fish production. The water stored on the land may not be ground
 water. The farm on which the land is located must have been irrigated with

 such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.
 `(5) Land diversion payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may make land diversion payments to producers
 of feed grains, whether or not an acreage limitation program for feed grains
 is in effect, if the Secretary determines that the land diversion payments are
 necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of feed grains to
 desirable goals. The land diversion payments shall be made to producers who,
 to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved conservation
 uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in accordance with land diversion
 contracts entered into by the Secretary with the producers.
 `(B) AMOUNTS- The amounts payable to producers under land diversion contracts
 may be determined through the submission of bids for the contracts by

 evidence of title, as determined by the Secretary, reflecting accrued storage
 charges of not more than 60 days, make available for the 1991 through
 1995 crops of upland cotton to producers on a farm nonrecourse loans for
 upland cotton produced on the farm for a term of 10 months from the first
 day of the month in which the loan is made at such loan level, per pound,
 as will reflect for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined by
 the Secretary, at average location in the United States a level that is
 not less than the smaller of--
 `(A) 85 percent of the average price (weighted by market and month) of
 the base quality of cotton as quoted in the designated United States spot
 markets during 3 years of the 5-year period ending July 31 in the year in
 which the loan level is announced, excluding the year in which the average
 price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest
 in the period; or
 `(B) 90 percent of the average, for the 15-week period beginning July 1
 of the year in which the loan level is announced, of the 5 lowest-priced
 growths of the growths quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-seconds inch
 cotton C.I.F. Northern Europe (adjusted downward by the average difference
 during the period April 15 through October 15 of the year in which the
 loan is announced between the average Northern European price quotation of
 such quality of cotton and the market quotations in the designated United
 States spot markets for the base quality of upland cotton, as determined
 by the Secretary.

 may consider appropriate, not in excess of the average United States spot
 market price determined under paragraph (1)(A).
 `(3) ANNOUNCEMENT OF LOAN LEVEL- The loan level for any crop of upland
 cotton shall be determined and announced by the Secretary not later than
 November 1 of the calendar year preceding the marketing year for which the
 loan is to be effective or, in the case of the 1991 crop, as soon as is
 practicable after the date of enactment of this Act. The loan level shall
 not thereafter be changed.
 `(4) Extension of loan period-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in subparagraph (B), nonrecourse loans
 provided for in this section shall, on request of the producer during the

 any month in which the average price of the base quality of upland cotton,
 as determined by the Secretary, in the designated spot markets for the
 preceding month exceeded 130 percent of the average price of such base
 quality of cotton in the designated United States spot markets for the
 preceding 36-month period.
 `(5) Marketing loan provisions-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- If the Secretary determines that the prevailing world market
 price for upland cotton (adjusted to United States quality and location)
 is below the loan level determined under the foregoing provisions of this
 subsection, in order to make United States upland cotton competitive in
 world markets, the Secretary shall permit a producer to repay a loan made
 for any crop at--
 `(i) a level that is the lesser of--
 `(I) the loan level determined for the crop; or

 `(I) the adjusted prevailing world market price is less than 115 percent
 of the current crop year loan level for the base quality of upland cotton,
 as determined by the Secretary; and
 `(II) the Friday through Thursday average price quotation for the
 lowest-priced United States growth as quoted for Middling (M) one and
 three-thirty seconds inch cotton delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe is greater
 than the Friday through Thursday average price of the five lowest-priced
 growths of upland cotton, as quoted for Middling (M) one and three-thirty
 seconds inch cotton, delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe (hereafter in this
 subsection referred to as the `Northern Europe price').
 `(ii) FURTHER ADJUSTMENT- Except as provided in clause (iii), the adjusted

 amount of the difference (reduced by 1.25 cents per pound) in such prices
 during the 4th week of the consecutive 4-week period multiplied by the
 quantity of upland cotton included in the documented sales.
 `(iii) ADMINISTRATION- Clauses (iv) through (vii) of subparagraph (B)
 shall apply to marketing certificates issued under this subparagraph. Any
 such certificates may be transferred to other persons in accordance with
 regulations issued by the Secretary.
 `(F) Special import quota-
 `(i) ESTABLISHMENT- The President shall, within 180 days after the date of
 enactment of this section, establish an import quota program which shall
 provide that, during the period beginning August 1991 and ending July 31,
 1996, whenever the Secretary determines and announces that for any consecutive
 10-week period, the Friday through Thursday average price quotation for
 the lowest-priced United States growth, as quoted for Middling (M) one
 and three-thirty seconds inch cotton, delivered C.I.F. Northern Europe,
 adjusted for the value of any certificates issued under subparagraph (E),
 exceeds the Northern Europe price by more than 1.25 cents per pound, there
 shall immediately be in effect a special limited global import quota.
 `(ii) QUANTITY- The quota shall be equal to 1 week's consumption of upland
 cotton by domestic mills at the seasonally adjusted average rate of the
 most recent 3 months for which data are available.
 `(iii) APPLICATION- The quota shall apply to upland cotton purchased not later
 than 90 days after the date of the Secretary's announcement under clause (i)
 and entered into the United States not later than 180 days after such date.
 `(iv) OVERLAP- A special quota period may be established that overlaps any
 existing quota period if required by clause (i), except that a special quota
 period may not be established under this paragraph if a special quota period
 has been established under subsection (n).
 `(6) RECOURSE LOANS FOR SEED COTTON- In order to encourage and assist
 producers in the orderly ginning and marketing of their production of upland
 cotton, the Secretary shall make recourse loans available to such producers
 on seed cotton in accordance with authority vested in the Secretary under
 the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714 et seq.).
 `(b) Loan Deficiency Payments-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall, for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops
 of upland cotton, make payments (hereafter in this section referred to as
 `loan deficiency payments') available to producers who, although eligible
 to obtain a loan under subsection (a), agree to forgo obtaining the loan
 in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(2) COMPUTATION- A payment under this subsection shall be computed by
 multiplying--
 `(A) the loan payment rate; by
 `(B) the quantity of upland cotton the producer is eligible to place under
 loan but for which the producer forgoes obtaining the loan in return for
 payments under this subsection.
 `(3) LOAN PAYMENT RATE- For purposes of this subsection, the loan payment
 rate shall be the amount by which--
 `(A) the loan level determined for the crop under subsection (a); exceeds
 `(B) the level at which a loan may be repaid under subsection (a).
 `(4) MARKETING CERTIFICATES- The Secretary may make up to one-half the
 amount of a payment under this subsection available in the form of marketing
 certificates, subject to the terms and conditions provided in subsection
 (a)(5)(B).
 `(c) Payments-
 `(1) Deficiency payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The Secretary shall make available to producers payments
 (hereafter in this section referred to as `deficiency payments') for each
 of the 1991 through 1995 crops of upland cotton in an amount computed
 by multiplying--
 `(i) the payment rate; by
 `(ii) the payment acres for the crop; by
 `(iii) the farm program payment yield established for the crop for the farm.
 `(B) Payment rate-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- The payment rate for upland cotton shall be the amount
 by which the established price for the crop of upland cotton exceeds the
 higher of--
 `(I) the national average market price received by producers during the
 calendar year that includes the first 5 months of the marketing year for
 the crop, as determined by the Secretary; or
 `(II) the loan level determined for the crop.
 `(ii) MINIMUM ESTABLISHED PRICE- The established price for upland cotton shall
 not be less than $0.729 per pound for each of the 1991 through 1995 crops.
 `(C) PAYMENT ACRES- Payment acres for a crop shall be the lesser of--
 `(i) the number of acres planted to the crop for harvest within the permitted
 acreage; or
 `(ii) 100 percent of the crop acreage base for the crop for the farm less
 the quantity of reduced acreage (as determined under subsection (e)(2)(D)).
 `(D) 50/92 program-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- If an acreage limitation program under subsection (e)(2)
 is in effect for a crop of upland cotton and the producers on a farm devote
 a portion of the maximum payment acres for upland cotton as calculated
 under subparagraph (C)(ii) of the farm equal to more than 8 percent of
 such upland cotton acreage of the farm for the crop to conservation uses
 (except as provided in subparagraph (E))--
 `(I) such portion of the maximum payment acres in excess of 8 percent of such
 acreage devoted to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph
 (E)) shall be considered to be planted to upland cotton for the purpose of
 determining the acreage on the farm required to be devoted to conservation
 uses in accordance with subsection (e)(2)(D); and
 `(II) the producers shall be eligible for payments under this paragraph
 with respect to such acreage, subject to the compliance of the producers
 with clause (ii).
 `(ii) MINIMUM PLANTING REQUIREMENT- To be eligible for payments under clause
 (i), except as provided in clauses (iv) and (v), the producers on a farm
 must actually plant upland cotton for harvest on at least 50 percent of
 the maximum payment acres for cotton for the farm.
 `(iii) DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
 section, any producer who devotes a portion of the maximum payment acres for
 upland cotton for the farm to conservation uses (or other uses as provided in
 subparagraph (E)) under this subparagraph shall receive deficiency payments on
 the acreage that is considered to be planted to upland cotton and eligible for
 payments under this subparagraph for the crop at a per-pound rate established
 by the Secretary, except that the rate may not be established at less than
 the projected deficiency payment rate for the crop, as determined by the
 Secretary. Such projected payment rate for the crop shall be announced by
 the Secretary prior to the period during which upland cotton producers may
 agree to participate in the program for the crop.
 `(iv) QUARANTINES- If a State or local agency has imposed in an area of a
 State or county a quarantine on the planting of upland cotton for harvest
 on farms in the area, the State committee established under section 8(b)
 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b))
 may recommend to the Secretary that payments be made under this paragraph,
 without regard to the requirement imposed under clause (ii), to producers
 in the area who were required to forgo the planting of upland cotton
 for harvest on acreage to alleviate or eliminate the condition requiring
 the quarantine. If the Secretary determines that the condition exists,
 the Secretary may make payments under this paragraph to the producers. To
 be eligible for payments under this clause, the producers must devote the
 acreage to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)).
 `(v) PREVENTED PLANTING- If an acreage limitation program under subsection (e)
 is in effect for any crop of upland cotton and if the Secretary determines
 that producers on a farm are prevented from planting the acreage intended
 for upland cotton to upland cotton because of drought, flood, or other
 natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers,
 the Secretary shall make available to such producers payments under this
 subparagraph without regard to the requirement imposed under clause (ii). To
 be eligible for payments under this clause, the producers must devote the
 acreage to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)). Any
 such acreage shall be considered to be planted to upland cotton.
 `(vi) CROP ACREAGE AND PAYMENT YIELD- The upland cotton crop acreage base and
 upland cotton farm program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced
 due to the fact that a portion of the permitted cotton acreage of the farm
 was devoted to conserving uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E))
 under this subparagraph.
 `(vii) LIMITATION- Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (vi),
 payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater
 acreage than the acreage actually planted to upland cotton.
 `(viii) CONSERVATION USE ACREAGE UNDER OTHER PROGRAMS- Any acreage considered
 to be planted to upland cotton in accordance with clauses (i) and (vi) may not
 also be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling
 any provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program
 requiring that the producers devote a specified acreage to conservation uses.
 `(E) ALTERNATIVE CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms
 and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of acreage
 otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition of
 qualifying for payments under subparagraph (D) to be devoted to sweet
 sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe, plantago ovato, triticale,
 rye, mung beans, commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw material being imported,
 or likely to be imported, into the United States, or commodities grown
 for experimental purposes (including kenaf and milkweed), subject to the
 following sentence. The Secretary may permit the acreage to be devoted to
 the production only if the Secretary determines that--
 `(i) the production is not likely to increase the cost of the price support
 program and will not affect farm income adversely; and
 `(ii) the production is needed to provide an adequate supply of the commodity,
 or, in the case of commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw materials, the production
 is needed to encourage domestic manufacture of the raw material and could
 lead to increased industrial use of the raw material to the long-term
 benefit of United States industry.
 `(F) REDUCTION FOR DISASTER PAYMENTS- The total quantity of upland cotton
 on which payments would otherwise be payable to a producer on a farm for
 any crop under this paragraph shall be reduced by the quantity on which
 any disaster payment is made to the producer for the crop under paragraph (2).
 `(2) Disaster payments-
 `(A) PREVENTED PLANTING- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the
 Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from
 planting any portion of the acreage intended for upland cotton to upland
 cotton or other nonconserving crops because of drought, flood, or other
 natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of the producers,
 the Secretary shall make a prevented planting disaster payment to the
 producers in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
 `(i) the number of acres so affected but not to exceed the acreage planted
 to upland cotton for harvest (including any acreage that the producers were
 prevented from planting to upland cotton or other nonconserving crops in
 lieu of upland cotton because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster,
 or other condition beyond the control of the producers) in the immediately
 preceding year; by
 `(ii) 75 percent of the farm program payment yield established for the farm
 by the Secretary; by
 `(iii) a payment rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price
 for the crop.
 `(B) REDUCED YIELDS- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the Secretary
 determines that because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or
 other condition beyond the control of the producers, the total quantity of
 upland cotton that the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less
 than the result of multiplying 75 percent of the farm program payment yield
 established by the Secretary for the crop by the acreage planted for harvest
 for the crop, the Secretary shall make a reduced yield disaster payment to
 the producers at a rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price
 for the crop for the deficiency in production below 75 percent for the crop.
 `(C) CROP INSURANCE- Producers on a farm shall not be eligible for--
 `(i) prevented planting disaster payments under subparagraph (A), if
 prevented planting crop insurance is available to the producers under the
 Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) with respect to the
 upland cotton acreage of the producers; or
 `(ii) reduced yield disaster payments under subparagraph (B), if reduced
 yield crop insurance is available to the producers under such Act with
 respect to the upland cotton acreage of the producers.
 `(D) Administration-
 `(i) ECONOMIC EMERGENCIES- Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), the Secretary
 may make a disaster payment to the producers on a farm under this paragraph
 if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) as the result of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the producers have suffered
 substantial losses of production either from being prevented from planting
 upland cotton or other nonconserving crops or from reduced yields;
 `(II) the losses have created an economic emergency for the producers;
 `(III) crop insurance indemnity payments under the Federal Crop Insurance
 Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and other forms of assistance made available
 by the Federal Government to the producers for the losses are insufficient
 to alleviate the economic emergency; and
 `(IV) additional assistance must be made available to the producers to
 alleviate the economic emergency.
 `(ii) ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary may make such adjustments in the amount of
 payments made available under this paragraph with respect to an individual
 farm as necessary to ensure the equitable allotment of the payments among
 producers, taking into account other forms of Federal disaster assistance
 provided to the producers for the crop involved.
 `(d) PAYMENT YIELDS- The farm program payment yields for farms for each
 crop of upland cotton shall be determined under title V.
 `(e) Acreage Reduction Programs-
 `(1) In general-
 `(A) ESTABLISHMENT- Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if the
 Secretary determines that the total supply of upland cotton, in the absence
 of an acreage limitation program, will be excessive taking into account the
 need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable supplies
 and prices and to meet a national emergency, the Secretary may provide for
 any crop of upland cotton an acreage limitation program as described in
 paragraph (2).
 `(B) AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM- In making a determination
 under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into consideration the
 number of acres placed in the agricultural resources conservation program
 established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985
 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et seq.).
 `(C) Announcements-
 `(i) PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT- If the Secretary elects to implement an
 acreage limitation program for any crop year, the Secretary shall make a
 preliminary announcement of any such program not later than November 1 of
 the calendar year preceding the year in which the crop is harvested, except
 that in the case of the 1991 crop, the Secretary shall announce the program
 as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this section. The
 announcement shall include, among other information determined necessary
 by the Secretary, an announcement of the uniform percentage reduction in
 the upland cotton crop acreage base described in paragraph (2)(A).
 `(ii) FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT- Not later than January 1 of the calendar year in
 which the crop is harvested, the Secretary shall make a final announcement
 of the program. The announcement shall include, among other information
 determined necessary by the Secretary, an announcement of the uniform
 percentage reduction in the upland cotton crop described in paragraph (2)(A).
 `(iii) OPTIONAL PROGRAMS IN EARLY PLANTING AREAS- The Secretary shall allow
 producers in early planting areas to elect to participate in the program
 on the terms of the acreage limitation program--
 `(I) first announced for the crop under clause (i); or
 `(II) as subsequently revised under clause (ii),
if the Secretary determines that the producers may be unfairly disadvantaged
by the revision.
 `(D) DESIRED CARRY-OVER- The Secretary shall carry out an acreage limitation
 program described in paragraph (2) for a crop of upland cotton in a manner
 that will result in a ratio of carry-over to total disappearance of 30
 percent, based on the Secretary's most recent projection of carry-over and
 total disappearance at the time of announcement of the acreage limitation
 program. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term `total disappearance'
 means all upland cotton utilization, including total domestic, total export,
 and total residual disappearance.
 `(2) Acreage limitation program-
 `(A) UNIFORM PERCENTAGE REDUCTION- Except as provided in paragraph (3), if an
 upland cotton acreage limitation program is announced under paragraph (1),
 the limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction
 (from 0 to 25 percent) to the upland cotton crop acreage base for the crop
 for each upland cotton-producing farm.
 `(B) COMPLIANCE- Except as provided in section 504, producers who knowingly
 produce upland cotton in excess of the permitted upland cotton acreage
 for the farm, as established in accordance with subparagraph (A), shall be
 ineligible for upland cotton loans and payments with respect to that farm.
 `(C) CROP ACREAGE BASES- Upland cotton crop acreage bases for each crop of
 upland cotton shall be determined under title V.
 `(D) ACREAGE DEVOTED TO CONSERVATION USES- A number of acres on the farm shall
 be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the
 Secretary. Such number shall be determined by multiplying the upland cotton
 crop acreage base by the percentage reduction required by the Secretary. The
 number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as
 `reduced acreage'. The remaining acreage is hereafter in this subsection
 referred to as `permitted acreage'. Permitted acreage may be adjusted by
 the Secretary as provided in paragraph (3) and in section 504.
 `(E) INDIVIDUAL FARM PROGRAM ACREAGE- Except as otherwise provided in
 subsection (c), the individual farm program acreage shall be the acreage
 planted on the farm to upland cotton for harvest within the permitted upland
 cotton acreage for the farm as established under this paragraph.
 `(F) Planting designated crops on reduced acreage-
 `(i) DEFINITION OF DESIGNATED CROP- As used in this subparagraph, the term
 `designated crop' means a crop defined in section 504(b)(1), excluding any
 program crop as defined in section 502(3).
 `(ii) IN GENERAL- Subject to clause (iii), the Secretary may permit producers
 on a farm to plant a designated crop on no more than one-half of the reduced
 acreage on the farm.
 `(iii) LIMITATIONS- If the producers on a farm elect to plant a designated
 crop on reduced acreage under this subparagraph--
 `(I) the amount of the deficiency payment that the producers are otherwise
 eligible to receive under subsection (c) shall be reduced, for each acre
 (or portion thereof) that is planted to the designated crop, by an amount
 equal to the deficiency payment that would be made with respect to a
 number of acres of the crop that the Secretary considers appropriate,
 except that if the producers on the farm are participating in a program
 established for more than one program crop, the amount of the reduction
 shall be determined by prorating the reduction based on the acreage planted
 or considered planted on the farm to all of such program crops; and
 `(II) the Secretary shall ensure that reductions in deficiency payments
 under subclause (I) are sufficient to ensure that this subparagraph will
 result in no additional cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
 `(3) Targeted option payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
 if the Secretary implements an acreage limitation program with respect to
 any of the 1991 through 1995 crops of upland cotton, the Secretary may make
 available to producers on a farm who do not receive payments under subsection
 (c)(1)(D) for such crop on the farm, adjustments in the level of deficiency
 payments that would otherwise be made available to the producers if the
 producers exercise the payment options provided in this paragraph.
 `(B) PAYMENT OPTIONS- If the Secretary elects to carry out this paragraph,
 the Secretary shall make the payment options specified in subparagraphs
 (C) and (D) available to producers who agree to make adjustments in the
 quantity of acreage diverted from the production of upland cotton under an
 acreage limitation program in accordance with this paragraph.
 `(C) Increased acreage limitation option-
 `(i) INCREASE IN ESTABLISHED PRICE- If the Secretary elects to carry out
 this paragraph, a producer shall be eligible to receive an increase in
 the established price for upland cotton under clause (ii) if the producer
 agrees to an increase in the acreage limitation percentage to be applied
 to the producers' upland cotton acreage base above the acreage limitation
 percentage announced by the Secretary.
 `(ii) METHOD OF CALCULATION- For the purposes of calculating deficiency
 payments to be made available to producers who participate in the program
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall increase the established price
 for upland cotton by an amount determined by the Secretary, but not less
 than 0.5 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point
 increase in the acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers'
 upland cotton acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- The acreage limitation percentage to be applied to the
 producers' upland cotton acreage base shall not be increased by more than
 10 percentage points above the acreage limitation percentage announced by
 the Secretary for the crop or above 25 percent total for the crop.
 `(iv) ADJUSTMENT FOR UNDERPLANTINGS- In determining the increased acreage
 limitation percentage that is applied to the producer's upland cotton base
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall exclude an amount of acreage
 equal to the average difference between the producer's permitted upland
 cotton acreage and the acreage actually planted (including acreage devoted
 to conserving uses under subsection (c)(1)(D)) to upland cotton for harvest
 during the previous 2 years.
 `(D) Decreased acreage limitation option-
 `(i) DECREASE IN ACREAGE LIMITATION REQUIREMENT- If the Secretary elects
 to carry out this paragraph, a producer shall be eligible to decrease the
 acreage limitation percentage applicable to the producers' upland cotton
 acreage base (as announced by the Secretary) if the producer agrees to
 a decrease in the established price for upland cotton under clause (ii)
 for the purpose of calculating deficiency payments to be made available to
 the producer.
 `(ii) METHOD OF CALCULATION- For the purposes of calculating deficiency
 payments to be made available to producers who choose the option set forth
 in this subparagraph, the Secretary shall decrease the established price
 for upland cotton by an amount to be determined by the Secretary, but not
 less than 0.5 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point
 decrease in the acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers'
 upland cotton acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- A producer may not choose to decrease the acreage
 limitation percentage applicable to the producers' upland cotton acreage
 base under this paragraph by more than one-half of the announced acreage
 limitation percentage.
 `(E) PARTICIPATION AND PRODUCTION EFFECTS- Notwithstanding any other provision
 of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, ensure
 that the program provided for in this paragraph does not have a significant
 effect on program participation or total production and shall be offered
 in such a manner that the Secretary determines will result in no additional
 budget outlays. The Secretary shall provide an analysis of the Secretary's
 determination to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives
 and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.
 `(4) Administration-
 `(A) PROTECTION FROM WEEDS AND EROSION- The regulations issued by the
 Secretary under paragraph (2) with respect to acreage required to be devoted
 to conservation uses shall assure protection of the acreage from weeds and
 wind and water erosion.
 `(B) Annual or perennial cover-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in paragraph (2), a producer who
 participates in an acreage reduction program established for a crop of
 upland cotton under this subsection shall be required to plant to an annual
 or perennial cover 50 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of
 the acreage that is required to be removed from the production of upland
 cotton, but not to exceed 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer)
 of the crop acreage base established for the crop. This requirement shall
 not apply with respect to arid areas (including summer fallow areas),
 as determined by the Secretary.
 `(ii) Multiyear program-
 `(I) COST-SHARE ASSISTANCE- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover capable of improving water quality or wildlife habitat on the acreage,
 the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make available cost-share assistance
 for 25 percent of the approved cost of establishing the cover on not more than
 50 percent of the acreage that is required to be diverted from production,
 but not to exceed 5 percent (or more, at the option of the producer) of
 the crop acreage base established for a crop.
 `(II) AGREEMENT OF PRODUCER- If a producer elects to establish a perennial
 cover on the acreage under this subparagraph and receives cost-share
 assistance from the Corporation with respect to the cover, the producer,
 under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary,
 taking into consideration guidelines established by the State technical
 committees established in subtitle G of title XII of the Food Security Act
 of 1985, shall agree to maintain the perennial cover for a minimum of 3 years.
 `(iii) CONSERVING CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms
 and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of the
 acreage to be devoted to sweet sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe,
 plantago ovato, triticale, rye, mung beans, milkweed, or other commodity,
 if the Secretary determines that the production is needed to provide an
 adequate supply of the commodities, is not likely to increase the cost of
 the price support program, and will not affect farm income adversely.
 `(C) Haying and grazing-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in clause (ii), haying and grazing of
 reduced acreage, acreage devoted to a conservation use under subsection
 (c)(1)(D), and acreage diverted from production under a land diversion
 program established under this section shall be permitted, except during
 any consecutive 5-month period that is established by the State committee
 established under section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment
 Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b)) for a State. The 5-month period shall be established
 during the period beginning April 1, and ending October 31, of a year.
 `(ii) NATURAL DISASTERS- In the case of a natural disaster, the Secretary
 may permit unlimited haying and grazing on the acreage. The Secretary may
 not exclude irrigated or irrigable acreage not planted in alfalfa when
 exercising the authority under this clause.
 `(D) Water storage uses-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- The regulations issued by the Secretary under paragraph
 (2) with respect to acreage required to be devoted to conservation uses
 shall provide that land that has been converted to water storage uses shall
 be considered to be devoted to conservation uses if the land was devoted
 to wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, or oilseeds in at least 3 of the
 immediately preceding 5 years. The land shall be considered to be devoted to
 conservation uses for the period that the land remains in water storage uses,
 but not to exceed 5 years subsequent to its conversion to water storage uses.
 `(ii) LIMITATIONS- Land converted to water storage uses for the purposes
 of this subparagraph may not be devoted to any commercial use, including
 commercial fish production. The water stored on the land may not be ground
 water. The farm on which the land is located must have been irrigated with
 ground water during at least 1 of the preceding 5 crop years.
 `(5) Land diversion program-
 `(A) Payments-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may make land diversion payments to producers
 of upland cotton, whether or not an acreage limitation program for upland
 cotton is in effect, if the Secretary determines that the land diversion
 payments are necessary to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of
 upland cotton to desirable goals. The land diversion payments shall be made to
 producers who, to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, devote to approved
 conservation uses an acreage of cropland on the farm in accordance with
 land diversion contracts entered into by the Secretary with the producers.
 `(ii) EXCESS CARRY-OVER- If, at the time of final announcement of the
 acreage limitation program established under this subsection, the projected
 carry-over of upland cotton for the crop year is equal to or greater than
 8 million bales, the Secretary shall offer a paid land diversion program
 to producers of upland cotton. Payments to producers under such a program
 shall be determined by multiplying--
 `(I) the payment rate, of not less than 35 cents per pound of cotton,
 established by the Secretary; by
 `(II) the program payment yield established for the crop for the farm; by
 `(III) the number of permitted upland cotton acres diverted on the farm.
 `(B) BIDS FOR CONTRACTS- The amounts payable to producers under land
 diversion contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for
 the contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe
 or through such other means as the Secretary determines appropriate. In
 determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary shall take
 into consideration the extent of the diversion to be undertaken by the
 producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted.
 `(C) Limitations on diverted acreage-
 `(i) MAXIMUM ACREAGE PER FARM, COUNTY, OR COMMUNITY- The Secretary shall
 limit the total acreage to be diverted under this paragraph--
 `(I) to not more than 15 percent of the upland cotton crop acreage base
 for a farm; and
 `(II) under agreements in any county or local community so as not to affect
 adversely the economy of the county or local community.
 `(ii) LOWER PARTICIPATION LEVELS- The Secretary may allow producers to
 participate in a land diversion program under this paragraph at a level
 lower than the maximum level announced by the Secretary, at the option of
 the producer, if the Secretary determines that it will increase participation
 in the program.
 `(6) Conservation practices-
 `(A) WILDLIFE FOOD PLOTS OR HABITAT- The reduced acreage and additional
 diverted acreage may be devoted to wildlife food plots or wildlife habitat
 in conformity with standards established by the Secretary in consultation
 with wildlife agencies. The Secretary may pay an appropriate share of the
 cost of practices designed to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.
 `(B) PUBLIC ACCESS- The Secretary may provide for an additional payment
 on the acreage in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate
 in relation to the benefit to the general public if the producer agrees to
 permit, without other compensation, access to all or such portion of the farm,
 as the Secretary may prescribe, by the general public, for hunting, trapping,
 fishing, and hiking, subject to applicable State and Federal regulations.
 `(7) Participation agreements-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Producers on a farm desiring to participate in the program
 conducted under this subsection shall execute an agreement with the Secretary
 providing for the participation not later than such date as the Secretary
 may prescribe.
 `(B) MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION- The Secretary may, by mutual agreement with
 producers on a farm, modify or terminate any such agreement if the Secretary
 determines the action necessary because of an emergency created by drought
 or other disaster or to prevent or alleviate a shortage in the supply of
 agricultural commodities. The Secretary may modify the agreement under
 this subparagraph for the purpose of alleviating a shortage in the supply
 of agricultural commodities only if there has been a significant change
 in the estimated stocks of the commodity since the Secretary announced the
 final terms and conditions of the program for the crop of upland cotton.
 `(f) Inventory Reduction Payments-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may, for each of the 1991 through 1995
 crops of upland cotton, make payments available to producers who meet the
 requirements of this subsection.
 `(2) FORM- The payments may be made in the form of marketing certificates.
 `(3) PAYMENTS-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Payments under this subsection shall be determined in the
 same manner as provided in subsection (b).
 `(B) QUANTITY OF COTTON MADE AVAILABLE- The quantity of upland cotton to
 be made available to a producer under this subsection shall be equal in
 value to the payments so determined under this subsection.
 `(4) ELIGIBILITY- A producer shall be eligible to receive a payment under
 this subsection for a crop if the producer--
 `(A) agrees to forgo obtaining a loan under subsection (a);
 `(B) agrees to forgo receiving payments under subsection (c);
 `(C) does not plant upland cotton for harvest in excess of the crop
 acreage base reduced by one-half of any acreage required to be diverted
 from production under subsection (e); and
 `(D) otherwise complies with this section.
 `(g) Equitable Relief-

 crops of rice, make payments (hereafter in this section referred to as
 `loan deficiency payments') available to producers who, although eligible
 to obtain a loan or purchase agreement under subsection (a), agree to forgo
 obtaining the loan or agreement in return for payments under this subsection.
 `(2) COMPUTATION- A payment under this subsection shall be computed by
 multiplying--
 `(A) the loan payment rate; by

 `(iii) the farm program payment yield established for the crop for the farm.
 `(B) Payment rate-
 `(i) PAYMENT RATE FOR 1991 THROUGH 1993 CROPS- The payment rate for each
 of the 1991 through 1993 crops of rice shall be the amount by which the

 `(D) 50/92 program-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- If an acreage limitation program under subsection (e)(2) is
 in effect for a crop of rice and the producers on a farm devote a portion of
 the maximum payment acres for rice as calculated under subparagraph (C)(ii)
 for equal to more than 8 percent of such rice acreage of the farm for the
 crop to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E))--
 `(I) such portion of the maximum payment acres in excess of 8 percent of such
 acreage devoted to conservation uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E))
 shall be considered to be planted to rice for the purpose of determining
 the acreage on the farm required to be devoted to conservation uses in
 accordance with subsection (e)(2)(D); and
 `(II) the producers shall be eligible for payments under this paragraph
 with respect to such acreage, subject to the compliance of the producers
 with clause (ii).
 `(ii) MINIMUM PLANTING REQUIREMENT- To be eligible for payments under clause

 must actually plant rice for harvest on at least 50 percent of the maximum
 payment acres for rice for the farm.
 `(iii) DEFICIENCY PAYMENTS- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
 section, any producer who devotes a portion of the maximum payment acres
 for rice for the farm to conservation uses (or other uses as provided in
 subparagraph (E)) under this subparagraph shall receive deficiency payments
 on the acreage that is considered to be planted to rice and eligible for
 payments under this subparagraph for the crop at a per-hundredweight rate
 established by the Secretary, except that the rate may not be established at
 less than the projected deficiency payment rate for the crop, as determined
 by the Secretary. Such projected payment rate for the crop shall be announced
 by the Secretary prior to the period during which rice producers may agree
 to participate in the program for the crop.
 `(iv) QUARANTINES- If a State or local agency has imposed in an area of
 a State or county a quarantine on the planting of rice for harvest on
 farms in the area, the State committee established under section 8(b)
 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b))
 may recommend to the Secretary that payments be made under this paragraph,
 without regard to the requirement imposed under clause (ii), to producers
 in the area who were required to forgo the planting of rice for harvest on
 acreage to alleviate or eliminate the condition requiring the quarantine. If
 the Secretary determines that the condition exists, the Secretary may make
 payments under this paragraph to the producers. To be eligible for payments
 under this clause, the producers must devote the acreage to conservation uses
 (except as provided in subparagraph (E)).
 `(v) PREVENTED PLANTING- If an acreage limitation program under subsection
 (e) is in effect for any crop of rice and if the Secretary determines that
 producers on a farm are prevented from planting the acreage intended for
 rice to rice because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the Secretary shall make
 available to such producers payments under this subparagraph without regard
 to the requirement imposed under clause (ii). To be eligible for payments
 under this clause, the producers must devote the acreage to conservation
 uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)). Any such acreage shall be
 considered to be planted to rice.
 `(vi) CROP ACREAGE AND PAYMENT YIELD- The rice crop acreage base and rice farm
 program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced due to the fact that
 a portion of the permitted rice acreage of the farm was devoted to conserving
 uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)) under this subparagraph.
 `(vii) LIMITATION- Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (vi),
 payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater
 acreage than the acreage actually planted to rice.
 `(viii) CONSERVATION USE ACREAGE UNDER OTHER PROGRAMS- Any acreage considered
 to be planted to rice in accordance with clauses (i) and (vi) may not also
 be designated as conservation use acreage for the purpose of fulfilling any
 provisions under any acreage limitation or land diversion program requiring
 that the producers devote a specified acreage to conservation uses.
 `(E) ALTERNATIVE CROPS- The Secretary may permit, subject to such terms
 and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of acreage
 otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition of
 qualifying for payments under subparagraph (D) to be devoted to sweet
 sorghum, guar, sesame, castor beans, crambe, plantago ovato, triticale,
 rye, mung beans, commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw material being imported,
 or likely to be imported, into the United States, or commodities grown
 for experimental purposes (including kenaf and milkweed), subject to the
 following sentence. The Secretary may permit the acreage to be devoted to
 the production only if the Secretary determines that--
 `(i) the production is not likely to increase the cost of the price support
 program and will not affect farm income adversely; and
 `(ii) the production is needed to provide an adequate supply of the commodity,
 or, in the case of commodities for which no substantial domestic production or
 market exists but that could yield industrial raw materials, the production
 is needed to encourage domestic manufacture of the raw material and could
 lead to increased industrial use of the raw material to the long-term
 benefit of United States industry.
 `(F) REDUCTION FOR DISASTER PAYMENTS- The total quantity of rice on which
 payments would otherwise be payable to a producer on a farm for any crop
 under this paragraph shall be reduced by the quantity on which any disaster
 payment is made to the producer for the crop under paragraph (2).
 `(2) Disaster payments-
 `(A) PREVENTED PLANTING- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the
 Secretary determines that the producers on a farm are prevented from
 planting any portion of the acreage intended for rice to rice or other
 nonconserving crops because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster,
 or other condition beyond the control of the producers, the Secretary shall
 make a prevented planting disaster payment to the producers in an amount
 equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
 `(i) the number of acres so affected but not to exceed the acreage planted
 to rice for harvest (including any acreage that the producers were prevented
 from planting to rice or other nonconserving crops in lieu of rice because
 of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond
 the control of the producers) in the immediately preceding year; by
 `(ii) 75 percent of the farm program payment yield established for the farm
 by the Secretary; by
 `(iii) a payment rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price
 for the crop.
 `(B) REDUCED YIELDS- Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if the Secretary
 determines that because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the total quantity of rice
 that the producers are able to harvest on any farm is less than the result
 of multiplying 75 percent of the farm program payment yield established by
 the Secretary for the crop by the acreage planted for harvest for the crop,
 the Secretary shall make a reduced yield disaster payment to the producers
 at a rate equal to 33 1/3  percent of the established price for the crop
 for the deficiency in production below 75 percent for the crop.
 `(C) CROP INSURANCE- Producers on a farm shall not be eligible for--
 `(i) prevented planting disaster payments under subparagraph (A), if prevented
 planting crop insurance is available to the producers under the Federal Crop
 Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) with respect to the rice acreage of
 the producers; or
 `(ii) reduced yield disaster payments under subparagraph (B), if reduced
 yield crop insurance is available to the producers under such Act with
 respect to the rice acreage of the producers.
 `(D) Administration-
 `(i) ECONOMIC EMERGENCIES- Notwithstanding subparagraph (C), the Secretary
 may make a disaster payment to the producers on a farm under this paragraph
 if the Secretary determines that--
 `(I) as the result of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other
 condition beyond the control of the producers, the producers have suffered
 substantial losses of production either from being prevented from planting
 rice or other nonconserving crops or from reduced yields;
 `(II) the losses have created an economic emergency for the producers;
 `(III) crop insurance indemnity payments under the Federal Crop Insurance
 Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and other forms of assistance made available
 by the Federal Government to the producers for the losses are insufficient
 to alleviate the economic emergency; and
 `(IV) additional assistance must be made available to the producers to
 alleviate the economic emergency.
 `(ii) ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary may make such adjustments in the amount of
 payments made available under this paragraph with respect to an individual
 farm as necessary to ensure the equitable allotment of the payments among
 producers, taking into account other forms of Federal disaster assistance
 provided to the producers for the crop involved.
 `(d) PAYMENT YIELDS- The farm program payment yields for farms for each
 crop of rice shall be determined under title V.
 `(e) Acreage Reduction Programs-
 `(1) In general-
 `(A) ESTABLISHMENT- Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if
 the Secretary determines that the total supply of rice, in the absence of
 an acreage limitation program, will be excessive taking into account the
 need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable supplies
 and prices and to meet a national emergency, the Secretary may provide for
 any crop of rice an acreage limitation program as described in paragraph (2).
 `(B) AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION PROGRAM- In making a determination
 under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into consideration the
 number of acres placed in the agricultural resources conservation program
 established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985
 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et seq.).

 program for any crop year, the Secretary shall announce any such program not
 later than January 31 of the calendar year in which the crop is harvested,
 except that in the case of the 1991 crop, the Secretary shall announce the
 program as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this section.
 `(D) CARRY-OVER- The Secretary shall carry out an acreage limitation program
 described in paragraph (2) for a crop of rice in a manner that will result
 in carry-over stocks equal to 16.5 to 20 percent of the simple average of
 the total disappearance of rice for each of the 3 marketing years preceding
 the year for which the announcement is made. For the purpose of this
 subparagraph, the term `total disappearance' means all rice utilization,
 including total domestic, total export, and total residual disappearance.
 `(2) Acreage limitation program-
 `(A) PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONS- Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a
 rice acreage limitation program is announced under paragraph (1), such
 limitation shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction
 (from 0 to 35 percent) to the rice crop acreage base for the crop for each
 rice-producing farm.
 `(B) COMPLIANCE- Except as provided in section 504, producers who knowingly
 produce rice in excess of the permitted rice acreage for the farm, as
 established in accordance with subparagraph (A), shall be ineligible for
 rice loans, purchases, and payments with respect to that farm.
 `(C) CROP ACREAGE BASES- Rice crop acreage bases for each crop of rice
 shall be determined under title V.
 `(D) ACREAGE DEVOTED TO CONSERVATION USES- A number of acres on the farm
 shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued
 by the Secretary. Such number shall be determined by multiplying the rice
 crop acreage base by the percentage reduction required by the Secretary. The
 number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as
 `reduced acreage'. The remaining acreage is hereafter in this subsection
 referred to as `permitted acreage'. Permitted acreage may be adjusted by
 the Secretary as provided in paragraph (3) and in section 504.
 `(E) INDIVIDUAL FARM PROGRAM ACREAGE- Except as otherwise provided in
 subsection (c), the individual farm program acreage shall be the acreage
 planted on the farm to rice for harvest within the permitted rice acreage

 on a farm to plant a designated crop on no more than one-half of the reduced
 acreage on the farm.
 `(iii) LIMITATIONS- If the producers on a farm elect to plant a designated
 crop on reduced acreage under this subparagraph--
 `(I) the amount of the deficiency payment that the producers are otherwise
 eligible to receive under subsection (c) shall be reduced, for each acre
 (or portion thereof) that is planted to the designated crop, by an amount
 equal to the deficiency payment that would be made with respect to a
 number of acres of the crop that the Secretary considers appropriate,
 except that if the producers on the farm are participating in a program
 established for more than one program crop, the amount of the reduction
 shall be determined by prorating the reduction based on the acreage planted
 or considered planted on the farm to all of such program crops; and
 `(II) the Secretary shall ensure that reductions in deficiency payments
 under subclause (I) are sufficient to ensure that this subparagraph will
 result in no additional cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
 `(3) Targeted option payments-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if
 the Secretary implements an acreage limitation program with respect to any
 of the 1991 through 1995 crops of rice and announces an acreage limitation
 percentage of 20 percent or less, the Secretary may make available to
 producers on a farm who do not receive payments under subsection (c)(1)(D)
 for such crop on the farm, adjustments in the level of deficiency payments
 that would otherwise be made available to the producers if the producers
 exercise the payment options provided in this paragraph.
 `(B) PAYMENT OPTIONS- If the Secretary elects to carry out this paragraph,
 the Secretary shall make the payment options specified in subparagraphs

 payments to be made available to producers who participate in the program
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall increase the established price
 for rice by an amount determined by the Secretary, but not less than 0.5
 percent, nor more than 1 percent, for each 1 percentage point increase in
 the acreage limitation percentage applied to the producers' rice acreage base.
 `(iii) LIMITATION- The acreage limitation percentage to be applied to the
 producers' rice acreage base shall not be increased by more than 5 percentage
 points above the acreage limitation percentage announced by the Secretary.
 `(iv) ADJUSTMENT FOR UNDERPLANTINGS- In determining the increased acreage
 limitation percentage that is applied to the producer's rice acreage base
 under this paragraph, the Secretary shall exclude an amount of acreage equal
 to the average difference between the producer's permitted rice acreage and

 `(b) Farm Poundage Quotas-
 `(1) In general-
 `(A) ESTABLISHMENT- A farm poundage quota for each of the 1991 through 1995
 marketing years shall be established--
 `(i) for each farm that had a farm poundage quota for peanuts for the 1990
 marketing year;
 `(ii) if the poundage quota apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3)
 for any such marketing year is larger than the quota for the immediately
 preceding marketing year, for each other farm on which peanuts were produced
 for marketing in at least 2 of the 3 immediately preceding crop years,
 as determined by the Secretary; and
 `(iii) as approved and determined by the Secretary under section 358c,
 for each farm on which peanuts are produced in connection with experimental
 and research programs.
 `(B) QUANTITY- The farm poundage quota for each of the 1991 through 1995
 marketing years for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be the
 same as the farm poundage quota for the farm for the immediately preceding
 marketing year, as adjusted under paragraph (2), but not including--
 `(i) any increases for undermarketings from previous years; or
 `(ii) any increases resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily
 released for 1 year under paragraph (7).
The farm poundage quota, if any, for each of the 1991 through 1995 marketing
years for each farm described in subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be equal to the
quantity of peanuts allocated to the farm for the year under paragraph (2).
 `(C) TRANSFERS- For purposes of this subsection, if the farm poundage quota,

 subsequent marketing years.
 `(2) Adjustments-
 `(A) ALLOCATION OF INCREASED QUOTA GENERALLY- Except as provided in
 subparagraph (B) and subject to subparagraph (D), if the poundage quota
 apportioned to a State under subsection (a)(3) for any of the 1991 through
 1995 marketing years is increased over the poundage quota apportioned
 to farms in the State for the immediately preceding marketing year, the
 increase shall be allocated proportionately, based on farm production
 history for peanuts for the 3 immediately preceding years, among--
 `(i) all farms in the State for each of which a farm poundage quota was
 established for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year
 for which the allocation is being made; and
 `(ii) all other farms in the State on each of which peanuts were produced
 in at least 2 of the 3 immediately preceding crop years, as determined by
 the Secretary.
 `(B) Allocation of increased quota in texas-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- In Texas, and subject to terms and conditions prescribed
 by the Secretary, beginning with the 1991 marketing year, 33 percent of the
 increased quota referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to farms
 having poundage quotas for the 1990 marketing year in any county in which
 the production of additional peanuts exceeded the total quota allocated to
 the county for the 1989 marketing year.
 `(ii) BASIS FOR ALLOCATION TO COUNTIES- The allocation of the quota to
 eligible counties shall be based on the total production of additional
 peanuts in the respective counties for the 1988 crop, except that the
 total quota allocated to any county under this subparagraph and paragraph
 (6)(C) shall not be increased by more than 100 percent of the basic quota
 assigned to the county for the 1989 marketing year if that county had more
 than 10,000 tons of quota for the 1989 marketing year.

 is so increased by 100 percent, all of the remaining quota percentage set
 aside under this subparagraph shall be allocated to farms in other counties
 otherwise meeting the requirements of this subparagraph.
 `(iv) ALLOCATION TO ELIGIBLE FARMS- The percentage of increased quota in
 any county shall be allocated under this subparagraph only to quota farms
 from which additional peanuts were delivered under contract with handlers
 for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which
 the allocation is being made. The percentage of the increased quota in
 each county shall be allocated among the eligible farms in the county on
 the following basis:
 `(I) FACTOR- A factor shall be established for each such eligible farm by
 dividing the quantity of additional peanuts contracted and delivered to
 handlers from the farm by the total remaining peanuts produced on the farm
 for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which
 the allocation is being made.
 `(II) ALLOCATION- Each such eligible farm shall be allocated the percentage
 of the increased quota for the county as its factor bears to the total of
 the factors for all eligible farms in the county.
 `(v) REMAINING PERCENTAGE- In Texas, the remaining 67 percent of the increased
 quota referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to farms in the
 State in accordance with subparagraph (A).

 (a)(3) for any of the 1991 through 1995 marketing years is decreased from
 the poundage quota apportioned to farms in the State under subsection (a)(3)
 for the immediately preceding marketing year, the decrease shall be allocated
 among all the farms in the State for each of which a farm poundage quota
 was established for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing
 year for which the allocation is being made.
 `(D) SPECIAL RULE ON TENANT'S SHARE OF INCREASED QUOTA- Subject to terms
 and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, on farms that were leased to a
 tenant for peanut production, the tenant shall share equally with the owner
 of the farm in that percentage of the quota referred to in subparagraph (A)
 and otherwise allocated to the farm as the result of the tenant's production
 on the farm of additional peanuts. Not later than April 1 of each year or as
 soon as practicable, the tenant's share of any such quota shall be allocated
 to a farm within the county owned by the tenant or sold by the tenant to
 the owner of any farm within the county and permanently transferred to that
 farm. Any quota not so disposed of as provided in this subparagraph shall be
 allocated to other quota farms in the State under paragraph (6) as part of the
 quota reduced from farms in the State due to the failure to produce the quota.
 `(3) Quota not produced-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Insofar as practicable and on such fair and equitable
 basis as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, the farm poundage quota
 established for a farm for any of the 1991 through 1995 marketing years
 shall be reduced to the extent that the Secretary determines that the farm
 poundage quota established for the farm for any 2 of the 3 marketing years
 preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made was
 not produced, or considered produced, on the farm.
 `(B) EXCLUSIONS- For the purposes of this paragraph, the farm poundage
 quota for any such preceding marketing year shall not include--
 `(i) any increases for undermarketing of quota peanuts from previous years; or
 `(ii) any increase resulting from the allocation of quotas voluntarily
 released for 1 year under paragraph (7).
 `(4) QUOTA CONSIDERED PRODUCED- For purposes of this subsection, the farm
 poundage quota shall be considered produced on a farm if--
 `(A) the farm poundage quota was not produced on the farm because of drought,
 flood, or any other natural disaster, or any other condition beyond the
 control of the producer, as determined by the Secretary;
 `(B) the farm poundage quota for the farm was released voluntarily under
 paragraph (7) for only 1 of the 3 marketing years immediately preceding
 the marketing year for which the determination is being made; or
 `(C) the farm poundage quota was leased to another owner or operator of
 a farm within the same county for transfer to such farm for only 1 of the
 3 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the
 determination is being made.
 `(5) QUOTA PERMANENTLY RELEASED- Notwithstanding any other provision of law--
 `(A) the farm poundage quota established for a farm under this subsection,
 or any part of the quota, may be permanently released by the owner of the
 farm, or the operator with the permission of the owner; and
 `(B) the poundage quota for the farm for which the quota is released shall
 be adjusted downward to reflect the quota that is so released.
 `(6) Allocation of quotas reduced or released-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the total
 quantity of the farm poundage quotas reduced or voluntarily released from
 farms in a State for any marketing year under paragraphs (3) and (5) shall
 be allocated, as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, to other farms
 in the State on which peanuts were produced in at least 2 of the 3 crop
 years immediately preceding the year for which the allocation is being made.
 `(B) SET-ASIDE FOR FARMS WITH NO QUOTA- Not more than 25 percent of the total
 amount of farm poundage quota to be allocated in the State under subparagraph
 (A) shall be allocated to farms in the State for which no farm poundage quota
 was established for the immediately preceding year's crop.  The allocation to
 any such farm shall not exceed the average farm production of peanuts for the
 3 immediately preceding years during which peanuts were produced on the farm.
 `(C) Allocation of quotas reduced or released in texas-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- In Texas, and subject to terms and conditions prescribed by
 the Secretary, beginning with the 1991 marketing year, the total quantity
 of the farm poundage quota, except the percentage allocated to new farms
 under subparagraph (B), shall be allocated to other farms having poundage
 quotas for the 1990 marketing year in all counties in which the production
 of additional peanuts exceeded the total quota allocated to the county for
 the 1989 marketing year.
 `(ii) BASIS FOR ALLOCATION TO COUNTIES- The allocation of the quota to
 eligible counties shall be based on the total production of additional
 peanuts in the respective county for the 1988 crop, except that the total
 quota allocated to any county under this subparagraph and paragraph (2)(B)
 shall not be increased by more than 100 percent of the basic quota allocated
 to the county for the 1989 marketing year, if that county had more than
 10,000 tons of quota for the 1989 marketing year.
 `(iii) ALLOCATION TO OTHER COUNTIES- If the total quota for any such county
 is so increased by 100 percent, all of the remaining quota set aside under
 this subparagraph shall be allocated to farms in other counties otherwise
 meeting the requirements of this subparagraph.
 `(iv) ALLOCATION TO ELIGIBLE FARMS- The percentage of farm poundage quota
 available for allocation under this subparagraph shall be allocated only to
 quota farms from which additional peanuts were delivered under contract with
 handlers for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year
 for which the allocation is being made. The percentage of the increased
 quota in each county shall be allocated among the eligible farms in the
 county on the following basis:
 `(I) FACTOR- A factor shall be established for each such eligible farm
 by dividing the amount of additional peanuts contracted and delivered to
 handlers from the farm by the total remaining peanuts produced on the farm
 for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketing year for which
 the allocation is being made.
 `(II) ALLOCATION- Each such eligible farm shall be allocated the percentage
 of the increased quota for the county as its factor bears to the total of
 the factors for all eligible farms in the county.
 `(7) Quota temporarily released-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- The farm poundage quota, or any portion thereof, established
 for a farm for a marketing year may be voluntarily released to the Secretary
 to the extent that the quota, or any part thereof, will not be produced on
 the farm for the marketing year. Any farm poundage quota so released in a
 State shall be allocated to other farms in the State on such basis as the
 Secretary may by regulation prescribe.
 `(B) EFFECTIVE PERIOD- Except as otherwise provided in this section, any
 adjustment in the farm poundage quota for a farm under subparagraph (A)
 shall be effective only for the marketing year for which it is made and shall
 not be taken into consideration in establishing a farm poundage quota for
 the farm from which the quota was released for any subsequent marketing year.
 `(8) Increase for undermarketings in previous marketing years-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the farm poundage
 quota for a farm for any marketing year shall be increased by the number of
 pounds by which the total marketings of quota peanuts from the farm during
 previous marketing years (excluding any marketing year before the marketing
 year for the 1989 crop) were less than the total amount of applicable farm
 poundage quotas (disregarding adjustments for undermarketings from previous
 marketing years) for the marketing years.
 `(B) QUOTA NOT PRODUCED- For purposes of subparagraph (A), no increase for
 undermarketings in previous marketing years shall be made to the poundage
 quota for any farm to the extent that the poundage quota for the farm for
 the marketing year was reduced under paragraph (3) for failure to produce.
 `(C) NATIONAL POUNDAGE QUOTA- Any increases in farm poundage quotas under
 this paragraph shall not be counted against the national poundage quota
 for the marketing year involved.
 `(D) TRANSFER OF ADDITIONAL PEANUTS- Any increase in the farm poundage quota
 for a farm for a marketing year under this paragraph may be used during the
 marketing year by the transfer of additional peanuts produced on the farm
 to the quota loan pool for pricing purposes on such basis as the Secretary
 shall by regulation prescribe.
 `(9) LIMIT ON INCREASES FOR UNDERMARKETINGS- Notwithstanding the foregoing
 provisions of this subsection, if the total of all increases in individual
 farm poundage quotas under paragraph (8) exceeds 10 percent of the national
 poundage quota for the marketing year in which the increases shall be
 applicable, the Secretary shall adjust the increases so that the total of
 all the increases does not exceed 10 percent of the national poundage quota.
 `(c) Farm Yields-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- For each farm for which a farm poundage quota is established
 under subsection (b), and when necessary for purposes of this Act, a farm
 yield of peanuts shall be determined for each such farm.
 `(2) QUANTITY- The yield shall be equal to the average of the actual yield
 per acre on the farm for each of the 3 crop years in which yields were
 highest on the farm out of the 5 crop years 1973 through 1977.
 `(3) APPRAISED YIELDS- If peanuts were not produced on the farm in at least
 3 years during the 5-year period or there was a substantial change in the
 operation of the farm during the period (including a change in operator,
 lessee who is an operator, or irrigation practices), the Secretary shall
 have a yield appraised for the farm. The appraised yield shall be that
 quantity determined to be fair and reasonable on the basis of yields
 established for similar farms that are located in the area of the farm and
 on which peanuts were produced, taking into consideration land, labor, and
 equipment available for the production of peanuts, crop rotation practices,
 soil and water, and other relevant factors.
 `(d) Referendum Respecting Poundage Quotas-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- Not later than December 15 of each calendar year, the
 Secretary shall conduct a referendum of producers engaged in the production
 of quota peanuts in the calendar year in which the referendum is held
 to determine whether the producers are in favor of or opposed to poundage
 quotas with respect to the crops of peanuts produced in the 5 calendar years
 immediately following the year in which the referendum is held, except that,
 if as many as two-thirds of the producers voting in any referendum vote
 in favor of poundage quotas, no referendum shall be held with respect to

 under section 108B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 and not redeemed by
 the producers;
 `(ii) marketed through an area marketing association designated pursuant

 the producer through an agent, the penalty shall be paid by the agent. The
 person or agent may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the
 price paid to the producer.
 `(3) FAILURE TO COLLECT- If the person required to collect the penalty fails
 to collect the penalty, the person and all persons entitled to share in the
 peanuts marketed from the farm or the proceeds thereof shall be jointly
 and severally liable with such persons who failed to collect the penalty
 for the amount of the penalty.
 `(4) APPLICATION OF QUOTA- Peanuts produced in a calendar year in which
 farm poundage quotas are in effect for the marketing year beginning therein

 violation of permissible uses of quota and additional peanuts. Any penalty
 payable under this paragraph shall be paid and remitted by the producer.
 `(6) UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS- The Secretary shall authorize, under such
 regulations as the Secretary shall issue, the county committees established
 under section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16

 having the grade, kernel content, and quality of the quota peanuts acquired
 by the handler from the crop for the marketing, the handler shall be subject
 to a penalty equal to 140 percent of the loan level for quota peanuts on
 the quantity of peanuts that the Secretary determines are in excess of the
 quantity, grade, or quality of the peanuts that could reasonably have been
 produced from the peanuts so acquired.

 under section 359c(f) and there are in excess of 250 producers in such State,
 the Secretary shall make a determination under subparagraph (B).
 `(B) DETERMINATION- The Secretary shall determine, for each State allotment
 described in subparagraph (A), whether the production of sugar, in the absence
 of proportionate shares, will be greater than the quantity needed to enable
 processors to fill the allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory.
 `(2) ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPORTIONATE SHARES- If the Secretary determines under
 paragraph (1) that the quantity of sugar processed from all crops by all
 processors covered by a State allotment for a fiscal year will be in excess of
 the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the allotment for the fiscal
 year and provide a normal carryover inventory, the Secretary shall establish
 proportionate shares for the crop of sugarcane that is harvested during the
 fiscal year the allotment is in effect as provided in this subsection. Each
 such proportionate share shall be subject to adjustment under section 359c(g).
 `(3) METHOD OF DETERMINING- For purposes of determining proportionate shares
 for any crop of sugarcane:
 `(A) The Secretary shall establish the State's per-acre yield goal for a
 crop at a level (not less than the average per-acre yield in the State for
 the preceding 5 years, as determined by the Secretary) that will ensure
 an adequate net return per pound to producers in the State, taking into
 consideration any available production research data that the Secretary
 deems relevant.
 `(B) The Secretary shall convert the State allotment for the fiscal year
 involved into a State acreage allotment for the crop by dividing the State
 allotment by the per-acre yield goal for the State, as established under
 subparagraph (A).
 `(C) The Secretary shall establish a uniform reduction percentage for the
 crop by dividing the State acreage allotment, as determined for the crop
 under subparagraph (B), by the sum of all acreage bases in the State, as
 determined by the Secretary, that the Secretary estimates would otherwise
 be harvested for the production of the crop of sugarcane.
 `(D) The uniform reduction percentage for the crop, as determined under
 subparagraph (C), shall be applied to the acreage base for each farm covered
 by the State allotment to determine the farm's proportionate share for
 the crop.
 `(4) ACREAGE BASE- For purposes of this subsection, the acreage base for each
 sugarcane-producing farm shall be determined by the Secretary, as follows:
 `(A) The acreage base for any crop shall be the number of acres that is equal
 to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted for harvest for
 sugar or seed on the farm in each of the 5 crop years preceding the crop year.
 `(B) Acreage that producers on a farm were unable to harvest to sugarcane
 for sugar or seed because of drought, flood, other natural disaster, or
 other condition beyond the control of the producers shall be considered as
 harvested to sugarcane for sugar or seed for purposes of this paragraph.
 `(5) VIOLATION-
 `(A) IN GENERAL- Whenever proportionate shares are in effect in a State
 for a crop of sugarcane, no producer in the State knowingly may harvest for
 sugar or seed an acreage of sugarcane of the crop in excess of the farm's
 proportionate share for the crop or otherwise violate proportionate share
 regulations issued by the Secretary under section 359h(a).
 `(B) CIVIL PENALTY- Any producer who violates subparagraph (A) shall be liable
 to the Commodity Credit Corporation for a civil penalty in an amount equal
 to 3 times the United States market value, at the time of the commission
 of the violation, of that quantity of sugar involved in the violation. The
 quantity of sugar involved shall be determined based on the per-acre yield
 goal established under paragraph (3).
 `(6) WAIVER- Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the Secretary may
 authorize the county and State committees established under section 8(b)
 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b))
 to waive or modify deadlines and other proportionate share requirements in
 cases in which lateness or failure to meet the other requirements does not
 affect adversely the operation of proportionate shares.
`SEC. 359g. SPECIAL RULES.
 `(a) TRANSFER OF PRODUCTION HISTORY- For the purpose of establishing
 proportionate shares for producers under section 359f, the Secretary, on
 application of any producer, may transfer the production history of land
 owned, operated, or controlled by the producers to any other parcels of
 land of the applicant.
 `(b) RESERVATION OF PRODUCTION HISTORY- If for reasons beyond the control
 of an owner of a farm, the owner is unable to use all or a portion of the
 proportionate share established for the farm under section 359f, the Secretary
 may reserve for a period of not more than 3 consecutive years the production
 history of the farm to the extent of the proportionate share involved. The
 proportionate share may be redistributed to other farm owners or operators,
 but no production history shall accrue to the other farm owners or operators,
 by virtue of the redistribution of the proportionate share so redistributed.
 `(c) REVISIONS OF ALLOCATIONS AND PROPORTIONATE SHARES- The Secretary, after
 such hearing and notice as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe, may
 revise or amend any allocation of a marketing allotment under section 359d,
 or any proportionate share established for a farm under section 359f, on the
 same basis as the initial allocation or proportionate share was established.

 `(B) EXCEPTION-
 `(i) 1991 CROPS- In the case of each of the 1991 crops of upland cotton
 and rice, if the producers on a farm did not participate in the production
 adjustment program established for the 1989 and 1990 crops of upland cotton
 and rice, respectively, the crop acreage base for the 1991 crop shall be
 equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted to such
 crop for harvest on the farm in each of the 5 crop years preceding the 1991
 crop year, excluding all crop years in which planted and considered planted
 acreage was not established for the farm. Any crop acreage base established
 in accordance with this subparagraph shall not exceed a number of acres equal

 the Secretary determines should be considered in determining a fair and
 equitable crop acreage base, including adjustments necessary to enable
 producers to meet the requirements of title XII of the Food Security Act
 of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.).
 `(f) PREVENTED PLANTING- If a county committee determines, in accordance
 with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the occurrence of a
 natural disaster or other similar condition beyond the control of the
 producer prevented the planting of a program crop on any farm within the
 county (or substantially destroyed any such program crop after it had been
 planted but before it had been harvested), the producer may plant any other
 crop, including any other program crop, on the acreage of such farm that,
 but for the occurrence of such disaster or other condition, would have been
 devoted to the production of a program crop. For purposes of determining
 the crop acreage base, any acreage on the farm on which a substitute crop,
 including any program crop, is planted under this subsection shall be taken
 into account as if such acreage had been planted to the program crop for
 which the other crop was substituted.

 payment for any program crop or crop of extra long staple cotton in any crop
 year with respect to a farm may not use the acreage planted or considered
 planted to any program crop or crop of extra long staple cotton on the farm
 in the crop year to increase any crop acreage base established for the farm
 in a subsequent crop year.
 `(h) ADJUSTMENT OF BASES- The county committee, in accordance with regulations
 prescribed by the Secretary, may adjust any crop acreage base for any program
 crop for any farm if the crop acreage base for the crop on the farm would
 otherwise be adversely affected by a condition or occurrence beyond the
 control of the producer.
`SEC. 504. PLANTING FLEXIBILITY.
 `(a) IN GENERAL- The producers on a farm may, in accordance with this section,
 plant for harvest on the crop acreage base established for a program crop

 of the nonrecourse loan level for soybeans established in section 205 if
 soybeans were allowed to be planted on up to 25 percent of the crop acreage
 base under this section, the quantity of the crop acreage base that may
 be planted to soybeans under this section may not exceed 15 percent of the
 crop acreage base.
 `(d) PLANTINGS IN EXCESS OF PERMITTED ACREAGE- Notwithstanding any other
 provision of this Act, producers of a program crop who are participating
 in the production adjustment program for that program crop under this Act
 shall be allowed to plant that program crop in a quantity that exceeds the
 permitted acreage for that crop without losing their eligibility for loans,
 purchases, or payments with respect to that crop under this Act if--

 for the 1990 crop year for the farm.
 `(2) ADDITIONAL YIELD PAYMENTS- In the case of each of the 1991 through 1995
 crop years for a commodity, if the farm program payment yield for a farm is
 reduced more than 10 percent below the farm program payment yield for the
 1985 crop year, the Secretary shall make available to producers established
 price payments for the commodity in such amount as the Secretary determines
 is necessary to provide the same total return to producers as if the farm
 program payment yield had not been reduced more than 10 percent below the
 farm program payment yield for the 1985 crop year. The payments shall be
 made available not later than the time final deficiency payments are made.
 `(3) NO CROP OR YIELD AVAILABLE- If no crop of the commodity was produced
 on the farm or no farm program payment yield was established for the farm
 for any of the 1981 through 1985 crop years (or, as appropriate, the 1986
 through 1990 crop years), the farm program payment yield shall be established
 on the basis of the average farm program payment yield for the crop years
 for similar farms in the area.
 `(4) NATIONAL, STATE, OR COUNTY YIELDS- If the Secretary determines the
 action is necessary, the Secretary may establish national, State, or county
 program payment yields on the basis of--
 `(A) historical yields, as adjusted by the Secretary to correct for abnormal
 factors affecting the yields in the historical period; or
 `(B) the Secretary's estimate of actual yields for the crop year involved
 if historical yield data is not available.
 `(5) BALANCING YIELDS- If national, State, or county program payment
 yields are established, the farm program payment yields shall balance to
 the national, State, or county program payment yields.

 `(1) the number of acres so affected but not to exceed the acreage planted
 to peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets, or sugarcane for harvest (including any
 acreage that the producers were prevented from planting to the commodity
 or to other nonconserving crops in lieu of peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets,

 established by the Secretary for the crop by the acreage planted for harvest
 for the crop, the Secretary may make a reduced yield disaster payment to

 be equal to the level of support determined as provided in this Act.
 `(b) ADJUSTMENT IN SUPPORT PRICES FOR COTTON- The Secretary may make
 appropriate adjustments in the support price for cotton for differences in
 quality factors and location. Beginning with the 1991 crop, the quality
 differences (premiums and discounts for quality factors) for the upland
 cotton loan program shall be established by the Secretary by giving equal
 weight to (1) loan differences for the preceding crop, and (2) market
 differences for such crop in the designated United States spot markets.
 `(c) LIMITATION ON ADJUSTMENTS FOR WHEAT AND FEED GRAINS- Notwithstanding
 any other provision of this section, for each of the 1990 through 1995

SEC. 1212. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.
 Section 2 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 2101) is amended to read as follows:
`SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.
 `(a) FINDINGS- Congress finds that--
 `(1) most of the productive forest land of the United States is in private,
 State, and local governmental ownership, and the capacity of the United
 States to produce renewable forest resources is significantly dependent on
 such non-Federal forest lands;
 `(2) adequate supplies of timber and other forest resources are essential
 to the United States, and adequate supplies are dependent on efficient
 methods for establishing, managing, and harvesting trees and processing,
 marketing, and using wood and wood products;
 `(3) nearly one-half of the wood supply of the United States comes from
 nonindustrial private timberlands and such percentage could rise with
 expanded assistance programs;
 `(4) managed forest lands provide habitats for fish and wildlife, as well
 as aesthetics, outdoor recreation opportunities, and other forest resources;
 `(5) the soil, water, and air quality of the United States can be maintained
 and improved through good stewardship of privately held forest resources;
 `(6) insects and diseases affecting trees occur and sometimes create emergency
 conditions on all land, whether Federal or non-Federal, and efforts to
 prevent and control such insects and diseases often require coordinated
 action by both Federal and non-Federal land managers;
 `(7) fires in rural areas threaten human lives, property, forests and
 other resources, and Federal-State cooperation in forest fire protection
 has proven effective and valuable;
 `(8) trees and forests are of great environmental and economic value to
 urban areas;
 `(9) managed forests contribute to improving the quality, quantity, and
 timing of water yields that are of broad benefit to society;
 `(10) over half the forest lands of the United States are in need of some
 type of conservation treatment;
 `(11) forest landowners are being faced with increased pressure to convert
 their forest land to development and other purposes;
 `(12) increased population pressures and user demands are being placed
 on private, as well as public, landholders to provide a wide variety
 of products and services, including fish and wildlife habitat, aesthetic
 quality, and recreational opportunities;
 `(13) stewardship of privately held forest resources requires a long-term
 commitment that can be fostered through local, State, and Federal governmental
 actions;
 `(14) the Department of Agriculture, through the coordinated efforts
 of its agencies with forestry responsibilities, cooperating with other
 Federal agencies, State foresters, and State political subdivisions, has
 the expertise and experience to assist private landowners in achieving
 individual goals and public benefits regarding forestry;
 `(15) the products and services resulting from nonindustrial private
 forest land stewardship provide income and employment that contribute to
 the economic health and diversity of rural communities; and
 `(16) sustainable agroforestry systems and tree planting in semiarid lands
 can improve environmental quality and maintain farm yields and income.
 `(b) PURPOSE- It is the purpose of this Act to authorize the Secretary of
 Agriculture (hereafter in this Act referred to as the `Secretary'), with
 respect to non-Federal forest lands of the United States, to assist in--
 `(1) the establishment of a coordinated and cooperative Federal, State,
 and local forest stewardship program for management of the non-Federal
 forest lands;
 `(2) the encouragement of the production of timber;
 `(3) the prevention and control of insects and diseases affecting trees
 and forests;
 `(4) the prevention and control of rural fires;
 `(5) the efficient utilization of wood and wood residues, including the
 recycling of wood fiber;
 `(6) the improvement and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat;
 `(7) the planning and conduct of urban forestry programs;
 `(8) broadening existing forest management, fire protection, and insect
 and disease protection programs on non-Federal forest lands to meet the
 multiple use objectives of landowners in an environmentally sensitive manner;
 `(9) providing opportunities to private landowners to protect ecologically
 valuable and threatened non-Federal forest lands; and
 `(10) strengthening educational, technical, and financial assistance programs
 that provide assistance to owners of non-Federal forest lands.
 `(c) POLICY- It is the policy of Congress that it is in the national interest
 for the Secretary to work through and in cooperation with State foresters,
 or equivalent State officials, nongovernmental organizations, and the private
 sector in implementing Federal programs affecting non-Federal forest lands.
 `(d) CONSTRUCTION- This Act shall be construed to complement the policies
 and direction under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning
 Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.).'.

 provisions of title I of the Agricultural Act of 1949, acreage devoted to
 resource-conserving crops as part of a resource-conserving crop rotation
 under this program may also be designated as conservation use acreage for
 the purpose of fulfilling any provisions under any acreage limitation or land
 diversion program and up to 50 percent of the acreage so designated shall be
 without restrictions on haying and grazing, except as provided in paragraph
 (5)(B), except that such acreage that is devoted to perennial cover on which
 cost-share assistance for the establishment of the perennial cover has been
 provided, shall not be credited towards the producer's resource-conserving
 crop requirement under a contract under this section.

 producer who is otherwise eligible to receive with respect to acreage enrolled
 in the program if such producer hays or grazes such acreage (excluding
 acreage designated as conservation use acreage) during the 5-month period
 in each State during which haying and grazing of conserving use acres is
 not allowed under the provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949, or,
 if the crop planted on such acreage includes a small grain, before the
 producer harvests the small grain crop in kernel form.
 (B) LIMITATION ON PERMITTED HAYING AND GRAZING- Notwithstanding any other
 provision of this section, if the Secretary determines that implementation
 of this section will result in a significant adverse economic impact on hay
 or livestock prices in a particular geographic area, the Secretary may limit
 the quantity of hay that can be harvested or grazed from that area. Such limit
 may include restrictions on the number of times that hay may be harvested or
 grazed from the acres per year, the timing of such harvesting and grazing,
 or the number of years that such land may remain in the same hay stand,
 or a prohibition on the harvesting or grazing of hay from acres on which a
 small grain was not originally interplanted with the hay crop and harvested
 for grain.
 (6) BASE ACRE ADJUSTMENTS- The Secretary, only for the purpose of establishing
 a producer's crop acreage base under the Agricultural Act of 1949, may make
 such adjustments as the Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to
 reflect resource-conserving crop rotation practices that were maintained by
 producers prior to participation in the program and to reflect such other
 factors as the Secretary determines should be considered, except that the
 total of such adjustments in any year shall not exceed the total farm program
 savings in the same year that would result from the implementation of plans.

 (A) IN GENERAL- No producers enrolled in a resource-conserving crop rotation
 shall not be eligible to receive payments under farm programs for wheat,
 feed grains, cotton, or rice under the Agricultural Act of 1949 on acreage
 equal to the average number of traditionally underplanted acres for the
 three years prior to enrolling in this program.
 (B) DEFINITION-
 (i) IN GENERAL- Subject to clause (ii), for the purposes of this paragraph
 the term `traditionally underplanted acreage' means the difference in
 a particular year between the acreage that is part of a producer's crop
 acreage base that is not planted to the program crop and the part of the
 crop acreage base subject to an acreage limitation program or required to
 be set aside. In no case shall such acreage be less than zero.
 (ii) EXCEPTION- In the case of a producer participating in a particular year
 in a program authorized under section 101B(c)(1)(B), section 103B(c)(1)(B),
 section 105A(c)(1)(B), or section 107A(c)(1)(B) of the Agricultural Act of
 1949, the term `traditionally underplanted acreage' means 8 percent of the
 producer's permitted acreage for such year.
