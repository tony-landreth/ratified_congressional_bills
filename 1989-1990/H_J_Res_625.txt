H.J.Res.625
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating August 6, 1990, as `Voting Rights Celebration Day'.
Whereas the 15th amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the
right of all citizens of the United States to vote without regard to their
race or color;
Whereas, for nearly a century, the Government of the United States failed
to enforce effectively the 15th amendment, thus denying African-Americans
the right to exercise their voting franchise;
Whereas, in the absence of voting rights legislation, violence, harassment,
intimidation, unfair tests, and other barriers to participation denied
millions of United States citizens empowerment and enfranchisement in the
political process;
Whereas the enactment of effective voting rights legislation was a priority
of the civil rights movement for which many gave their lives;
Whereas President Lyndon Johnson declared on March 15, 1965, before a Joint
Session of Congress that `every American citizen must have an equal right
to vote,' and that `there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than
the duty we have to insure that right';
Whereas bipartisan majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate
overwhelmingly approved the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and President Johnson
signed the Act into law in a ceremony in the rotunda of the United States
Capitol on August 6, 1965;
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been the most effective civil rights
legislation for changing discriminatory practices that denied African-American,
Hispanic-American, Native-American, Asian-American and other minority voters
their most basic democratic rights, the right to vote and the opportunity
to elect the persons they most want to represent them;
Whereas Congress has extended the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on three
occasions because of its great effectiveness in expanding voter registration
among minority citizens, increasing the number of African-American,
Hispanic-American, Native-American, Asian-American and other minority elected
officials, and causing greater and intrinsically valuable discourse between
candidates for elective office and voters of all races and colors; and
Whereas August 6, 1990, marks the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That August 6, 1990, is designated as `Voting
 Rights Celebration Day', and the President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation reminding the people of the United States of--
 (1) the historic struggle to provide all citizens of the United States with
 an equal and unencumbered right to vote;
 (2) the need to register to vote and participate in elections;
 (3) the importance of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the need for its
 continued enforcement; and
 (4) the value of the vote to all citizens as an instrument of self-government
 and justice in a democratic society.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
