Joint Resolution
To designate the second Sunday in October of 1990 as `National Children's Day'.
Whereas the people of the United States should celebrate children as the
most valuable asset of the Nation;
Whereas children represent the future, hope, and inspiration of the United
States;
Whereas the children of the United States should not be allowed to feel that
their ideas and dreams will be stifled because adults in the United States
do not take time to listen;
Whereas many children face crises of grave proportions, especially as they
enter adolescent years;
Whereas it is important for parents to spend time listening to their children
on a daily basis;
Whereas modern societal and economic demands often pull the family apart;
Whereas encouragement should be given to families to set aside a special
time for all family members to remain at home;
Whereas adults in the United States should have an opportunity to reminisce
on their youth to recapture some of the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams
that they may have lost through the years;
Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the children of the United
States will provide an opportunity to emphasize to children the importance
of developing an ability to make the choices necessary to distance themselves
from impropriety;
Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the children of the Nation
will emphasize to the people of the United States the importance of the role
of the child within the family;
Whereas the people of the United States should emphasize to children the
importance of family life, education, and spiritual qualities; and
Whereas parents, teachers, and community and religious leaders should celebrate
the children of the United States, whose questions, laughter, and tears are
important to the existence of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the second Sunday in October of 1990
 is designated as `National Children's Day', and the President of the United
 States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the
 people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
