AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating October 25, 1989, as `National Arab-American Day'.
Whereas the rich history and tradition of Arab culture has contributed to
western civilization in many fields, including science, medicine, geography,
and architecture;
Whereas the contributions made by Arab culture transcend geographic, political,
and religious classification;
Whereas Arab-Americans have made, and continue to make, important contributions
to the economic prosperity and cultural life of our Nation since October 1854,
when the first recorded Arab immigrant arrived in the United States;
Whereas the term `Arab' represents a people who are followers of the 3 great
monotheistic religions and are bound by the common language of Arabic;
Whereas Arabs are of one origin, but are citizens of many countries;
Whereas Arab-Americans have worked hard since their arrival and have been
productive United States citizens; and
Whereas the people of the United States should always remember that there
are almost 3,000,000 Arab-Americans who are a part of the mosaic of cultures
of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 25, 1989, is designated as
 `National Arab-American Day'. The President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to recognize
 this day by becoming aware of the rich cultural traditions of Arab-Americans
 and by participating in appropriate ceremonies and activities.
