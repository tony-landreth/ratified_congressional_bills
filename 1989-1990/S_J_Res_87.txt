One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To commend the Governments of Israel and Egypt on the occasion of the tenth
anniversary of the Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt.
Whereas in Washington, District of Columbia, on March 26, 1979, the Governments
of Israel and Egypt, with the support and encouragement of the United States,
signed a treaty of peace formally ending their state of war;
Whereas this treaty, the only peace agreement between Israel and an Arab
nation, remains a crucial element in fostering peace in the Middle East;
Whereas under terms of this historic document Israel and Egypt agreed to end
the state of war between them, Israel fully withdrew its military forces
and civilian settlements from the Sinai Peninsula, and Israel and Egypt
established formal diplomatic relations, including the exchange of ambassadors;
Whereas the establishment of peace between Israel and Egypt demonstrates
that direct bilateral negotiations are the most effective way to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict and can lead to lasting and mutually beneficial results;
Whereas the other parties to the conflict have been unwilling to enter
into direct bilateral negotiations but continue to maintain a state of war
against Israel;
Whereas the continuation of the conflict has exacted a high cost in human
lives and human suffering from both Israelis and Arabs; and
Whereas the treaty has allowed the peoples of Israel and Egypt to begin
to build a network of cultural, economic, personal, and political contacts
among themselves: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the United States Government--
 (1) commends Israel and Egypt for their historic act of courage and
 statesmanship in signing the Treaty of Peace of March 26, 1979;
 (2) calls upon the President to mark this historic anniversary with
 appropriate public activities;
 (3) welcomes the willingness of Israel and Egypt to continue to observe the
 international obligations they have accepted which have contributed to the
 peace and stability of the region; and
 (4) calls upon other Arab nations and the Palestinians to follow the example
 of Israel and Egypt, to join actively in the peace process, to renounce
 the state of war and acts of violence, and to enter into face-to-face
 negotiations to achieve a just and lasting peace.
