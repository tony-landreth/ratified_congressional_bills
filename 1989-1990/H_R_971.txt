H.R.971
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
An Act
To require the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe rules to
protect consumers from unfair practices in the provision of operator services,
and for other purposes.
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 This Act may be cited as the `Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement
 Act of 1990'.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
 The Congress finds that--
 (1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors
 in the telephone marketplace produced a variety of new services and many
 new providers of existing telephone services;
 (2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it
 essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for
 consumers and service providers alike;
 (3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts
 to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other
 aggregators of telephone business from consumers;
 (4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator
 services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only
 when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service
 providers;
 (5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of
 operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred
 long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card,
 or prearranged access code number are blocked;
 (6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect
 consumers using intrastate operator services;
 (7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications
 Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator
 services;
 (8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the
 interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the
 identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and
 the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to
 complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that
 they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the
 operation of a competitive market;
 (9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient
 to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and
 (10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation
 is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in
 a fair and reasonable manner.
SEC. 3. AMENDMENT.
 Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by inserting immediately
 after section 225 (47 U.S.C. 225) the following new section:
`SEC. 226. TELEPHONE OPERATOR SERVICES.
 `(a) DEFINITIONS- As used in this section--
 `(1) The term `access code' means a sequence of numbers that, when dialed,
 connect the caller to the provider of operator services associated with
 that sequence.
 `(2) The term `aggregator' means any person that, in the ordinary course of
 its operations, makes telephones available to the public or to transient
 users of its premises, for interstate telephone calls using a provider of
 operator services.
 `(3) The term `call splashing' means the transfer of a telephone call from one
 provider of operator services to another such provider in such a manner that
 the subsequent provider is unable or unwilling to determine the location of
 the origination of the call and, because of such inability or unwillingness,
 is prevented from billing the call on the basis of such location.
 `(4) The term `consumer' means a person initiating any interstate telephone
 call using operator services.
 `(5) The term `equal access' has the meaning given that term in Appendix
 B of the Modification of Final Judgment entered August 24, 1982, in United
 States v. Western Electric, Civil Action No. 82-0192 (United States District
 Court, District of Columbia), as amended by the Court in its orders issued
 prior to the enactment of this section.
 `(6) The term `equal access code' means an access code that allows the public
 to obtain an equal access connection to the carrier associated with that code.
 `(7) The term `operator services' means any interstate telecommunications
 service initiated from an aggregator location that includes, as a component,
 any automatic or live assistance to a consumer to arrange for billing
 or completion, or both, of an interstate telephone call through a method
 other than--
 `(A) automatic completion with billing to the telephone from which the call
 originated; or
 `(B) completion through an access code used by the consumer, with billing
 to an account previously established with the carrier by the consumer.
 `(8) The term `presubscribed provider of operator services' means the
 interstate provider of operator services to which the consumer is connected
 when the consumer places a call using a provider of operator services
 without dialing an access code.
 `(9) The term `provider of operator services' means any common carrier that
 provides operator services or any other person determined by the Commission
 to be providing operator services.
 `(b) REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVIDERS OF OPERATOR SERVICES-
 `(1) IN GENERAL- Beginning not later than 30 days after the date of enactment

 with the requirements of subsection (c) and, if applicable, subsection (e)(1);
 `(E) withhold payment (on a location-by-location basis) of any compensation,
 including commissions, to aggregators if such provider reasonably believes
 that the aggregator (i) is blocking access by means of `950' or `800'
 numbers to interstate common carriers in violation of subsection (c)(1)(B)
 or (ii) is blocking access to equal access codes in violation of rules the
 Commission may prescribe under subsection (e)(1);
 `(F) not bill for unanswered telephone calls in areas where equal access
 is available;
 `(G) not knowingly bill for unanswered telephone calls where equal access
 is not available;
 `(H) not engage in call splashing, unless the consumer requests to be
 transferred to another provider of operator services, the consumer is
 informed prior to incurring any charges that the rates for the call may
 not reflect the rates from the actual originating location of the call,
 and the consumer then consents to be transferred;
 `(I) except as provided in subparagraph (H), not bill for a call that does
 not reflect the location of the origination of the call; and
 `(J) not bill an interexchange telephone call to a billing card number which--
 `(i) is issued by another provider of operator services, and
 `(ii) permits the identification of the other provider,
unless the call is billed at a rate not greater than the other provider's rate
for the call, the consumer requests a special service that is not available
under tariff from the other provider, or the consumer expressly consents to
a rate greater than the other provider's rate.
