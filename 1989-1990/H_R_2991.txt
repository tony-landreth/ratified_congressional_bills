ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
 (1) Section 7(a)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(2)) is
 amended to read as follows:
 `(2) In agreements to participate in loans on a deferred basis under this
 subsection, such participation by the Administration, except as provided
 in paragraph (6), shall be--
 `(A) not less than 90 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding
 at the time of disbursement if such financing does not exceed $155,000:
 Provided, That the percentage of participation by the Administration may
 be reduced below 90 percent upon request of the participating lender; and
 `(B) subject to the limitation in paragraph (3)--
 `(i) not less than 70 percent nor more than 85 percent of the financing
 outstanding at the time of disbursement if such financing exceeds $155,000:
 Provided, That the participation by the Administration may be reduced below
 70 percent upon request of the participating lender; and
 `(ii) not less than 85 percent of the financing outstanding at the time of
 disbursement if such financing is a loan under paragraph (16).
The Administration shall not use the percent of guarantee requested as
a criterion for establishing priorities in approving guarantee requests
nor shall the Administration reduce the percent guaranteed to less than
85 percent under subparagraph (B) other than by determination made on each
application. Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the Administration's
participation under the Preferred Lenders Program or any successor thereto
shall be not less than 80 percent, except upon request of the participating
lender. As used in this subsection, the term `Preferred Lenders Program'
means a program under which a written agreement between the lender and the
Administration delegates to the lender (I) complete authority to make and
close loans with a guarantee from the Administration without obtaining the
prior specific approval of the Administration, and (II) authority to service
and liquidate such loans.'.
 (2) Section 7(a)(19) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(19))
 is amended to read as follows:
 `(19)(A) In addition to the Preferred Lenders Program authorized by the
 proviso in section 5(b)(7), the Administration is authorized to establish
 a Certified Lenders Program for lenders who establish their knowledge of
 Administration laws and regulations concerning the guaranteed loan program
 and their proficiency in program requirements. The designation of a lender
 as a certified lender shall be suspended or revoked at any time that the
 Administration determines that the lender is not adhering to its rules
 and regulations or that the loss experience of the lender is excessive
 as compared to other lenders, but such suspension or revocation shall not
 affect any outstanding guarantee.
 `(B) In order to encourage all lending institutions and other entities making
 loans authorized under this subsection to provide loans of $50,000 or less
 in guarantees to eligible small business loan applicants, during fiscal
 years 1989, 1990, and 1991, the Administration shall (i) develop and allow
 participating lenders to solely utilize a uniform and simplified loan form
 for such loans, and (ii) allow such lenders to retain one-half of the fee
 collected pursuant to section (7)(a)(18) on such loans. A participating lender
 may not retain any fee pursuant to this paragraph if the amount committed and
 outstanding to the applicant would exceed $50,000 unless the amount in excess
 of $50,000 is an amount not approved under the provisions of this paragraph.'.
 (3) The last sentence of subparagraph (A) of section 8(b)(1) of the Small
 Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(1)) is amended to read as follows: `In the
 case of cosponsored activities which include the participation of a Federal,
 State, or local public official or agency, the Administration shall take
 such actions as it deems necessary to ensure that the cooperation does
 not constitute or imply an endorsement by the Administration of or give
 undue recognition to the public official or agency, and the Administration
 shall ensure that it receives appropriate recognition in all cosponsored
 printed materials, whether the participant is a profit making concern or
 a governmental agency or public official.'.
 (4) Section 303 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended
 by striking subsection (c) and inserting in lieu thereof the following
 new subsections:
 `(c) Subject to the following conditions, the Administration is authorized
 to purchase preferred securities, and to purchase, or to guarantee the
 timely payment of all principal and interest payments as scheduled, on
 debentures issued by small business investment companies operating under
 the authority of section 301(d) of this Act. The full faith and credit of
 the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be
 required to be paid under any guarantee under this subsection.
 `(1) The Administration may purchase shares of nonvoting stock (or other
 corporate securities having similar characteristics): Provided, That--
 `(A) dividends are preferred and cumulative to the extent of 3 per centum
 of par value per annum, except as provided in paragraph (5);
 `(B) on liquidation or redemption the Administration is entitled to the
 preferred payment of the par value of such securities; and prior to any
 distribution (other than to the Administration) the Administration shall be
 paid any amounts as may be due pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph;
 `(C) the purchase price shall be at par value and, in any one sale, $50,000
 or more;
 `(D) the amount of such securities purchased and outstanding at any one
 time shall not exceed--
 `(i) from a company licensed on or before October 13, 1971, 200 per centum of
 the combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of such company, or
 `(ii) from any such company licensed after October 13, 1971, and having
 a combined paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of less than $500,000,
 100 per centum of such capital and surplus, or
 `(iii) from any such company licensed after October 13, 1971, and having a
 combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of $500,000 or more,
 200 per centum of such capital and surplus; and
 `(E) the amount of such securities purchased by the Administration in excess
 of 100 per centum of such capital and surplus from any company described
 in clause (i) or (iii) may not exceed an amount equal to the amount of its
 funds invested in or legally committed to be invested in equity securities;
 for the purposes of this subsection, the term `equity securities' means
 stock of any class (including preferred stock) or limited partnership
 interests, or shares in a syndicate, business trust, joint stock company
 or association, mutual corporation, cooperative or other joint venture for
 profit, or unsecured debt instruments which are subordinated by their terms
 to all other borrowings of the issuer.
 `(2) The Administration may purchase or guarantee debentures subordinated
 pursuant to subsection (b) of this section (other than securities purchased
 under paragraph (1) of this subsection (c)): Provided, That--
 `(A) such debentures are issued for a term of not to exceed fifteen years;
 `(B) the interest rate is determined pursuant to this section or section
 317; and
 `(C) the amount of debentures purchased or guaranteed and outstanding at
 any one time pursuant to this paragraph (2) from a company having combined
 private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of less than $500,000 shall not
 exceed 300 per centum of its combined private paid-in capital and paid-in
 surplus less the amount of preferred securities outstanding under paragraph
 (1) of this subsection, nor from a company having combined private paid-in
 capital and paid-in surplus of $500,000 or more, 400 per centum of its
 combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus less the amount of
 such preferred securities.
 `(3) Debentures purchased and outstanding pursuant to section 303(b) of
 this section may be retired simultaneously with the issuance of preferred
 securities to meet the requirements of subparagraph (2)(C) of this subsection
 (c).
 `(4) The Administration may require, as a condition of the purchase or
 guarantee of any securities in excess of 300 per centum of the combined
 private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of a company, that the company
 maintain a percentage of its total funds available for investment in small
 business concerns invested or legally committed in venture capital (as
 defined in subsection (b) of this section) determined by the Administration
 to be reasonable and appropriate.
 `(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, securities
 purchased by the Administration on or after the effective date of this Act (A)
 shall provide that dividends shall be preferred and cumulative to the extent
 of 4 per centum of par value per annum and (B) shall include a provision
 requiring the issuer to redeem such securities, including any accrued and
 unpaid dividends, in 15 years from the date of issuance: Provided, That
 the Administration may, in its discretion, guarantee debentures in such
 amounts as will permit the simultaneous redemption of such securities,
 including such amounts as it deems appropriate to include all or any part
 of accrued and unpaid dividends: Provided further, That the Administration
 shall not pay any part of the interest on such debentures except pursuant
 to its guarantee in the event of default in payment by the issuer.
 `(6) In no event shall the Administration purchase or guarantee debentures
 or securities if the amount of outstanding securities and debentures of a
 company operating under the authority of section 301(d) would exceed 400
 per centum of its combined private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus or
 $35,000,000, which ever is less.
 `(d) If the Administration guarantees debentures issued by a small business
 investment company operating under authority of section 301(d) of this Act,
 it shall make, on behalf of the company payments in such amounts as will
 reduce the effective rate of interest to be paid by the company during the
 first five years of the term of such debentures to a rate of interest 3 points
 below the market rate of interest determined pursuant to section 321. Such
 payments shall be made by the Administration to the holder of the debenture,
 its agents or assigns, or to the appropriate central registration agent,
 if any. The aggregate amount of debentures with interest rate reductions
 as provided in this subsection or as provided in section 317 which may be
 outstanding at any time from any such company shall not exceed 200 per centum
 of the private paid-in capital and paid-in surplus of such company. The
 authority to reduce interest rates as provided in this subsection shall
 be limited to amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts, and the
 total amount shall be reserved within the business loan and investment fund
 to pay an amount equal to the amount of the reduction as it becomes due.
 `(e) In determining the private capital of a small business investment
 company, Federal, State, or local government funds received from sources
 other than the Administration shall be included solely for regulatory
 purposes, and not for the purpose of obtaining financial assistance from or
 licensing by the Administration, providing such funds were invested prior
 to the effective date of this Act.
 `(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation,
 the Administration is authorized to allow the issuer of any preferred stock
 heretofore sold to the Administration to redeem or repurchase such stock upon
 the payment to the Administration of an amount less than the par value of
 such stock. The Administration, in its sole discretion, shall determine the
 repurchase price after considering factors including, but not limited to,
 the market value of the stock, the value of benefits previously provided
 and anticipated to accrue to the issuer, the amount of dividends previously
 paid, accrued, and anticipated, and the Administration's estimate of any
 anticipated redemption. The Administration may guarantee debentures as
 provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (c) and allow the issuer to use the
 proceeds to make the payments authorized herein. Any monies received by the
 Administration from the repurchase of preferred stock shall be deposited in
 the business loan and investment fund and shall be available solely to provide
 assistance to companies operating under the authority of section 301(d),
 to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts.'.
 (5) Section 321(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended
 by inserting after the word `companies' the following: `, including companies
 operating under the authority of section 301(d),'.
 (6) Section 204 of the Small Business Development Center Act of 1980 (Public
 Law 96-302), as amended, is further amended by striking `October 1, 1990'
 and by inserting in lieu thereof `October 1, 1991'.
 (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none of the funds
 appropriated or made available by this Act or otherwise appropriated or
 made available to the Small Business Administration shall be used to adopt,
 implement, or enforce any rule or regulation with respect to the Small
 Business Development Center program authorized by section 21 of the Small
 Business Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 648) nor may any of such funds be used to
 impose any restrictions, conditions or limitations on such program whether
 by standard operating procedure, audit guidelines or otherwise, unless
 such restrictions, conditions or limitations were in effect on October 1,
 1987, unless specifically approved by the Committee on Appropriations under
 reprogramming procedures except that this provision shall not apply to uniform
 common rules applicable to multiple Federal departments and agencies including
 the Small Business Administration; nor may any of such funds be used to
 restrict in any way the right of association of participants in such program.
 (8) The funds made available by this appropriations Act for Small Business
 Development Centers shall be available for grants for performance in fiscal
 year 1990 or fiscal year 1991.
 (9) The limitation of $1,813,250,000 on gross obligations for new direct
