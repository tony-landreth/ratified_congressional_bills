S.J.Res.362
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing on November 18, 1990, and ending on
November 24, 1990, as `National Adoption Week'.
Whereas Thanksgiving week has been commemorated as `National Adoption Week'
for the past 12 years;
Whereas we in Congress recognize the essential value of belonging to a secure,
loving permanent family as every child's right;
Whereas the President of the United States has actively promoted the benefits
of adoption by implementing a Federal program to encourage Federal employees
to consider adoption;
Whereas approximately thirty-six thousand children who have special
needs--school age, in sibling groups, members of minorities, or children
with physical, mental and emotional handicaps--are now in foster care or
institutions financed at public expense and are legally free for adoption;
Whereas the adoption by capable parents of these institutionalized or foster
care children into permanent, adoptive homes would ensure the opportunity
for their continued happiness and long-range well-being;
Whereas public and private barriers inhibiting the placement of these special
needs children must be reviewed and removed where possible to assure these
children's adoption;
Whereas the public and prospective parents must be informed of the availability
of adoptive children;
Whereas a variety of media, agencies, adoptive parent and advocacy groups,
civic and church groups, businesses, and industries will feature publicity
and information to heighten community awareness of the crucial needs of
waiting children; and
Whereas the recognition of Thanksgiving week as `National Adoption Week'
is in the best interest of adoptable children and the public in general:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing on November 18,
 1990, and ending on November 24, 1990, is designated as `National Adoption
 Week', and the President of the United States is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
