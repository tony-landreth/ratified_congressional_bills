Joint Resolution
To designate March 25, 1990, as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of
Celebration of Greek and American Democracy'.
Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the
supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas 1990 marks the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of democracy;
Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew heavily upon the
political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our
representative democracy;
Whereas March 25, 1990, marks the 169th anniversary of the beginning of the
revolution that freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire;
Whereas democratic ideals have forged a close bond between our two nations
and their peoples; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate our ideals with the Greek
people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles from which our two great
nations sprang: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 25, 1990, is designated
 as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and
 American Democracy', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that
 day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
