S.J.Res.60
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing on May 1, 1989, and ending on May 7,
1989, as
`National Drinking Water Week'.
Whereas water itself is God-given, and the drinking water that flows dependably
through our household taps results from the dedication of men and women who
operate the public water systems of collection, storage, treatment, testing,
and distribution that insures that drinking water is available, affordable,
and of unquestionable quality;
Whereas the advances in health effects research and water analysis and
treatment technologies, in conjunction with the Safe Drinking Water Act
Amendments of 1986 (Public Law 99-339), could create major changes in the
production and distribution of drinking water;
Whereas this substance, which the public uses with confidence in so many
productive ways, is without doubt the single most important product in the
world and a significant issue of the future;
Whereas the public expects high quality drinking water to always be there
when needed; and
Whereas the public continues to increase its demand for drinking water of
unquestionable quality: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing on May 1,
 1989, is designated as `National Drinking Water Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
 of the United States to observe such period with appropriate ceremonies,
 activities, and programs designated to enhance public awareness of drinking
 water issues and public recognition of the difference that drinking water
 makes to the health, safety, and quality of the life we enjoy.
