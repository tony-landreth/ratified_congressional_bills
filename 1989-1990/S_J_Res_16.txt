S.J.Res.16
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating November 1989 and November 1990 as `National Alzheimer's Disease
Month'.
Whereas more than two and one-half million Americans are affected by
Alzheimer's disease, which is a surprisingly common disorder that destroys
certain vital cells of the brain;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the fourth leading cause of death among
older Americans;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is responsible for 45 per centum of all nursing
home admissions, at an annual cost of more than $80,000,000,000;
Whereas in one-third of all American families one parent will succumb to
this disease;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is not a normal consequence of aging; and
Whereas an increase in the national awareness of the problem of Alzheimer's
Disease and recognition of national organizations such as the Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders Association and the American Health Assistance
Foundation may stimulate the interest and concern of the American people,
which may lead, in turn, to increased research and eventually to the discovery
of a cure for Alzheimer's disease: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 1989 and November 1990
 are designated as `National Alzheimer's Disease Month'. The President is
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe such months with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
