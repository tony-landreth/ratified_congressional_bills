 gas to which no first sale contract applies on the date of enactment of
 the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, subtitle A shall not apply
 to any first sale of such natural gas delivered on or after the first day
 after such date of enactment.
 `(2) EXPIRING OR TERMINATING CONTRACTS- In the case of natural gas to which
 a first sale contract applies on the date of enactment of the Natural Gas
 Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, but to which such contract ceases to apply
 after such date of enactment, subtitle A shall not apply to any first sale
 of such natural gas delivered after such contract ceases to apply.
 `(3) CERTAIN RENEGOTIATED CONTRACTS- In the case of natural gas to which
 a first sale contract applies on the date of enactment of the Natural Gas
 Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, where the parties have expressly agreed in
 writing after March 23, 1989, that all or part of the gas sold under such
 contract shall not be subject to any maximum lawful price under subtitle
 A after a specified date, subtitle A shall not apply to any first sale of
 the natural gas subject to such express agreement delivered on or after the
 date so specified, except that subtitle A shall not cease to apply to any
 such natural gas pursuant to this paragraph before the date of enactment
 of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989.

 Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, subtitle A shall not apply to
 any first sale of such natural gas delivered on or after May 15, 1991.
