Whereas the independence of the United States was achieved with significant
assistance from France and from individual citizens of France;
Whereas the ideals of liberty and freedom which animated the people of the
United States during the American Revolution were shared by many of the
people of France and are held sacred by both peoples today;
Whereas the year 1789 was of particular significance in the history of both
France and the United States, marking the opening chapter of the French
Revolution and the concluding chapter of the American Revolution;
Whereas on July 14, 1789, the people of France liberated the hated Bastille
prison, thus signifying the triumph of liberty over tyranny;
Whereas within a period of 31 days, the National Assembly of France approved
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen on August 26, 1789, and
the Congress of the United States approved the Bill of Rights on September
25, 1789, thereby proclaiming the sanctity of human rights on both sides of
the Atlantic Ocean and guaranteeing them for future generations; and
Whereas France and the United States remain fully committed to the principles
of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and the Bill of
Rights: Now, therefore, be it

 America in Congress assembled, That July 14, 1989, is designated as `National
