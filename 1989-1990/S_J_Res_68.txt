AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To designate the month of May 1989, as `Trauma Awareness Month'.
Whereas more than eight million individuals in the United States suffer
traumatic injury each year;
Whereas traumatic injury is the leading cause of death of individuals of
less than forty years of age in the United States;
Whereas every individual is a potential victim of traumatic injury;
Whereas traumatic injury can occur without warning;
Whereas traumatic injury frequently renders its victims incapable of caring
for themselves;
Whereas past inattention to the causes and effects of trauma has led to the
inclusion of trauma among the most neglected medical conditions;
Whereas the people of the United States spend more than $110,000,000,000
annually on the problem of trauma;
Whereas the problem of trauma can be remedied only by prevention and proper
treatment through emergency medical services and trauma systems; and
Whereas the people of the United States must be educated in the prevention
and treatment of trauma and in the proper and effective use of emergency
medical services and trauma systems: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That May 1989 is designated as `National
 Trauma Awareness Month', and the President of the United States is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
