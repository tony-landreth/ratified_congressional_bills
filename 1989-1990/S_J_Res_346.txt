Whereas the drug problem appears to be insurmountable, but the United States
has begun to lay the foundation to combat it;

Whereas illicit use of stimulants and sedatives continues to decline among
high school seniors, college students, and young adults in general;
Whereas public opinion polls demonstrate that the American people consider
drug abuse one of the most serious domestic problems facing the United States
and have begun to take steps to fight it;
Whereas the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth has declared
October 20 through 28, 1990, as `National Red Ribbon Week for a Drug-Free
America', has organized the National Red Ribbon Campaign to coordinate the
week, has established the theme `Line Up to Sign Up for a Drug-free Decade'
for the week, and has called for a comprehensive public awareness, prevention,

Whereas the National Red Ribbon Campaign is headed by President and
Mrs. George Bush as national honorary chairpersons, and by a distinguished

Whereas any use of an illegal drug is unacceptable, and the illegal use of
a legal drug cannot be tolerated; and
Whereas alcohol and other drug abuse destroys lives, spawns rampant crime,
undermines our economy, and threatens our national security: Now, therefore,
be it
