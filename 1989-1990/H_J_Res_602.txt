Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating October 1990 as `National Domestic Violence Awareness Month'.
Whereas it is estimated that a woman is battered every 15 seconds in the
United States;
Whereas domestic violence is the single largest cause of injury to women in
the United States, affecting 6,000,000 women;
Whereas urban and rural women of all racial, social, religious, ethnic,
and economic groups, and of all ages, physical abilities, and lifestyles
are affected by domestic violence;
Whereas 31 percent of female homicide victims in 1988 were killed by their
husbands or boyfriends;
Whereas one-third of the domestic violence incidents involve felonies,
specifically, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault;
Whereas in 50 percent of families where the wife is being abused, the children
of that family are also abused;
Whereas some individuals in law enforcement and the judicial system continue
to think of spousal abuse as a `private' matter and are hesitant to intervene
and treat domestic assault as a crime;
Whereas in 1987, over 375,000 women, plus their children, were provided
emergency shelter in domestic violence shelters and safe homes, and the
number of women and children that were sheltered by domestic violence programs
increased by 164,000 between 1983 and 1987;
Whereas 40 percent of women in need of shelter may be turned away due to a
lack of shelter space;
Whereas the nationwide efforts to help the victims of domestic violence need
to be expanded and coordinated;
Whereas there is a need to increase the public awareness and understanding
of domestic violence and the needs of battered women and their children; and
Whereas the dedication and successes of those working to end domestic violence
and the strength of the survivors of domestic violence should be recognized:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1990 is designated as `National
 Domestic Violence Awareness Month', and the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States
 to observe the month by becoming more aware of the tragedy of domestic
 violence, supporting those who are working to end domestic violence, and
 participating in other appropriate efforts.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
