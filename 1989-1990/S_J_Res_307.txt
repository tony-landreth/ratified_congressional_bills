Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating November 11 through November 17, 1990, as `National Women Veter-
ans Recognition Week'.
Whereas there are more than 1,200,000 women veterans in the Nation,
representing 4.2 percent of the total veteran population;
Whereas the number of women serving in the Armed Forces and the number of
women veterans continue to increase;
Whereas women veterans have contributed greatly to the security of the Nation
through honorable military service, which often involved great hardship
and danger;
Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of women veterans on behalf of the
Nation deserve greater public recognition and appreciation;
Whereas the special needs of women veterans, especially in the areas of
health care, have often been overlooked or inadequately addressed by the
Federal Government;
Whereas the lack of attention to the special needs of women veterans has
discouraged or prevented many women veterans from taking full advantage of
the benefits and services to which they are entitled;
Whereas women are performing a wider range of tasks in the Armed Forces
of the Nation, as demonstrated recently by the activities of women in the
military action in Panama; and
Whereas designating a week to recognize women veterans in November 1990 will
help to promote important gains made by women veterans: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That November 11 through November 17,
 1990, is designated as `National Women Veterans Recognition Week', and
 the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
