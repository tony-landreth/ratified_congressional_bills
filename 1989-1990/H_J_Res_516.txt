One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning June 10, 1990, as `National Scleroderma
Awareness
Week'.
Whereas scleroderma is a disease in which connective tissue in the body
becomes hardened and rigid, and might afflict any part of the body;
Whereas approximately three hundred thousand people in the United States
suffer from scleroderma;
Whereas women are afflicted by scleroderma three times more often than men;
Whereas scleroderma is a chronic and often progressive illness that can
result in death;
Whereas the symptoms of scleroderma vary greatly from person to person and
can complicate and confuse diagnosis;
Whereas the cause and cure of scleroderma are unknown; and
Whereas scleroderma is an orphan disease and is considered to be understudied:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning June 10, 1990,
 is designated as `National Scleroderma Awareness Week', and the President
 of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe the week with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
