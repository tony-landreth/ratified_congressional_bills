One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing November 12, 1989, and ending November 18,
1989, as `Geography Awareness Week'.
Whereas geography is the study of people, their environments, and their
resources;
Whereas the United States of America is a truly unique nation with diverse
landscapes, bountiful resources, a distinctive multiethnic population, and a
rich cultural heritage, all of which contribute to the status of the United
States as a world power;
Whereas, historically, geography has aided Americans in understanding
the wholeness of their vast nation and the great abundance of its natural
resources;
Whereas geography today offers perspectives and information in understanding
ourselves, our relationship to the Earth, and our interdependence with other
peoples of the world;
Whereas statistics illustrate that a significant number of American students
could not find the United States on a world map, could not identify Alaska
and Texas as the Nation's largest States, and could not name the New England
States;
Whereas, according to a recent Gallup poll, Americans ranked among the bottom
third on an international test of geography knowledge, and those age eighteen
to twenty-four came in last;
Whereas geography has been offered to fewer than one in ten United States
secondary school students as part of the curriculum;
Whereas departments of geography are being eliminated from American institutes
of higher learning, thus endangering the discipline of geography in the
United States;
Whereas traditional geography has virtually disappeared from the curricula
of American schools while still being taught as a basic subject in other
countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union;
Whereas an ignorance of geography, foreign languages, and cultures places the
United States at a disadvantage with other countries in matters of business,
politics, and the environment;
Whereas the United States is a nation of worldwide involvements and global
influence, the responsibilities of which demand an understanding of the lands,
languages, and cultures of the world;
Whereas, one-third of adult Americans cannot name four of the sixteen NATO
member nations, and another one-third cannot name any; and
Whereas national attention must be focused on the integral role that knowledge
of world geography plays in preparing citizens of the United States for
the future of an increasingly interdependent and interconnected world: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing November 12, 1989,
 and ending November 18, 1989, is designated as `Geography Awareness Week',
 and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
