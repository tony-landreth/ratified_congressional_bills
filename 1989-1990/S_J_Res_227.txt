Joint Resolution
To designate March 11 through March 17, 1990, as `Deaf Awareness Week'.
Whereas during the second week of March 1988, a revolutionary sequence of
historic social events evolved on the campus of Gallaudet University, the
only university in the Nation which teaches exclusively deaf and hard of
hearing students;
Whereas the events which occurred at Gallaudet University in the Spring of
1988 had great significance to all Americans, especially those who are deaf
or hard of hearing;
Whereas the week long social protest at Gallaudet University awakened the
people of nations around the world to the fact that deaf and hard of hearing
individuals are able to achieve at the same level as others and need to be
recognized as individuals with unique abilities and qualities; and
Whereas the week long social protest at Gallaudet University served to
educate and sensitize the American people concerning the hopes and dreams
of the twenty-four million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That March 11 through March 17, 1990,
 is designated as `Deaf Awareness Week'. The President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe this week by remembering the significance of the historic
 social movement, which began in March 1988 at Gallaudet University, through
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
