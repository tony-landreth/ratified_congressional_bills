 SEC. 301. The expenditure of any appropriation under this Act for any

 shall be limited to those contracts where such expenditures are a matter of
 public record and available for public inspection, except where otherwise
 provided under existing law, or under existing Executive order issued
 pursuant to existing law.
 SEC. 302. No part of any appropriation under this Act shall be available to
 the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture for use for any sale hereafter
 made of unprocessed timber from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian
 in the contiguous 48 States which will be exported from the United States,
 or which will be used as a substitute for timber from private lands which is
 exported by the purchaser: Provided, That this limitation shall not apply to
 specific quantities of grades and species of timber which said Secretaries
 determine are surplus to domestic lumber and plywood manufacturing needs.
 SEC. 303. No part of any appropriation under this Act shall be available to
 the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture for the leasing
 of oil and natural gas by noncompetitive bidding on publicly owned lands
 within the boundaries of the Shawnee National Forest, Illinois: Provided,
 That nothing herein is intended to inhibit or otherwise affect the sale,
 lease, or right to access to minerals owned by private individuals.
 SEC. 304. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall
 be available for any activity or the publication or distribution of
 literature that in any way tends to promote public support or opposition
 to any legislative proposal on which congressional action is not complete:
 Provided, That--
 (a) None of the funds authorized to be appropriated for the National
 Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities may be
 used to promote, disseminate, or produce materials which in the judgment
 of the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for
 the Humanities may be considered obscene, including but not limited to,
 depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of
 children, or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a
 whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
 (b) It is the sense of the Congress:
 (1) That under the present procedures employed for awarding National Endowment
 for the Arts grants, although the National Endowment for the Arts has had
 an excellent record over the years, it is possible for projects to be funded
 without adequate review of the artistic content or value of the work.
 (2) That recently works have been funded which are without artistic value
 but which are criticized as pornographic and shocking by any standards.
 (3) That censorship inhibits and stultifies the full expression of art.
 (4) That free inquiry and expression is reaffirmed. Therefore, be it resolved:
 (A) That all artistic works do not have artistic or humanistic excellence
 and an application can include works that possess both nonexcellent and
 excellent portions.
 (B) That the Chairman of the National Endowment for the arts has the
 responsibility to determine whether such an application should be funded.
 (C) That the National Endowment for the Arts must find a better method to seek
 out those works that have artistic excellence and to exclude those works which
 are without any redeeming literary, scholarly, cultural, or artistic value.
 (D) That a commission be established to review the National Endowment for
 the Arts grant making procedures, including those of its panel system,
 to determine whether there should be standards for grant making other than
 `substantial artistic and cultural significance, giving emphasis to American
 creativity and cultural diversity and the maintenance and encouragement of
 professional excellence' (20 U.S.C. 954(c)(1)) and if so, then what other
 standards. The criteria to be considered by the commission shall include
 but not be limited to possible standards where (a) applying contemporary
 community standards would find that the work taken as a whole appeals
 to a prurient interest; (b) the work depicts or describes in a patently
 offensive way, sexual conduct; and (c) the work, taken as a whole, lacks
 serious artistic and cultural value.
 (c)(1) There is hereby established a temporary Independent Commission for
 the purpose of--
 (A) reviewing the National Endowment for the Arts grant making procedures,
 including those of its panel system; and
 (B) considering whether the standard for publicly funded art should be
 different than the standard for privately funded art.
 (2) The Commission shall be composed of twelve members as follows:
 (A) four members appointed by the President;
 (B) four members appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the
 Speaker of the House of Representatives in consultation with the minority
 leader of the House of Representatives;
 (C) four members appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the
 President pro tempore of the Senate in consultation with the minority leader
 of the Senate;
 (D) the chairman shall be designated by vote of the Commission members; and
 (E) a quorum for the purposes of conducting meetings shall be seven.
 (3) Members of the Commission shall serve without pay. While away from their
 homes or regular places of business in the performance of services for the
 Commission, members of the Commission shall be allowed travel expenses,
 including per diem in lieu of subsistence, in the same manner as persons
 employed intermittently in Government service are allowed expenses under
 5 U.S.C. 5703.
 (4) The Commission may, for the purpose of carrying out its duties, hold
 such hearings, sit and act at such times and places, take such testimony,
 and receive such evidence, as the Commission considers appropriate.
 (5) The Commission shall issue a report to the Speaker of the House of
 Representatives and the President of the Senate no later than 180 days
 after the date of enactment of this Act.
 (6) The Commission shall expire on September 30, 1990.
 (7) Expenses of the Commission not to exceed $250,000, including
 administrative support, shall be furnished by the National Endowment for
 the Arts.
 SEC. 305. No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall remain

 SEC. 318. (a) From funds appropriated under this Act or otherwise made
 available--
 (1) The Forest Service shall offer, notwithstanding the provisions
 of the Federal Timber Contract Payment Modification Act of 1984 (16
 U.S.C. 618(a)(5)(C)), an aggregate timber sale level of seven billion seven
 hundred million board feet of net merchantable timber from the national
 forests of Oregon and Washington for fiscal years 1989 and 1990. Such timber
 sales shall be consistent with existing land and resource management plans
 or land and resource management plans as approved except, in the case of
 the Mapleton Ranger District of the Siuslaw National Forest, Oregon, such
 sales shall be consistent with the preferred alternative of the draft land
 and resource management plan and accompanying draft environmental impact
 statement dated Octrober 1, 1986, pending approval of a final land and
 resource management plan for the Siuslaw National Forest: Provided, That
 of the seven billion seven hundred million board foot aggregate timber sale
 level for fiscal years 1989 and 1990, timber sales offered from the thirteen
 national forests in Oregon and Washington known to contain northern spotted
 owls shall meet an aggregate timber sale level for fiscal years 1989 and
 1990 of five billion eight hundred million board feet of net merchantable
 timber: Provided further, That the sales volume shall be distributed in
 the same proportion between Oregon and Washington national forests known to
 contain northern spotted owls based on the average sale volume for fiscal
 years 1986 through 1988.
 (2) The Bureau of Land Management shall offer such volumes as are required
 in fiscal year 1990 to meet an aggregate timber sale level of one billion
 nine hundred million board feet for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 from its
 administrative districts in western Oregon.
 (b)(1) In accordance with subsection (b)(2) of this section, all timber
 sales from the thirteen national forests in Oregon and Washington known to
 contain northern spotted owls prepared or offered pursuant to this section
 shall minimize fragmentation of the most ecologically significant old growth
 forest stands. `Old growth forest stands' are defined as those stands
 meeting the criteria according to Forest Service Research Publication
 Numbered PNW-447. In those instances where the Forest Service, after
 consultation with the advisory boards established pursuant to subsection
 (c) of this section, determines that the definition in Forest Service
 Research Publication Numbered PNW-447 is not fully applicable in national
 forests known to contain northern spotted owls, the Forest Service shall
 use old-growth definitions contained in its Pacific Northwest Regional Guide.
 (2) To the extent that fragmentation of ecologically significant old growth
 forest stands is necessary to meet the timber sale levels directed by
 subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Forest Service shall minimize such
 fragmentation in the ecologically significant old growth forest stands on
 a national forest-by-national forest basis based on the Forest Service's
 discretion in determining the ecologically significant stands after
 considering input from the advisory boards created pursuant to subsection
 (c) of this section. The habitat of nesting pairs of spotted owls which
 are not in the Spotted Owl Habitat Areas (SOHAs) described in subsection
 (b)(3) of this section shall be considered an important factor in the
 identification of ecologically significant old growth forest stands.
 (3) No timber sales offered pursuant to this section from the thirteen
 national forests in Oregon and Washington known to contain northern spotted
 owls may occur within SOHAs identified pursuant to the Final Supplement to
 the Environmental Impact Statement for an Amendment to the Pacific Northwest
 Regional Guide--Spotted Owl and the accompanying Record of Decision issued
 by the Forest Service on December 8, 1988 as adjusted by this subsection:
 (A) For the Olympic Peninsula Province, which includes the Olympic National
 Forest, SOHA size is to be 3,200 acres;
 (B) For the Washington Cascades Province, which includes the
 Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie, Okanogan, Wenatchee, and Gifford-Pinchot National
 Forests, SOHA size is to be 2,600 acres;
 (C) For the Oregon Cascades Province, which includes the Mt. Hood, Willamette,
 Rogue River, Deschutes, Winema, and Umpqua National Forests, SOHA size is
 to be 1,875 acres;
 (D) For the Oregon Coast Range Province, which includes the Siuslaw National
 Forest, SOHA size is to be 2,500 acres; and
 (E) For the Klamath Mountain Province, which includes the Siskiyou National
 Forest, SOHA size is to be 1,250 acres.
 (F) All other standards and guidelines contained in the Chief's Record of
 Decision are adopted.
 (4) In planning for the preparation and offer of timber sales authorized in
 subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Forest Service, to the extent possible
 in areas proximate to SOHA sites identified in subsection (b)(3) of this
 section, should exercise discretion in selecting sites and/or silvicultural
 prescriptions in order to retain spotted owl habitat characteristics in such
 areas. The Forest Service should consider the relative location and quality
 of such areas contiguous to the SOHAs and should give higher priority to
 preparing and offering sales in areas of lower quality and less important
 location than to areas of greater quality and more important location
 relative to the SOHAs.
 (5) No timber sales offered pursuant to this section on Bureau of Land
 Management lands in western Oregon known to contain northern spotted
 owls shall occur within the 110 areas identified in the December 22, 1987
 agreement, except sales identified in said agreement, between the Bureau of
 Land Management and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Not later
 than thirty days after enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Land Management,
 after consulting with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the
 United States Fish and Wildlife Service to identify high priority spotted
 owl area sites, shall select an additional twelve spotted owl habitat
 areas. No timber sales may be offered in the areas identified pursuant to
 this subsection during fiscal year 1990.
 (6)(A) Without passing on the legal and factual adequacy of the Final
 Supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement for an Amendment to the
 Pacific Northwest Regional Guide--Spotted Owl Guidelines and the accompanying
 Record of Decision issued by the Forest Service on December 8, 1988 or the
 December 22, 1987 agreement between the Bureau of Land Management and the
 Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife for management of the spotted owl, the
 Congress hereby determines and directs that management of areas according to
 subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section on the thirteen national forests
 in Oregon and Washington and Bureau of Land Management lands in western
 Oregon known to contain northern spotted owls is adequate consideration for
 the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the basis for
 the consolidated cases captioned Seattle Audubon Society et al., v. F. Dale
 Robertson, Civil No. 89-160 and Washington Contract Loggers Assoc. et al.,
 v. F. Dale Robertson, Civil No. 89-99 (order granting preliminary injunction)
 and the case Portland Audubon Society et al., v. Manuel Lujan, Jr., Civil
 No. 87-1160-FR. The guidelines adopted by subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5)
 of this section shall not be subject to judicial review by any court of
 the United States.
 (B) The Forest Service is directed to review and revise as appropriate
 the decision adopted in the December 1988 Record of Decision referenced in
 subsection (b)(6)(A) of this section and shall consider any new information
 gathered subsequent to the issuance of the Record of Decision, including
 the interagency guidelines for conservation of northern spotted owls
 developed by the Interagency Scientific Committee to address conservation
 of the northern spotted owl. This review, and any resulting changes to the
 December 1988 decision determined to be necessary by the Forest Service
 are to be completed and in effect not later than September 30, 1990.
 (c)(1) The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior shall name advisory
 boards on a national forest-by-national forest and Bureau of Land Management
 district-by-district basis which shall be comprised of not more than
 seven individuals who, in the appropriate Secretary's judgment, represent
 a diversity of views. In the process of selecting individuals to serve on
 the advisory boards, the Secretaries shall make every effort to recognize
 the diversity of views and perspectives and allow parties which represent
 a cross-section of those views to participate in making recommendations
 in the selection of board members, provided, that every effort will be
 made to ensure the advisory boards are comprised of an equal number of
 representatives of environmental and business concerns. The advisory boards
 shall be named not later than thirty days after enactment of this Act. The
 advisory boards shall provide recommendations to the Forest Service and the
 Bureau of Land Management in reviewing prospective timber sales which shall
 meet the timber sale levels directed by this section prior to their offer. The
 advisory boards shall present their advice within fifteen or forty-five days
 after receipt of the necessary review documents. The fifteen-day period
 applies to single sales and the forty-five-day period applies to multiple
 sales. The members of the advisory boards authorized by this section shall
 serve without compensation or reimbursement of expenses. The Forest Service
 and the Bureau of Land Management are authorized to use available funds
 for the services of professional, independent facilitators to assist in
 the work of the advisory boards.
 (2) The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management shall consider the
 recommendations of the advisory boards once such boards are established
 pursuant to this section, including any suggested modifications of individual
 sales. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management shall also consider
 recommendations made by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on those
 timber sales conferred upon under section 7(a)(4) or, if the spotted owl is
 listed as a threatened or endangered species, consult under section 7(a)(2)
 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)
 and (a)(4)) prior to the offer of any subsequent timber sale in fiscal year
 1990. These recommendations shall be considered regardless of whether the
 agreement provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section has been reached,
 entered into, and accepted by the relevant court. Adoption or rejection of
 such recommended modifications shall not require preparation of additional
 environmental documents, notwithstanding any other provision of law.
 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, there shall be not more than
 one level of administrative appeal of any decision by the Forest Service or
 the Bureau of Land Management to undertake any activity directed by this
 section for timber sales to be prepared, advertised, offered, and awarded
 during fiscal year 1990 from the thirteen national forests in Oregon and
 Washington and Bureau of Land Management lands in western Oregon known to
 contain northern spotted owls. If an administrative stay is granted in any
 such appeal the Regional Forester or the Interior Board of Land Appeals
 shall issue a final decision on the merits within forty-five days of the
 date of issuance of such stay. Notwithstanding any other provision of law,
 any party seeking to challenge a decision made after the date of enactment
 of this Act to prepare, advertise, offer, or award a timber sale in fiscal
 year 1990 from the thirteen national forests and Bureau of Land Management
 lands in western Oregon known to contain northern spotted owls need not
 exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit. Nothing in this
 subsection shall alter the administrative appeal requirements of the Forest
 Service or Bureau of Land Management.
 (e) Nothing in this section shall affect interagency cooperation among the
 Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the United States Fish
 and Wildlife Service under sections 7(a)(2) and 7(a)(4) of the Endangered
 Species Act and its regulations.
 (f)(1) Not later than two days after enactment of this Act, the Forest
 Service shall submit to plaintiffs in the captioned case Seattle Audubon
 Society et al., v. F. Dale Robertson, Civil No. 89-160, a list of sales
 which had been prepared for offer in fiscal year 1989 and which contain
 at least 40 acres of suitable spotted owl habitat. Not later than fourteen
 days after receipt of such list, plaintiffs to the suit referenced in this
 subsection may enter into an agreement with the Forest Service releasing
 for sale not less than one billion one hundred million board feet of net
 merchantable timber. Such sales must be available for advertisment not
 later than fourteen days after the agreement required by this subsection
 is reached. Such timber sales selected shall not be subject to further
 judicial review by any court of the United States.
 (2) If the agreement specified in subsection (f)(1) of this section
 is reached, then those timber sales described in the list submitted to
 plaintiffs pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of this section but not contained
 in the agreement authorized by subsection (f)(1) of this section shall not
 be offered for sale in fiscal year 1990.
 (3) If the agreement authorized under subsection (f)(1) of this section is
 not implemented within the timeframes prescribed in subsection (f)(1) of
 this section, one billion one hundred million board feet of net merchantable
 timber from such sales submitted to plaintiffs pursuant to subsection (f)(1)
 of this section shall be selected and modified as appropriate by the Forest
 Service in accordance with the provisions of this section. Selected sales
 shall be prepared, advertised, offered, awarded and operated notwithstanding
 any provision of law that is a basis for any stay, injunction or order
 issued in the proceeding identified in subsection (f)(1) of this section:
 Provided, That nothing in this subsection shall affect rights available
 under the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
 (4) The Forest Service shall, for each respective timber sale, lift its own
 stay or apply to the appropriate court for the lifting of the restraining
 order or injunction whose basis has been withdrawn by this section.
 (5) Timber sales selection pursuant to subsections (f)(1) or (f)(3) of
 this section shall be based on the following criteria: (1) proportional
 distribution between Oregon and Washington national forests known to contain
 northern spotted owls based on the average sale volumes for fiscal years
 1986 through 1988; (2) proportional distribution to the extent possible
 among the thirteen national forests known to contain northern spotted
 owls in Oregon and Washington based on the average sale volumes for fiscal
 years 1986 through 1988; and (3) to the extent possible, selection of sales
 outside the habitat of nesting pairs of spotted owls which are not in the
 Spotted Owl Habitat Areas described in subsection (b)(3) of this section.
 (g)(1) No restraining order or preliminary injunction shall be issued by
 any court of the United States with respect to any decision to prepare,
 advertise, offer, award, or operate a timber sale or timber sales in fiscal
 year 1990 from the thirteen national forests in Oregon and Washington and
 Bureau of Land Management lands in western Oregon known to contain northern
 spotted owls. The provisions of section 705 of title 5, United States Code,
 shall not apply to any challenge to such a timber sale: Provided, That the
 courts shall have authority to enjoin permanently, order modification of,
 or void an individual sale if it has been determined by a trial on the
 merits that the decision to prepare, advertise, offer, award, or operate
 such sale was arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law:
 Provided further, That any challenge to a timber sale must be filed in Federal
 District Court within fifteen days of the date of initial advertisement of
 the challenged timber sale: Provided further, That for forty-five days after
 the date of filing of a challenge to a timber sale the affected agency shall
 take no action to award a challenged timber sale. Civil actions filed under
 this section shall be assigned for hearing at the earliest possible date
 and shall take precedence over all other matters pending on the docket
 of the court at that time except for criminal cases: Provided further,
 That the court shall render its final decision relative to any challenge
 within forty-five days from the date such challenge is brought, unless the
 court determines that a longer period of time is required to satisfy the
 requirements of the United States Constitution.
 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court may set rules
 governing the procedures of any such proceeding which set page limits
 on briefs and time limits on filing briefs and motions and other actions
 which are shorter than the limits specified in the Federal rules of civil
 or appellate procedure.
 (3) In order to reach a decision within forty-five days, the Federal
 District Court may assign all or part of any such case or cases to one or
 more Special Masters, for prompt review and recommendations to the court.
 (h) The Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the United States
 Fish and Wildlife Service shall submit reports updating their findings and
 progress as determined by the process recognized under subsection (e) of this
 section on a monthly basis to the President of the Senate and the Speaker
 of the House of Representatives for appropriate referral. Such reports
 shall also include information on the extent to which recommendations of
 the advisory boards established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section
 were integrated into timber sale decisions as well as reasons for modifying
 or not adopting recommendations made by the advisory boards. Such reports
 shall be submitted as directed beginning on December 1, 1989, and ending
 on September 30, 1990.
 (i) Except for provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the provisions
 of this section apply solely to the thirteen national forests in Oregon and
 Washington and Bureau of Land Management districts in western Oregon known
 to contain northern spotted owls. Nothing contained in this section shall
 be construed to require the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management
 to develop similar policies on any other forest or district in Oregon
 or Washington.
 (j) The advisory boards established under this section shall not be subject
 to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (86 Stat. 770).
 (k) Timber sales offered to meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this
 section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this section for
 the duration of those sale contracts. All other provisions of this section
 shall remain in effect until September 30, 1990.
