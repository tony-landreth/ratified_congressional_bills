Joint Resolution
To designate October 17, 1990, as `National Drug-Free Schools and Communities
Education and Awareness Day'.
Whereas one in every two high school seniors who graduated in 1989 used an
illegal drug before graduating;
Whereas the Congress recognizes that drug abuse exists among people in
all geographic areas, of all socioeconomic classes, and of all ethnic and
racial groups;
Whereas the Congress recognizes that education and public awareness regarding
the dangers of drug abuse are necessary to prevent the children and young
people of this Nation from entering into cycles of drug abuse; and
Whereas the Congress recognizes that members of a community must unite and
work together to address the drug abuse problem that this Nation confronts:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That October 17, 1990, is designated as
 "National Drug-Free Schools and Communities Education and Awareness Day", and
 the President is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States, departments and agencies of State and local governments,
 and interested organizations to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies,
 activities, and programs.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
