One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of October 8, 1989, through October 14, 1989, as
`National Job
Skills Week'.
Whereas the ability to maintain an internationally competitive and productive
economy and a high standard of living depends on the development and
utilization of new technologies;
Whereas new technologies require skills that are currently lacking in the
national workforce;
Whereas experts in both the public and private sectors predict that a
shortage of skilled entry-level workers will exist through the remainder of
this century;
Whereas young people in the United States are experiencing higher than normal
unemployment rates because many of them lack the skills necessary to perform
the entry-level jobs that are currently available;
Whereas these young people will continue to experience higher than normal
unemployment rates unless they develop the skills necessary to perform the
entry-level jobs that become available;
Whereas American workers who face dislocation due to plant closures and
industrial relocation need special training and education to prepare for
new jobs and new opportunities; and
Whereas a National Job Skills Week can serve to focus attention on present
and future workforce needs, to encourage public and private cooperation in
job training and educational efforts, and to highlight the technological
changes underway in the workplace: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 8, 1989, through
 October 14, 1989, is designated as `National Job Skills Week', and the
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
