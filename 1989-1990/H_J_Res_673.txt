H.J.Res.673
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate November 2, 1990, as a national day of prayer for members of
American military forces and American citizens stationed or held hostage in
the Middle East, and for their families.
Whereas the United States has responded decisively to the crisis in the Middle
East created by the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi military forces,
the threat of Iraqi aggression against Saudi Arabia and other countries,
and the unlawful hostage-taking by Iraqi military forces;
Whereas President Bush, in order to preserve international order and protect
American interests and lives in the Middle East, has deployed American
military forces to counter Iraqi aggression;
Whereas American civilian reservists called to active duty are making great
personal sacrifices to serve in the Middle East and, like other American
military forces serving there, are at great personal risk;
Whereas those taken hostage by Iraqi military forces are in daily danger;
Whereas families of American military and civilian personnel serving in the
Middle East face terrible anxiety;
Whereas a strong majority of Americans support the deployment of American
military forces by President Bush in the Middle East, and all Americans hope
that a just outcome may be reached in the Middle East without war;
Whereas Americans are willing to accept sacrifices resulting from the use
of military force, fight armed aggression, defend national interests, and
protect the lives and welfare of American citizens; and
Whereas Americans have traditionally recognized that military strength alone
is not sufficient, and now should also trust in Providence, and remembering
that, according to the Scriptures, `unless the Lord keeps the city, the
watchman worketh but in vain':  Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) it is the sense of the Congress that the President should declare
 November 2, 1990, a national day of prayer for members of American military
 forces and American citizens stationed or held hostage in the Middle East,
 and for their families;
 (2) all Americans should pray for President Bush, his advisors, the leaders
 of American military forces in the Middle East, and the leaders of other
 countries which have deployed military forces in the Middle East to stop
 Iraqi aggression, that they retain the wisdom and courage to bring about
 a just resolution to the Middle East crisis;
 (3) all Americans should pray for Iraqi President Hussein, his advisors, and
 the leaders of the Iraqi military forces, that they remove their military
 forces from Kuwait, release all hostages unharmed from their current
 captivity, resist further acts of aggression against other countries, meet
 the conditions of applicable United Nations resolutions, and act prudently
 in the furtherance of peace; and
 (4) all Americans should observe such day in prayer and meditation at
 churches, in groups, and as individuals.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
