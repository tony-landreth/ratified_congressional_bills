 agreement and the planned follow-on negotiations for further reductions;
 (2) the two-missile mobile ICBM modernization program has failed to achieve
 the political consensus necessary for deployment of both systems;
 (3) as long as peaceful trends continue in the Soviet Union, the defense
 budget of the United States is likely to continue to decline in the
 future, making the deployment of both the RGMX system and the SICBM system
 unaffordable;
 (4) at a minimum the United States should continue to develop the SICBM system
 for deployment in silos to meet future United States ICBM modernization
 requirements and arms control objectives, while preserving a realistic
 option for subsequent mobile basing should future strategic or arms control
 developments so require; and
 (5) any funds obligated or expended for the RGMX system should be used only
 to conduct critical activities needed to complete research, development,
 test, and evaluation and maintain the key technologies for that system on
 a stand-by or `moth ball' status.
SEC. 232. DEPRESSED TRAJECTORY BALLISTIC MISSILES AND OTHER
SHORT-TIME-OF-FLIGHT BALLISTIC MISSILES

 United States and the Soviet Union observe an interim mutual restraint on
 the flight testing of depressed trajectory and other short-time-of-flight
 ballistic missiles and expresses disappointment that the Soviet Union has
 not agreed to this proposal. Congress urges the President to continue to
 pursue such interim restraint and to further explore the possibility of a

SEC. 1009. ANDEAN ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The support for democratic process and civilian governance in the Andean
 countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, the first two of which have only
 recently emerged from periods of military rule, is a necessary precondition
 for long-term stability in those countries and for the successful fight
 against the production and traffic of illegal drugs in those countries.
 (2) The separation of military and civilian law enforcement functions
 has historically been a critical element in democracies around the world,
 including the United States.
 (3) There is a need to determine whether the current policies of the United
 States unduly emphasize assistance to military entities of those countries
 rather than civilian law enforcement entities in carrying out anti-drug
 efforts in those countries and whether such policies might tend to undermine
 the dual long-term policy goals of the United States of stopping the traffic
 of drugs at their sources and the preservation of civilian control over
 the newly established democracies of the Andean countries.
 (4) There is a need to assess the impact that United States assistance
 in the Andean anti-drug effort will have on reducing drug activity and
 supporting democratic processes in the Andean countries.
 (b) REPORT REQUIRED- (1) Not later than 90 days after the date of the
 enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense
 shall, in consultation with the Director of the Office of National Drug
 Control Policy, jointly submit to Congress a report detailing current United
 States policies with respect to the Andean countries in general and with
 respect to the counter-drug enforcement activities and associated training
 programs of the United States in such countries in particular.
 (2) Such report shall include an analysis of the impact that the involvement
 of the military forces of the Andean countries in counter-drug enforcement
 activities has on the democratic institutions of those countries and how
 the civilian institutions of those countries might be strengthened in order
 to assure the successful pursuit of a counter-drug strategy.
 (3) Such report shall contain specific legislative recommendations for
 improving the assistance activities of the United States in the Andean
 countries in order to avoid unnecessary duplications and contradictions in
 meeting United States policy goals in those countries.
SEC. 1010. CREATION OF A MULTILATERAL COUNTER-DRUG STRIKE FORCE
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Congress has in the past sought approval for a multilateral strike
 force dedicated to the war on drugs.
 (2) The proposal by the Prime Minister of Jamaica for the creation of a
 multilateral, international counter-drug strike force is the first operative
 proposal for the use of a multilateral force against the drug cartels in
 Latin America by a government leader in the Western Hemisphere and should
 be given serious consideration.
 (b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) the Prime Minister of Jamaica is to be commended for his proposal;
 (2) the President should call for international negotiations for the purpose
 of discussing the establishment of an international strike force to counter
 international drug traffickers; and
 (3) the United States should work through the United Nations and other
 multilateral organizations to determine the feasibility of establishing
 and using a force and should assist in the establishment of such a force
 if the President determines the proposal to be feasible.

SEC. 1431. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON GREATER USE OF THE RESERVE COMPONENTS
OF THE ARMED FORCES
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The reserve components of the Armed Forces are an essential element of
 the national security establishment of the United States.
 (2) The overall reduction in the threat and the likelihood of continued
 fiscal constraints require the United States to increase use of the reserve
 components of the Armed Forces.
 (3) The Department of Defense has not adequately implemented the Total
 Force Policy since its inception in 1973.
 (4) The Department of Defense should shift a greater share of force structure
 and budgetary resources to the reserve components of the Armed Forces.
 (5) Expanding the reserve components is the most effective way to retain
 quality personnel as the force structure of the active components is reduced
 over the next five years.
 (6) The United States should recommit itself to the concept of the citizen
 soldier as a cornerstone of national defense policy for the future.
 (7) The President and the Secretary of Defense should take note of and be
 willing to exercise existing reserve call-up authority for the purpose of
 using reserve component forces to perform operational missions without the
 necessity for declaring a national emergency.
 (b) CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION- In view of the findings expressed in subsection
 (a), Congress declares that--
 (1) the structure and strength of the current reserve components should
 be preserved;
 (2) the equipment levels in existing reserve component units should be
 increased to match their active duty counterparts;
 (3) selected missions of the active components of the Armed Forces should
 be increasingly transferred to the reserve components;
 (4) the equipment available to the units of the reserve components should
 be modernized; and
 (5) the integration of active component and reserve component units should
 be promoted as a means of achieving the Total Force Policy of the Department
 of Defense.
SEC. 1432. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
READY RESERVE
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) as a result of the recent dramatic changes in Eastern Europe and the
 Soviet Union, the active military forces of the United States will be
 significantly reduced; and
 (2) as a consequence of that reduction it will be necessary to rely
 increasingly, in the event of a threat to the national security, on the
 immediate availability of trained personnel of the Ready Reserve of the
 reserve components of the Armed Forces.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the finding in subsection (a), it is
 the sense of Congress that--
 (1) the Secretary of Defense should take appropriate action to ensure
 that members of the Ready Reserve are made fully aware of their continuing
 obligation for immediate service in the active military forces in the event
 of a war or national emergency;
 (2) the Secretary should use the annual muster provided for under section
 687 of title 10, United States Code, as a means of alerting such personnel
 to that obligation; and
 (3) the Secretary should ensure that adequate funds are made available,
 out of funds appropriated for the reserve components, to carry out the
 annual muster of such personnel.
SEC. 1433. COMMENDATION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Since the earliest days of this Nation, citizen-soldiers of the United
 States have protected their fellow citizens, defended the country, and
 provided heroic assistance during and following natural disasters.
 (2) The citizen-soldier has played a key role in the protection of freedom
 since the days of the American Revolution.
 (3) The National Guard and the Reserve have been accorded significantly
 increased status in the overall defense posture of the United States since
 the end of World War II.
 (4) During a period in history when the Nation may face new and varied threats
 to peace, it is imperative that the combat capability of the National Guard
 and the Reserve be adequately maintained and supported.
 (5) The excellence of the National Guard and Reserve is directly attributable
 to hard work and dedication of the outstanding men and women who regularly
 perform duty in the Guard and Reserve.
 (b) CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION- In light of the findings in subsection
 (a), Congress--
 (1) acknowledges the valuable contribution that the men and women of the
 National Guard and the Reserve have made to the Nation's security; and
 (2) continues to support the essential role that the National Guard and
 the Reserve perform in the total defense establishment of the United States.
SEC. 1434. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING UNITED STATES ARMORED FORCES
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Dramatic political and military changes have occurred recently in
 Eastern Europe.
 (2) The Warsaw Pact is no longer a credible military threat to the North
 Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
 (3) It appears that the heavy armored armies of both NATO and the Warsaw
 Pact will be substantially reduced as the result of arms control agreements
 or unilateral actions.
 (4) There is a continued need for armor forces and many countries possess
 large inventories of modern tanks.
 (5) The Soviet Union will still produce 1,400 new tanks in 1990.
 (6) With significantly increased warning times of enemy attack, greater
 reliance will be placed on United States reserve component forces for
 armored heavy force reinforcement missions.
 (7) There is a need to enhance the capabilities of armored forces of the
 reserve components to assume increased responsibilities for armored heavy
 force reinforcement missions.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is
 the sense of the Congress that--
 (1) the Army should take timely and necessary steps to enhance the
 capabilities of armored forces of the reserve components;
 (2) the United States Army Armor Center should continue as the center for
 training, education, doctrine, and combat development for the armored forces
 of the United States, both active and reserve; and
 (3) the United States Army Armor Center should ensure that the armored forces
 of the reserve components are adequately prepared to accept the increased role
 in armored heavy force reinforcement missions that will be assigned to them.
SEC. 1435. PRESERVATION OF FORCE STRUCTURE IN THE RESERVE COMPONENTS
 (a) IN GENERAL- The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the force structure

Part D--Arms Control Matters
SEC. 1441. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ADDITIONAL NUCLEAR RISK REDUCTION MEASURES
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) On June 1, 1990, the President of the United States and the President
 of the Soviet Union signed a document entitled `Joint Statement on Future
 Negotiations on Nuclear and Space Arms and Further Enhancing Strategic
 Stability'.
 (2) In that document, the two nations pledged to pursue additional
 confidence-building and predictability measures `that would reduce
 the possibility of an outbreak of nuclear war as a result of accident,
 miscalculation, terrorism, or unexpected technological breakthrough, and
 would prevent possible incidents between them'.
 (3) As a result of the recent increase in ethnic, national, economic, and
 political tensions within the Soviet Union, concern has heightened regarding
 the possible unauthorized or accidental use of Soviet nuclear weapons.
 (4) It has been four years since the Department of Defense conducted
 a comprehensive review of its nuclear control procedures and failsafe
 mechanisms.
 (5) The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in its 1990 Joint Military Net Assessment,
 concluded that with the recent changes in the global security environment
 `the risk of nuclear deterrence failing is assessed to be low and at this
 moment to be decreasing'.
 (6) While Congress is concerned about continued strategic offensive and
 defensive modernization by the Soviet Union and the unpredictable status
 of the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, at this stage the lessened
 prospects that nuclear weapons of the United States might have to be
 employed may afford an opportunity to reconsider past reluctance to use
 certain positive control measures, such as the installation of permissive
 action links (PALs) on nuclear weapons deployed at sea by the United States
 and the installation of post-launch destruct mechanisms on intercontinental
 ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs)
 deployed by the United States, as long as appropriate security measures
 can be developed to protect the integrity of such destruct mechanisms.
 (7) On September 15, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed
 to establish Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRCs) in Washington and Moscow.
 (8) The NRRCs have made a useful contribution to lowering the risks of
 accidental or inadvertent nuclear war and are capable of taking on expanded
 roles.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress--
 (1) that the President of the United States and the President of the Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics are to be commended for their June 1, 1990,
 joint statement to pursue additional nuclear confidence-building measures; and
 (2) that, in keeping with that joint statement, the President--
 (A) should invite the Soviet Union to join with the United States in
 conducting separate but parallel, comprehensive reviews of each nation's
 own nuclear control procedures and failsafe mechanisms; and
 (B) should propose to the Soviet Union that representatives of the two
 nations engage in discussions with the objective of agreeing on additional
 roles and functions that could be assigned to the Nuclear Risk Reduction
 Centers to further lessen the risks of the outbreak of nuclear war as the
 result of misinterpretation, miscalculation, or accident.
 (c) REPORT ON ADDITIONAL MEASURES- Not later than March 1, 1991, the
 President shall submit to Congress a report (in both classified and
 unclassified form) assessing additional nuclear risk reduction measures
 which could be implemented pursuant to the joint statement of June 1, 1990,
 referred to in subsection (b), including the following:
 (1) Assigning to the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRCs) such expanded
 roles as the following:
  (A) Serving as a forum for discussions between the two nations on responding
  to possible nuclear terrorism.
 (B) Transmitting notifications that may be required under future arms
 control treaties.
 (C) Transmitting non-urgent notifications and information requests required
 under Article 5 of the 1971 Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Risk of
 Outbreak of Nuclear War Between the United States and the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics.
 (D) Providing a forum for discussions between the United States and the
 Soviet Union on restricting nuclear, chemical, and missile proliferation.
 (E) Serving as a meeting place for high-level military discussions on
 nuclear doctrines, forces and activities, and regional security concerns.
 (2) Installation of post-launch destruct mechanisms on all intercontinental
 ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs)
 deployed by the United States.
 (3) Installation by the United States of permissive action links (PALs)
 on all nuclear weapons at sea.
SEC. 1442. START AND STRATEGIC MODERNIZATION
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in the Strategic
 Arms Reduction Talks (START) in Geneva.
 (2) In the Joint Statement on the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms signed
 in June 1990, the two sides reaffirmed their determination to have a START
 agreement completed and ready for signature by the end of 1990.
 (3) Under the provisions of a START agreement, both sides will carry out
