the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets shall inspect such pipeline facility and
report to the Secretary on any portion of the pipeline facility which is
exposed or is a hazard to navigation. This subparagraph shall apply only
to pipeline facilities between the mean high water mark and the point where
the subsurface is under 15 feet of water, as measured from mean low water.
 `(B) EXTENSION- The Secretary may extend the time period for compliance under
 subparagraph (A) with respect to a pipeline facility for an additional period
 of up to six months if the operator of the pipeline facility demonstrates
 to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a good faith effort, with due

 subparagraph (A).
 `(C) PRIOR INSPECTION RECOGNITION- Any inspection of a pipeline facility
 which has occurred after October 3, 1989, may be used for compliance with
 subparagraph (A), if the inspection conforms to the requirements of that
 subparagraph.

 after the date of enactment of this subsection, establish standards--
 `(i) for the purposes of this subsection, for what constitutes an exposed
 pipeline facility; and

 facility described in paragraph (1)(A) who discovers any portion of the
 pipeline facility which is a hazard to navigation shall mark the location

 and shall immediately notify the Secretary as provided by the Secretary
 pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Any marine buoy or marker
 used pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered a pipeline sign or
 right-of-way marker for purposes of section 11(c)(3).

 date of enactment of this subsection, on the basis of experience with the
 initial inspection program under paragraph (1) and any other information
 available to the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish a mandatory,
 systematic, and where appropriate, periodic inspection program of offshore
 pipeline facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.
 `(4) BURIAL REQUIREMENT- The Secretary shall, by regulation, require that
 each offshore pipeline facility--
 `(A) that is subject to inspection under paragraph (1) and is exposed or
 constitutes a hazard to navigation; or
 `(B) that constitutes a hazard to navigation,
is buried within six months after the date that the condition of the pipeline
facility is reported to the Secretary. The Secretary may extend the time period
for compliance under this paragraph with respect to a pipeline facility for
such period as is reasonable to ensure compliance with this paragraph.'.

the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets, other than gathering lines of 4 inch
nominal diameter and smaller, shall inspect such pipeline facility and
report to the Secretary on any portion of the pipeline facility which is
exposed or is a hazard to navigation. This subparagraph shall apply only
to pipeline facilities between the mean high water mark and the point where
the subsurface is under 15 feet of water, as measured from mean low water.
 `(B) EXTENSION- The Secretary may extend the time period for compliance under
 subparagraph (A) with respect to a pipeline facility for an additional period
