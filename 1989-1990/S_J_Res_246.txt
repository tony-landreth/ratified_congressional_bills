AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Calling upon the United Nations to repeal General Assembly Resolution 3379.
Whereas the United Nations will celebrate the forty-fifth anniversary of
its charter on June 26, 1990;
Whereas Article I of the United Nations Charter establishes the United
Nations as `a center for harmonizing the actions of nations';
Whereas on November 10, 1990, fifteen years will have passed since the
adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 which formally
declared Zionism to be `a form of racism and racial discrimination';
Whereas Zionism is a national movement of the Jewish people for
self-determination, a legitimate and moral aspiration characteristic of many
national groups in the modern world;
Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 has had as its overt
purpose the delegitimation of the State of Israel;
Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 has impeded the
struggle against real forms of racial bigotry and has had the incendiary
effect of stimulating and encouraging anti-semitism;
Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 has been used to
justify terrorist attacks against innocent people;
Whereas United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 is violative of the
principles of the United Nations Charter and makes it impossible for the
General Assembly to play a credible role in the peaceful resolution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict; and
Whereas Public Laws 99-90 (S.J. Res. 98, 1985) and 100-169 (S.J. Res. 205,
1987) and earlier expressions of congressional concern bearing on this subject
demonstrate that the United States condemns, denounces, and repudiates United
Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) the United States calls upon all member states of the United Nations
 General Assembly to take immediate action to repeal United Nations General
 Assembly Resolution 3379;
 (2) the President shall periodically report to the Congress on progress
 made toward the repeal of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379; and
 (3) the Congress commends the President for his commitment to achieving
 this goal.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
