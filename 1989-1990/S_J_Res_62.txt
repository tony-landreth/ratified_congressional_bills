Joint Resolution
Designating May 1989 as `National Stroke Awareness Month'.
Whereas stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States;
Whereas stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States;
Whereas stroke is a distinct disease of the brain and nervous system,
causing paralysis and speech, perceptual, emotional, and cognitive impairment;
Whereas there is insufficient public knowledge of stroke prevention, treatment,
and rehabilitation;
Whereas between five hundred thousand and six hundred thousand Americans
are affected by a stroke each year;
Whereas between two million and three million American stroke survivors
have not fully regained their physical and mental abilities and remain
significantly disabled;
Whereas stroke is a sudden catastrophe that devastates families and routinely
robs survivors and family caregivers of the most rewarding years of their
lives;
Whereas stroke costs the United States between $12 and $13 billion annually
in medical treatment, rehabilitation, and lost potential economic output;
Whereas the National Stroke Association's mission is to provide the means to
reduce the incidence and effects of stroke through public and professional
education, community service and research; and
Whereas increased national awareness of stroke may stimulate greater interest,
concern, and participation by the American people and may lead to increased
research and to reducing the overall impact of stroke in the United States:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That May 1989 is designated as `National
 Stroke Awareness Month' and the President is authorized and requested to
 issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe
 such month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
