One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the period commencing on May 6, 1990, and ending on May 12,
1990, as
`National Drinking Water Week'.
Whereas water itself is God-given, and the drinking water that flows dependably
through our household taps results from the dedication of the men and women
who operate the public water systems of collection, storage, treatment,
testing, and distribution that insures that drinking water is available,
affordable, and of unquestionable quality;
Whereas the advances in health effects research and water analysis and
treatment technologies, in conjunction with the Safe Drinking Water Act
Amendments of 1986 (Public Law 99-339), could create major changes in the
production and distribution of drinking water;
Whereas this substance, which the public uses with confidence in so many
productive ways, is without doubt the single most important product in the
world and a significant issue of the future;
Whereas the public expects high-quality drinking water to always be there
when needed; and
Whereas the public continues to increase its demand for drinking water of
unquestionable quality: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the period commencing on May 6, 1990,
 and ending on May 12, 1990, is designated as `National Drinking Water Week',
 and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such period with appropriate
 ceremonies, activities, and programs designed to enhance public awareness
 of drinking water issues and public recognition of the difference that
 drinking water makes to the health, safety, and quality of the life we enjoy.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
