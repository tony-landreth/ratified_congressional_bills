 (a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDING- The Congress finds that the tourism industry must
 be recognized as a central element in the economic development and political
 stability of the Caribbean Basin region because of the potential that
 the industry has for increasing employment and foreign exchange earnings,
 establishing important linkages with other related sectors, and having a
 positive complementary effect on trade with the United States.
 (b) FEDERAL AGENCY PRIORITY- It is the sense of the Congress that increased
 tourism and related activities should be developed in the Caribbean Basin
 region as a central part of the Caribbean Basin Initiative program and, to
 that end, the appropriate agencies of the United States Government should
 assign a high priority to projects that promote the tourism industry in
 the Caribbean Basin.
 (c) STUDY- The Secretary of Commerce shall complete the study begun in 1986
 regarding tourism development strategies for the Caribbean Basin region. The
 study shall include--

 within the Caribbean Basin which the Commissioner of Customs considers
 appropriate for testing the extent to which the availability of preclearance
 operations can assist in the development of tourism.
 (b) RESTRICTIONS REGARDING PROGRAM-
 (1) The Commissioner of Customs may not consider a country within the
 Caribbean Basin to be appropriate for the testing referred to in subsection
 (a) if preclearance operations are currently carried out by the United
 States Customs Service in that country.
 (2) Preclearance operations may not be commenced in the country selected
 for testing under subsection (a) unless the Commissioner of Customs and
 the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization jointly certify that--
 (A) there exists a bilateral agreement between the United States Government
 and the government of such country which protects the interests of the
 United States and affords diplomatic protection to United States employees
 working at the preclearance location;
 (B) the facilities at the preclearance location conform to Federal Inspection
 Services standards and are suitable for the duties to be performed therein;

 and the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service appropriate
 search, seizure, and arrest authority; and

 establishing such operations in either Aruba or Jamaica. If the Commissioners
 determine, after full consultation with the governments of such countries,
 that it is not viable to establish pre-clearance operations in either
 Aruba or Jamaica, they shall so report to the Committee on Finance of the

 should, in consultation with the Agribusiness Promotion Council, coordinate
 with the Agency for International Development the development of programs to
 encourage improvements in the transportation and cargo handling infrastructure
 in these countries for the purpose of improving agricultural trade between
 these countries and the United States. Such programs should focus on
 improving distribution of agricultural commodities and products in these
 countries, and the phytosanitary institutions, quarantine capabilities, and

 and products.
SEC. 243. EXTENSION OF TRADE BENEFITS TO THE ANDEAN REGION.
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that:

 of the world's supply of cocaine.
 (2) The President and Congress have recognized that United States trade
 and economic policies play an important role in the overall United States
 antidrug strategy in the Andes.
 (3) The extension of special trade preferences for articles from the Andean
 region would help revitalize the national economies of the Andes and further
 United States antinarcotics policy in the region.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- The Congress urges the President to--
 (1) review the merits of extending the benefits provided under the Caribbean
 Basin Economic Recovery Act to the Andean region; and
 (2) continue to explore additional mechanisms to expand trade opportunities

TITLE IV--EXPORTS OF UNPROCESSED TIMBER
SEC. 487. SHORT TITLE.
 This title may be cited as the `Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage
 Relief Act of 1990'.
SEC. 488. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Timber is essential to the United States.
 (2) Forests, forest resources, and the forest environment are exhaustible
 natural resources that require efficient and effective conservation efforts.
 (3) In the interest of conserving those resources, the United States has
 set aside millions of acres of otherwise harvestable timberlands in the
 western United States, representing well over 100,000,000,000 board feet
 of otherwise harvestable timber.
 (4) In recent years, administrative, statutory, or judicial action has been
 taken to set aside an increased amount of otherwise harvestable timberlands
 for conservation purposes.
 (5) In the next few months and years, additional amounts of otherwise
 harvestable timberlands may be set aside for conservation purposes, pursuant
 to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the National Forest Management Act
 of 1976, or other expected statutory, administrative, and judicial actions.
 (6) There is evidence of a shortfall in the supply of unprocessed timber
 in the western United States.
 (7) There is reason to believe that any shortfall which may already exist
 may worsen unless action is taken.
 (8) In conjunction with the broad conservation actions expected in the
 next few months and years, conservation action is necessary with respect
 to exports of unprocessed timber.
 (b) PURPOSES- The purposes of this title are--
 (1) to promote the conservation of forest resources in conjunction with
 State and Federal resources management plans, and other actions or decisions,
 affecting the use of forest resources;
 (2) to take action essential for the acquisition and distribution of forest
 resources or products in short supply in the western United States;
 (3) to take action necessary, to meet the goals of Article XI 2.(a) of the
 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to ensure sufficient supplies of
 certain forest resources or products which are essential to the United States;
 (4) to continue and refine the existing Federal policy of restricting the
 export of unprocessed timber harvested from Federal lands in the western
 United States; and
 (5) to effect measures aimed at meeting these objectives in conformity with
 the obligations of the United States under the General Agreement on Tariffs
 and Trade.
SEC. 489. RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS OF UNPROCESSED TIMBER ORIGINATING FROM
FEDERAL LANDS.
 (a) PROHIBITION ON EXPORT OF UNPROCESSED TIMBER ORIGINATING FROM FEDERAL
 LANDS- No person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal
 lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States may export such
 timber from the United States, or sell, trade, exchange, or otherwise convey
 such timber to any other person for the purpose of exporting such timber from
 the United States, unless such timber has been determined under subsection
 (b) to be surplus to the needs of timber manufacturing facilities in the
 United States.
 (b) SURPLUSES-
 (1) DETERMINATIONS BY SECRETARY CONCERNED- The prohibition contained in
 subsection (a) shall not apply to specific quantities of grades and species
 of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands which the Secretary
 concerned determines to be surplus to domestic manufacturing needs.
 (2) PROCEDURES- Any determination under paragraph (1) shall be made in
 regulations issued in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States
 Code. Any such determination shall be reviewed at least once in every 3-year
 period. The Secretary concerned shall publish notice of such review in the
 Federal Register, and shall give the public an opportunity to comment on
 such review.
SEC. 490. LIMITATIONS ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF UNPROCESSED FEDERAL TIMBER FOR
UNPROCESSED TIMBER EXPORTED FROM PRIVATE LANDS.
 (a) DIRECT SUBSTITUTION- (1) Except as provided in subsection (c), no
 person may purchase directly from any department or agency of the United
 States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th
 meridian in the contiguous 48 States if--
 (A) such unprocessed timber is to be used in substitution for exported
 unprocessed timber originating from private lands; or
 (B) such person has, during the preceding 24-month period, exported
 unprocessed timber originating from private lands.
 (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)--
 (A) Federal timber purchased pursuant to a contract entered into between the
 purchaser and the Secretary concerned before the date on which regulations to
 carry out this subsection are issued under section 495 shall be governed by
 the regulations of the Secretary concerned in effect before such date that
 restrict the substitution of unprocessed timber originating from Federal
 lands for exported timber originating from private lands;
 (B) in the 1-year period beginning on the effective date of this title,
 any person who operates under a Cooperative Sustained Yield Unit Agreement,
 and who has an historic export quota shall be limited to entering into
 contracts under such a quota to a volume equal to not more than 66 percent
 of the person's historic export quota used during fiscal year 1989;
 (C) a person referred to in subparagraph (B) shall reduce the person's
 remaining substitution volume by an equal amount each year thereafter such
 that no volume is substituted under such a quota in fiscal year 1995 or
 thereafter; and
 (D) the 24-month period referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to
 any person who--
 (i) before the enactment of this Act, has, under an historic export quota
 approved by the Secretary concerned, purchased unprocessed timber originating
 from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in
 substitution for exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands;
 (ii) certifies to the Secretary concerned, within 3 months after the date
 of the enactment of this Act, that the person will, within 6 months after
 such date of enactment, cease exporting unprocessed timber originating from
 private lands; and
 (iii) ceases exports in accordance with such certification.
 (b) INDIRECT SUBSTITUTION-
 (1) IN GENERAL- Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person may, beginning
 21 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, purchase from any other
 person unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th
 meridian in the contiguous 48 States if such person would be prohibited
 from purchasing such timber directly from a department or agency of the
 United States. Acquisitions of western red cedar which are domestically
 processed into finished products to be sold into domestic or international
 markets are exempt from the prohibition contained in this paragraph.
 (2) EXCEPTIONS- (A) The Secretary of Agriculture shall, as soon as practicable
 but not later than 9 months after the date of the enactment of this Act,
 establish, by rule, a limited amount of unprocessed timber originating
 from Federal lands described in subparagraph (B) which may be purchased
 by a person otherwise covered by the prohibition contained in paragraph
 (1). Such limit shall equal--
 (i) the amount of such timber acquired by such person, based on the higher of
 the applicant's actual timber purchasing receipts or the appropriate Federal
 agency's records, during fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990, divided by 3, or
 (ii) 15 million board feet,
whichever is less, except that such limit shall not exceed such person's
proportionate share, with respect to all persons covered under this paragraph,
of 50 million board feet.
 (B) The Federal lands referred to in subparagraph (A) are Federal lands
 administered by the United States Forest Service Region 6 that are located
 north of the Columbia River from its mouth and east to its first intersection
 with the 119th meridian, and from that point north of the 46th parallel
 and east.
 (C) Any person may sell, trade, or otherwise exchange with any other person
 the rights obtained under subparagraph (A), except that such rights may not
 be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to persons already in possession
 of such rights obtained under subparagraph (A).
 (D) Federal timber purchased from Federal lands described in subparagraph
 (B) pursuant to a contract entered into between the purchaser and the
 Secretary of Agriculture before the date on which regulations to carry
 out this subsection are issued under section 495 shall be governed by the
 regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture in effect before such date that
 restrict the substitution of unprocessed timber originating from Federal
 lands for exported timber originating from private lands.
 (c) APPROVAL OF SOURCING AREAS-
 (1) IN GENERAL- The prohibitions contained in subsections (a) and (b)
 shall not apply with respect to the acquisition of unprocessed timber
 originating from Federal lands within a sourcing area west of the 100th
 meridian in the contiguous 48 States approved by the Secretary concerned
 under this subsection by a person who--
 (A) in the previous 24 months, has not exported unprocessed timber originating
 from private lands within the sourcing area; and
 (B) during the period in which such approval is in effect, does not export
 unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area.
The Secretary concerned may waive the 24-month requirement set forth in
subparagraph (A) for any person who, within 3 months after the date of the
enactment of this Act, certifies that, within 6 months after such date,
such person will, for a period of not less than 3 years, cease exporting
unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area.
 (2) REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATION- The Secretaries concerned shall, not
 later than 3 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, prescribe
 procedures to be used by a person applying for approval of a sourcing
 area under paragraph (1). Such procedures shall require, at a minimum,
 the applicant to provide--
 (A) information regarding the location of private lands from which such
 person has, within the previous year, harvested or otherwise acquired
 unprocessed timber which has been exported from the United States; and
 (B) information regarding the location of each timber manufacturing facility
 owned or operated by such person within the proposed sourcing area boundaries
 at which the applicant proposes to process timber originating from Federal
 lands.
The prohibition contained in subsection (a) shall not apply to a person before
the date which is 1 month after the procedures referred to in this paragraph
are prescribed. With respect to any person who submits an application in
accordance with such procedures by the end of the time period set forth in
the preceding sentence, the prohibition contained in subsection (a) shall
not apply to such person before the date on which the Secretary concerned
approves or disapproves such application.
 (3) GRANT OF APPROVAL- For each applicant, the Secretary concerned shall,
 on the record and after an opportunity for a hearing, not later than 4
 months after receipt of the application for a sourcing area, either approve
 or disapprove the application. The Secretary concerned may approve such
 application only if the Secretary determines that the area that is the
 subject of the application, in which the timber manufacturing facilities
 at which the applicant desires to process timber originating from Federal
 lands are located, is geographically and economically separate from any
 geographic area from which that person harvests for export any unprocessed
 timber originating from private lands. In making a determination referred
 to in this paragraph, the Secretary concerned shall consider equally the
 timber purchasing patterns, on private and Federal lands, of the applicant
 as well as other persons in the same local vicinity as the applicant,
 and the relative similarity of such purchasing patterns.
 (4) DENIAL OF APPLICATION- (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), and
 notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the 9-month period after
 receiving disapproval of an application submitted pursuant to this
 subsection, the applicant may purchase unprocessed timber originating
 from Federal lands in the area which is the subject of the application in
 an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the annual average of such person's
 purchases of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the same
 area during the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to submission of the
 application. In the subsequent 6-month period, such person may purchase
 not more than 25 percent of such annual average, after which time the
 prohibitions contained in subsection (a) shall fully apply.
 (B) If a person referred to in subparagraph (A) certifies to the Secretary
 concerned, within 90 days after receiving disapproval of such application,
 that such person shall, within 15 months after such disapproval, cease
 the export of unprocessed timber originating from private lands from the
 geographic area determined by the Secretary for which the application would
 have been approved, such person may continue to purchase unprocessed timber
 originating from Federal lands in the area which is the subject of the
 application, without being subject to the restrictions of subparagraph (A),
 except that such purchases during that 15-month period may not exceed 125
 percent of the annual average of such person's purchases of unprocessed timber
 originating from Federal lands in the same area during the 5 full fiscal
 years immediately prior to submission of the application which was denied.
 (C) Any person to whom subparagraph (B) applies may not, during the 15-month
 period after the person's application for sourcing area boundaries is denied,
 export unprocessed timber originating from private lands in the geographic
 area determined by the Secretary concerned for which the application would
 have been approved in amounts that exceed 125 percent of the annual average
 of such person's exports of unprocessed timber from such private lands during
 the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to submission of the application.
 (5) REVIEW OF DETERMINATIONS- Determinations made under paragraph (3) shall
 be reviewed, in accordance with the procedures prescribed in this title,
 not less often than every 5 years.
SEC. 491. RESTRICTION ON EXPORTS OF UNPROCESSED TIMBER FROM STATE AND OTHER
PUBLIC LANDS.
 (a) ORDER TO PROHIBIT THE EXPORT OF UNPROCESSED TIMBER ORIGINATING FROM
 STATE OR OTHER PUBLIC LANDS- Except as provided in subsection (e), the

 board feet or the total annual sales volume.
 (3) REPORT TO CONGRESS- Not later than June 1, 1995, the Secretary of
 Commerce, in conjunction with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior,
 shall issue a report to the Congress on the effects of the reallocation,
 as a result of the enactment of this title, of public lands timber resources
 to the domestic timber processing sector, the ability of the domestic timber
 processing sector to meet domestic demand for forest products, the volume of
 transshipment of timber originating from public lands across State borders,
 the effectiveness of rules issued and administered by States pursuant to
 this title, and trends in growth and productivity in the domestic timber
 processing sector.
 (c) BASIS FOR INCREASE IN VOLUME PROHIBITED FROM EXPORT- The Secretary of
 Commerce may increase the amount of unprocessed timber to be prohibited
 from export above the minimum amount specified in subsection (b)(2) (B) and
 (C), based on a determination that the purposes of this title have not been
 adequately met and that such an increase would further the purposes of this
 title. In making this determination, the Secretary shall consider--
 (1) actions or decisions taken, for the purpose of conserving or protecting
 exhaustible natural resources in the United States, which have affected
 the use or availability of forest products;
 (2) whether the volume of timber from public lands that is under contract
 has increased or decreased by an amount greater than 20 percent within the
 previous 12 months; and
 (3) the probable effects of unprocessed timber exports on the ability of
 timber mills to acquire unprocessed timber.
 (d) ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS-
 (1) DELAY OF SECRETARY'S ORDER- In the event that any order of the Secretary
 of Commerce under subsection (a) or its implementation is delayed for any
 reason, the prohibitions on exports under subsection (b) to which such
 order would apply shall apply in the absence of such order.
 (2) ADMINISTRATION BY STATES- Each State shall determine the species, grade,
 and geographic origin of unprocessed timber to be prohibited from export
 under subsection (b) and shall administer such prohibitions consistent with
 the intent of this title and ensure that the species, grades, and geographic
 origin of unprocessed timber prohibited from export is representative
 of the species, grades, and geographic origin of timber comprising such
 State's total timber sales program. The State is authorized to cooperate
 with Federal and State agencies with appropriate jurisdiction to further
 the intent of this title.
 (3) STATE REGULATIONS- (A) Except for States with annual sales of 400,000,000
 board feet or less upon the date of the enactment of this Act, the Governor
 of each State to which this title applies, or such other State official
 as the Governor may designate, shall, within 120 days after the date of
 the enactment of this Act, issue regulations to carry out the purposes of
 this section, the promulgation of which shall be consistent with section
 553 of title 5, United States Code. Such regulations in each State shall
 remain in effect until such time as the legislature of that State enacts
 such requirements as it deems appropriate to carry out this section. Before
 issuing such regulations, the Governor shall enter into formal consultation,
 concerning such regulations, with appropriate State officials and with a
 State Board of Natural Resources where such a board exists. When formulating
 regulations under this paragraph, the Governor shall take into account the
 intent of this title to effect a net increase in domestic processing of
 timber harvested from public lands consistent with all orders issued by
 the Secretary of Commerce under subsection (a).
 (B) The Governor of each State with annual sales of 400,000,000 board feet
 or less upon the date of the enactment of this Act, or such other State
 official as the Governor may designate, shall, within 120 days after the
 date of the enactment of this Act, issue regulations to carry out the
 purposes of this section. Until such regulations are issued in a State,
 the prohibitions contained in subsections (a) and (b) of section 490
 shall apply to unprocessed timber originating from public lands in that
 State to the same extent as such prohibitions apply to unprocessed timber
 originating from Federal lands, except that the provisions of subsection
 (c) of such section shall not apply.
 (4) PRIOR CONTRACTS- Nothing in this section shall apply to any contract
 for the purchase of unprocessed timber from public lands entered into before
 the effective date of a Secretary's order issued under subsection (a).
 (5) WESTERN RED CEDAR- Nothing in this section shall be construed to
 supersede the provisions of section 7(i) of the Export Administration Act
 of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2406(i)).
 (e) PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY- The President is authorized, after suitable
 notice and a public comment period of not less than 120 days, to suspend
 the provisions of this section if a panel of experts has reported to
 the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
 or a ruling issued under the formal dispute settlement proceeding provided
 under any other trade agreement finds, that the provisions of this section
 are in violation of, or inconsistent with, United States obligations under
 that trade agreement.
 (f) REMOVAL OR MODIFICATIONS OF STATE RESTRICTIONS- Based upon a determination
 that it is in the national economic interest, the President may remove
 or modify any prohibition on exports from public lands in a State if that
 State petitions the President to remove or modify such prohibition.
 (g) EFFECT OF PRIOR FEDERAL LAW- No provision of Federal law which
 imposes requirements with respect to the generation of revenue from State
 timberlands and was enacted before the enactment of this Act shall be
 construed to invalidate, supersede, or otherwise affect any action of a
 State or political subdivision of a State pursuant to this title.
 (h) SURPLUS TIMBER- The prohibitions on exports contained in orders of the
 Secretary of Commerce issued under subsection (a) shall not apply to specific
 quantities of grades and species of unprocessed timber originating from
 public lands which the Secretary concerned determines by rule to be surplus
 to the needs of timber manufacturing facilities in the United States. Any
 such determination may, by rule, be withdrawn by the Secretary concerned
 if the Secretary determines that the affected timber is no longer surplus
 to the needs of timber manufacturing facilities in the United States.
 (i) SUSPENSION OF PROHIBITIONS- Notwithstanding any other provision of
 this section, beginning on January 1, 1998, and annually thereafter, if
 the President finds, upon review of the purposes and implementation of
 this title, that the prohibitions on exports required by subsection (a) no
 longer promote the purposes of this title, then the President may suspend
 such prohibitions, except that such suspension shall not take effect until
 90 days after the President notifies the Congress of such finding.
 (j) EXISTING AUTHORITY NOT AFFECTED- Nothing in this title shall be
 construed to limit the authority of the President or the United States Trade
 Representative to take action authorized by law to respond appropriately
 to any measures taken by a foreign government in connection with this title.
SEC. 492. MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT.
 (a) MONITORING AND REPORTS- In accordance with regulations issued under
 this section--

 an opportunity for a hearing, that a person, with willful disregard for
 the prohibition contained in this title against exporting Federal timber,
 exported or caused to be exported unprocessed timber originating from Federal
 lands in violation of this title, such Secretary may assess against such
 person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3
 times the gross value of the unprocessed timber involved in the violation,
 whichever amount is greater.
 (2) OTHER VIOLATIONS- If the Secretary concerned finds, on the record and
 after an opportunity for a hearing, that a person has violated any provision
 of this title or any regulation issued under this title relating to lands
 which they administer (notwithstanding that such violation may not have
 caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber in violation of this title),
 such Secretary may--
 (A) assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $75,000
 for each violation if the Secretary determines that the person committed
 such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation;
 (B) assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $50,000
 for each violation if the Secretary determines that the person should have
 known that the action constituted a violation; or

 (3) PENALTIES NOT EXCLUSIVE; JUDICIAL REVIEW- A penalty assessed under this
 subsection shall not be exclusive of any other penalty provided by law and
 shall be subject to review in an appropriate United States district court.
 (d) ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES-
 (1) DEBARMENT- The head of the appropriate Federal department or agency under
 this title may debar any person who violates this title, or any regulation
 or contract issued under this title, from entering into any contract for
 the purchase of unprocessed timber from Federal lands for a period of not
 more than 5 years. Such person shall also be precluded from taking delivery
 of Federal timber purchased by another party for the period of debarment.
 (2) CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTS- The head of the appropriate Federal department
