One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of October 7, 1990, through October 13, 1990, as `Mental
Illness Awareness Week'.
Whereas mental illness is a problem of grave concern and consequence in
American society, widely but unnecessarily feared and misunderstood;
Whereas 31 to 41 million Americans annually suffer from clearly diagnosable
mental disorders involving significant disability with respect to employment,
attendance at school, or independent living;
Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are disabled for long periods of time
by schizophrenia, manic depressive disorder, and major depression;
Whereas 33 percent of the homeless suffer serious, chronic forms of mental
illness;
Whereas alcohol, drug, and mental disorders affect almost 19 percent of
American adults in any 6-month period;
Whereas mental illness in at least 12,000,000 children interferes with vital
developmental and maturational processes;
Whereas mental disorder-related deaths are estimated to be 33,000 annually,
with suicide accounting for at least 29,000 of those, although the real
number is thought to be at least three times higher;
Whereas our growing population of the elderly is particularly vulnerable to
mental illness;
Whereas estimates indicate that 1 in 10 AIDS patients will develop dementia
or other psychiatric problems as the first sign of the disease and that
as many as two-thirds of AIDS patients will show neuropsychiatric symptoms
before they die;
Whereas mental disorders result in staggering costs to society, estimated
to be in excess of $249,000,000,000 in direct treatment and support and
indirect costs to society, including lost productivity;
Whereas the Federal research budget committed to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse,
and Mental Health Administration represents only about 1 percent of the direct
clinical costs of caring for persons with alcohol, drug, and mental disorders;
Whereas mental illness is increasingly a treatable disability with excellent
prospects for amelioration and recovery when properly recognized;
Whereas families of mentally ill persons and those persons themselves have
begun to join self-help groups seeking to combat the unfair stigma of the
diseases, to support greater national investment in research, and to advocate
an adequate continuum of care from hospital to community;
Whereas in recent years there have been unprecedented major research
developments bringing new methods and technology to the sophisticated and
objective study of the functioning of the brain and its linkages to both
normal and abnormal behavior;
Whereas research in recent decades has led to a wide array of new and more
effective modalities of treatment (both somatic and psychosocial) for some
of the most incapacitating forms of mental illness (including schizophrenia,
major affective disorders, phobias, and phobic disorders);
Whereas appropriate treatment of mental illness has been demonstrated to
be cost effective in terms of restored productivity, reduced utilization of
other health services, and lessened social dependence; and
Whereas recent and unparalleled growth in scientific knowledge about mental
illness has generated the current emergence of a new threshold of opportunity
for future research advances and fruitful application to specific clinical
problems: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the 7-day period beginning October
 7, 1990, and ending October 13, 1990, is designated as `Mental Illness
 Awareness Week', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that
 week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
