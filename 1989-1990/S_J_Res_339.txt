Joint Resolution
To designate August 1, 1990, as `Helsinki Human Rights Day'.
Whereas August 1, 1990, is the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the

States of America, and Yugoslavia;
Whereas the participating States have committed themselves to balanced
progress in all areas of the Helsinki accords;
Whereas the Helsinki accords recognize the inherent relationship between
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the attainment of
genuine security;
Whereas the Helsinki accords also express the commitment of the participating
States to `respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom
of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as
to race, sex, language or religion';
Whereas the Helsinki accords also express the commitment of the participating
States to guarantee the effective exercise of human rights and fundamental
freedoms which derive from the inherent dignity of humanity and are essential
for the free and full development of that dignity;
Whereas the participating States have committed themselves to `protect and
create the conditions for the promotion of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic
and religious identity of national minorities on their territory,' as well
as to `respect the free exercise of rights by persons belonging to such
minorities and ensure their full equality with others';
Whereas the Helsinki accords also express the commitment of the participating
States in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms to `act in
conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' and to `fulfill
their obligations as set forth in the international declarations and agreements
in this field, including inter alia International Covenants on Human Rights,
by which they may be bound';

their laws, regulations, practices and policies conform with their obligations
under international law and are brought into harmony with the provisions of
the Declaration of Principles and other CSCE commitments';

States to `facilitate the freer and wider dissemination of information of
all kinds, to encourage cooperation in the field of information and the
exchange of information with other countries';

many signatory States have brought the human rights promises of Helsinki
closer to fruition;

yet fully implemented their obligations under Principle VII of the Helsinki
accords to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the
freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and under Basket III of
the Helsinki accords to promote free movement of people, ideas and information;
Whereas on January 19, 1989, representatives from the signatory States agreed
on the Concluding Document of the Vienna Follow-Up Meeting, a document which
has added clarity and precision to the obligations undertaken by the States
in signing the Helsinki accords;
Whereas by agreeing to the Concluding Document, the signatory States
`reaffirmed their commitment to the CSCE process and underlined its essential
role in increasing confidence, in opening up new ways for cooperation,
in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and thus
strengthening international security';
Whereas the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of the thirty-five
signatory States of the Helsinki accords has made major contributions to the
positive developments in Eastern and Central Europe, including greater respect
for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals and groups; and

excellent framework for the further development of genuine security and
cooperation among the participating States: Now, therefore, be it
