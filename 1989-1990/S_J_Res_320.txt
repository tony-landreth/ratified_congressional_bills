One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating July 2, 1990, as `National Literacy Day'.
Whereas literacy is a necessary tool for survival in our society;
Whereas thirty-five million Americans today read at a level which is less
than necessary for full survival needs;
Whereas there are twenty-seven million adults in the United States who cannot
read, whose resources are left untapped, and who are unable to offer their
full contribution to society;
Whereas illiteracy is growing rapidly, as two million three-hundred thousand
persons, including one million two-hundred thousand legal and illegal
immigrants, one million high school dropouts, and one hundred thousand
refugees, are added to the pool of illiterates annually;
Whereas the annual cost of illiteracy to the United States in terms of
welfare expenditures, crime, prison expenses, lost revenues, and industrial
and military accidents has been estimated at $225,000,000,000;
Whereas the competitiveness of the United States is eroded by the presence in
the workplace of millions of Americans who are functionally or technologically
illiterate;
Whereas there is a direct correlation between the number of illiterate adults
unable to perform at the standard necessary for available employment and
the money allocated to child welfare and unemployment compensation;
Whereas the percentage of illiterates in proportion to population size is
higher for blacks and Hispanics, resulting in increased economic and social
discrimination against these minorities;
Whereas the prison population represents the single highest concentration
of adult illiteracy;
Whereas one million children in the United States between the ages of
twelve and seventeen cannot read above a third grade level, 13 per centum
of all seventeen-year-olds are functionally illiterate, and 15 per centum
of graduates of urban high schools read at less than a sixth grade level;
Whereas 85 per centum of the juveniles who appear in criminal court are
functionally illiterate;
Whereas the 47 per centum illiteracy rate among black youths is expected
to increase;
Whereas one-half of all heads of households cannot read past the eighth grade
level and one-third of all mothers on welfare are functionally illiterate;
Whereas the cycle of illiteracy continues because the children of illiterate
parents are often illiterate themselves because of the lack of support they
receive from their home environment;
Whereas Federal, State, municipal, and private literacy programs have only
been able to reach 5 per centum of the total illiterate population;
Whereas it is vital to call attention to the problem of illiteracy, to
understand the severity of the problem and its detrimental effects on our
society, and to reach those who are illiterate and unaware of the free
services and help available to them; and
Whereas it is also necessary to recognize and thank the thousands of volunteers
who are working to promote literacy and provide support to the millions of
illiterates in need of assistance: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That July 2, 1990, is designated as
 `National Literacy Day', and the President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
