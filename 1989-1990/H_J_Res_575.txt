AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

Joint Resolution
To designate June 25, 1990, as `Korean War Remembrance Day'.
Whereas on June 25, 1950, the army of the Communist government of North
Korea initiated the Korean war by invading South Korea;
Whereas the United Nations military command created to respond to the attack
is the only example of such a command in the history of the United Nations;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces of the United States exerted executive
authority over and were the primary participants in the command;
Whereas in addition to the United States and South Korea, 20 other member
nations of the United Nations provided military forces to serve under the
United Nations military command;
Whereas after three years of active hostilities, the territorial integrity of
South Korea was restored, primarily through the efforts of the Armed Forces
of the United States;
Whereas the people of South Korea remain free and independent to this day;
Whereas more than 5,700,000 United States servicemen and servicewomen were
directly or indirectly involved in the war;
Whereas this Nation's casualties from the war included 54,246 dead, of
which 33,629 were battle deaths, 103,284 wounded, 8,177 listed as missing
or prisoners of war, and 328 prisoners of war still unaccounted for;
Whereas, although the Korean war has been called this Nation's `Forgotten
War', the war has not been forgotten by those who served or by the families
of those who served;
Whereas this Nation must never forget the sacrifices made by the servicemen
and servicewomen who served, fought, were injured, and died in the Korean war;
Whereas the Congress has enacted and the President has signed into law an
Act to establish a Korean War Veterans' Memorial in the Nation's Capital to
recognize and honor the service and sacrifice of this Nation's servicemen
and servicewomen who participated in the Korean war; and
Whereas on the 40th anniversary of the commencement of the Korean war, it is
appropriate to recognize, honor, and remember the service and sacrifices of the
servicemen and servicewomen of this Nation who preserved the independence of
South Korea by enduring the rigors of combat, a hostile climate, and other
trying conditions during that war: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That June 25, 1990, is designated as `Korean
 War Remembrance Day', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such
 day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to urge the departments
 and agencies of the United States and interested organizations, groups,
 and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half staff on June
 25, 1990, in honor of the Americans who died as a result of service in the
 Korean war.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
