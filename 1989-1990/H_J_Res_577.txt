AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating the month of November 1990 as `National American Indian Heritage
Month'.
Whereas American Indians were the original inhabitants of the lands that
now constitute the United States of America;
Whereas American Indians have made an essential and unique contribution to
our Nation, not the least of which is the contribution of most of the land
which now comprises these United States;
Whereas American Indians have made essential contributions to the world,
including prehistoric cultivation and harvesting of corn and sweet potatoes;
Whereas the people of the United States should be reminded of the assistance
given to the early European visitors to North America by the ancestors
of today's American Indians, including knowledge and training provided to
the pilgrims in survival, hunting, and cultivation, and fertilization of
indigenous crops;
Whereas the people and Government of the United States should be reminded
of the assistance given to this country's Founding Fathers by the ancestors
of today's American Indians, including the support the original inhabitants
provided to George Washington and his troops during the winter of 1777-1778,
which they spent in Valley Forge;
Whereas the people and Government of the United States should be reminded
that certain concepts such as freedom of speech, the separation of powers
in government, and the balance of power within government, all of which
were found in the political systems of various American Indian nations,
influenced the formulation of the Government of the United States of America;
Whereas the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives believe that
a resolution and proclamation of the nature requested in this resolution can
encourage activities which provide positive benefits of enhanced self-esteem,
pride, and self-awareness to young American Indians;
Whereas the approaching 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus to the Western Hemisphere provides an opportunity for the people of
the United States to consider and reflect on our Nation's current relationship
with our American Indians; and
Whereas the month of November concludes the traditional harvest season of
American Indians and was generally a time of celebration and giving thanks:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the month of November 1990 is
 designated as `National American Indian Heritage Month', and the President
 is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon Federal,
 State, and local governments, interested groups and organizations, and the
 people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs,
 ceremonies, and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
