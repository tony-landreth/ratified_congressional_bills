One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the month of September 1990 as `International Visitors' Month'.
Whereas the United States Information Agency conducts educational and cultural
exchange programs that bring current and future foreign leaders to the United
States, often for their first visit;
Whereas the experiences of these visitors affect attitudes and decisions
regarding our country and international relations in general;
Whereas the success of these programs depends on the visitors' seeing American
democracy in all its openness and diversity;
Whereas such broad and meaningful exposure requires thousands of volunteers,
who open their homes, businesses, and communities to more than 5,000 visitors
each year;
Whereas such volunteer efforts are coordinated by the National Council for
International Visitors, comprised of 103 not-for-profit community organizations
throughout the United States and 42 national programming agencies;
Whereas these international visits not only enrich the United States and
the world in cultural, social, and human terms, but also provide the United
States and foreign nations opportunities in international trade, commerce,
and economic development; and
Whereas the continuing vitality and growing value of such programs depend
upon community awareness and support: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That September 1990 is designated as
 `International Visitors' Month'. The President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe that month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
