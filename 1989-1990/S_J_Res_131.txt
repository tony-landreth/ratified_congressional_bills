One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate November 1989 as `National Diabetes Month'.
Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of death by disease in the United States;
Whereas diabetes affects over eleven million Americans, of whom almost six
million are not aware of their illness;
Whereas diabetes costs the Nation $20,400,000,000 annually in health care
costs, disability payments, and increased mortality due to diabetes;
Whereas up to 85 per centum of all cases of noninsulin dependent diabetes may
be prevented through greater public understanding, awareness, and education;
Whereas diabetes is particularly prevalent among black Americans, Hispanic
Americans, Native Americans, and women; and
Whereas diabetes is a leading cause of new blindness, kidney disease, heart
disease, strokes, birth defects, and foot and leg amputations, all of which
can be reduced by better public understanding and awareness of diabetes:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the month of November 1989 is designated
 as `National Diabetes Month'. The President is authorized and requested
 to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to
 observe that month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
