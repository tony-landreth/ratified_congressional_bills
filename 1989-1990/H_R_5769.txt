TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION ON THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES
ACT OF 1965
SEC. 101. DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
 Section 2 of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of
 1965 (20 U.S.C. 951) is amended to read as follows:
`DECLARATION OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
 `SEC. 2. The Congress finds and declares the following:
 `(1) The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United
 States.
 `(2) The encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in
 the humanities and the arts, while primarily a matter for private and local
 initiative, are also appropriate matters of concern to the Federal Government.
 `(3) An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and
 technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great
 branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better
 understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better
 view of the future.
 `(4) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore
 foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the
 humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located
 masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.
 `(5) It is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government
 to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of the
 humanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and
 their organizations. In doing so, the Government must be sensitive to the
 nature of public sponsorship. Public funding of the arts and humanities
 is subject to the conditions that traditionally govern the use of public
 money. Such funding should contribute to public support and confidence in
 the use of taxpayer funds. Public funds provided by the Federal Government
 must ultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines.
 `(6) The arts and the humanities reflect the high place accorded by the
 American people to the nation's rich cultural heritage and to the fostering of
 mutual respect for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and groups.
 `(7) The practice of art and the study of the humanities require constant
 dedication and devotion. While no government can call a great artist or
 scholar into existence, it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal
 Government to help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom
 of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also the material conditions
 facilitating the release of this creative talent.
 `(8) The world leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest
 solely upon superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly
 founded upon worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation's high qualities
 as a leader in the realm of ideas and of the spirit.
 `(9) Americans should receive in school, background and preparation in the
 arts and humanities to enable them to recognize and appreciate the aesthetic
 dimensions of our lives, the diversity of excellence that comprises our
 cultural heritage, and artistic and scholarly expression.
 `(10) It is vital to a democracy to honor and preserve its multicultural
 artistic heritage as well as support new ideas, and therefore it is essential
 to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that
 support their work.
 `(11) To fulfill its educational mission, achieve an orderly continuation of
 free society, and provide models of excellence to the American people, the
 Federal Government must transmit the achievement and values of civilization
 from the past via the present to the future, and make widely available the
 greatest achievements of art.
 `(12) In order to implement these findings and purposes, it is desirable
 to establish a National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.'.
