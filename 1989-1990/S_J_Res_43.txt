AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating April 9, 1989, as `National Former Prisoners of War Recognition
Day'.
Whereas the United States has fought in many wars;
Whereas thousands of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who
served in such wars were captured by the enemy and held as prisoners of war;
Whereas many such prisoners of war were subjected to brutal and inhumane
treatment by their captors in violation of international codes and customs
for the treatment of prisoners of war and died, or were disabled, as a result
of such treatment;
Whereas in 1985, the United States Congress (in Public Law 99-145) directed
the Department of Defense to issue a medal to former prisoners of war in
recognition and commemoration of their great sacrifices in service to our
Nation; and
Whereas these great sacrifices by former prisoners of war and their families
deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That April 9, 1989, is designated as
 `National Former Prisoners of War Recognition Day' in honor of the members
 of the Armed Forces of the United States who have been held as prisoners of
 war, and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to commemorate such days with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
