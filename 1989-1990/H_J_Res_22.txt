Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning March 6, 1989, as `Federal Employees
Recognition Week'.
Whereas Federal employees serve the people of the United States by enabling
the Federal Government to carry out its duties in an efficient manner;
Whereas more than 3,000,000 individuals are employed by the Federal Government;
Whereas many valuable services performed by Federal employees are often
inadequately recognized by Federal officials and by the people of the United
States; and
Whereas Federal employees should be commemorated for the contributions
that they make to the efficient operation of the Federal Government: Now,
therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning March 6, 1989, is
 designated `Federal Employees Recognition Week', and the President of the
 United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
