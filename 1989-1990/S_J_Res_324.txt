Joint Resolution
Designating June 2 through 8, 1991, as a `Week for the National Observance
of the
50th Anniversary of World War II'.
Whereas the brave men and women of the United States of America made tremendous
sacrifices during World War II to save the world from tyranny and aggression;
Whereas the winds of freedom and democracy sweeping the globe today spring
from the principles for which over 400,000 Americans gave their lives in
World War II;
Whereas World War II and the events that led up to that war must be understood
in order that we may better understand our own times, and more fully appreciate
the reasons why eternal vigilance against any form of tyranny is so important;
Whereas the World War II era, as reflected in its family life, industry,
and entertainment, was a unique period in American history, and epitomized
our Nation's philosophy of hard work, courage, and tenacity in the face
of adversity;
Whereas, between 1990 and 1995, over 9,000,000 American veterans of World
War II will hold reunions and conferences and otherwise commemorate the 50th
anniversaries of various events relating to World War II; and
Whereas June 4, 1990, marks the anniversary of the Battle of Midway and June
6, 1990, marks the anniversary of the D-Day battle: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That June 2 through June 8, 1991, is
 designated as a `Week for the National Observance of the 50th Anniversary
 of World War II', and the President is authorized and requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the
 week with appropriate activities and ceremonies.
