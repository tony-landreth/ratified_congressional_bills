H.J.RES.363
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
To designate 1989 as `United States Customs Service 200th Anniversary Year'.
Whereas July 31, 1989, marks the 200th anniversary of the signing by
President George Washington of legislation establishing the United States
Customs Service;
Whereas the controls on imports and exports and on shipping and trade, deemed
essential by the founders of the Republic would have been impossible without
implementation by an honest, resourceful, and efficient Customs Service;
Whereas the Collector of Customs, the Customs House, and the Customs officer
have stood for 200 years as the symbols of Federal authority in the ports
and on the waterfronts;
Whereas after 200 years the ever more complex demands of our economy and our
civilization require the Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury to
remain alert and ready to perform on short notice a widening variety of tasks;
Whereas the men and women of the United States Customs Service have been the
first line of defense against the entry into the United States of illicit
drugs and other contraband goods;
Whereas the United States Customs Service has protected the economic well
being of the Nation against predatory trade practices and violation of
intellectual property rights;
Whereas the United States Customs Service is one of the oldest of the Federal
agencies, having been created by the 5th Act of the 1st Congress; and
Whereas the United States Customs Service was the source of the creation
of many Federal agencies, is the principal United States border agency,
and enforces all laws of the United States at our border: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That 1989 is designated as `United States
 Customs Service 200th Anniversary Year', and the President of the United
 States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the
 people of the United States to observe the year with appropriate ceremonies
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
