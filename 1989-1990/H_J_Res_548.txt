Joint Resolution
Designating the week of August 19 through 25, 1990, as `National Agricultural
Research Week'.
Whereas the Act to establish a Department of Agriculture, enacted May 15,
1862, which placed the primary responsibility for scientific experimentation
in agriculture with the Department of Agriculture, provided the basis for the
development of the modern nationwide cooperative agricultural research system;
Whereas past public commitments to agricultural research in the United States
provided the scientists and facilities essential to the development of the
most successful technological advancements known to the science of agriculture;
Whereas the American public has been the major beneficiary of agricultural
research through a broad array of food, fiber, and forest products unsurpassed
in cost, availability, quality, safety, and convenience; and
Whereas the agricultural production and marketing system of the United States
faces urgent challenges from increased international competition for markets,
consumer demands for healthier and safer foods, the need to adjust to the
uncertainties of climatic change, appeals to conserve the natural resources of
the Nation and protect the environment, and the need to improve the economic
well-being of rural America: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of August 19 through 25, 1990,
 is designated as `National Agricultural Research Week'. The President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on the people of
 the United States to observe that week with proper ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
