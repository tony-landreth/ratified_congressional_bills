Joint Resolution
To authorize and request the President to designate May 1990 as `National
Physical Fitness and Sports Month'.
Whereas there is an increase in the number of adults in our country who
regularly participate in exercise and sports;
Whereas the number of physically active men and women continues to grow
rapidly, especially since the 1970s;
Whereas there is great support for the importance of daily exercise for
youth and children regardless of physical capabilities or limitations;
Whereas there is continued growth in senior citizens' physical activity
participation which increases their enjoyment and quality of life;
Whereas today we recognize that physical activity is an important part of
daily life for children, adults, and senior citizens of both sexes;
Whereas physical activity is vital to good health and is a rich source of
pleasure and personal satisfaction;
Whereas our physical fitness and sports programs are one of the primary
means by which we strengthen our bodies and refresh our spirits; and
Whereas it is essential that we make fitness and sports programs increasingly
available in the schools, at the workplace, and during leisure time so that
all of our citizens will be able to experience the joys and benefits they
offer: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation designating the month of May 1990 as
 `National Physical Fitness and Sports Month', and to call upon Federal,
 State, and local government agencies, and the people of the United States
 to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
