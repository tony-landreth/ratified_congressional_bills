One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate October 1-31, 1991, as `Community Center Month'.
Whereas Community Centers are large and complex cultural, social, and
recreational institutions dedicated to preserving the well-being of a vital
and vibrant segment of the United States;
Whereas there are Community Centers, branches, and camps serving a large
clientele of people across the continent;
Whereas Community Centers feature programs and services for all age groups,
from infants through the elderly, and for people with disabilities and
special needs;
Whereas Community Centers serve as gathering places for peoples of all
denominations and offer a rich and varied program of educational and cultural
opportunities;
Whereas the first Community Centers came into being during the second half
of the nineteenth century to provide social, recreational, and intellectual
activities for community members in the United States;
Whereas, as the nineteenth century progressed into the twentieth and the
United States became a haven for hundreds of thousands of peoples fleeing
the oppression and pogroms of Eastern Europe, Community Centers turned
their energies and attention to the enormous task of acculturating the new
immigrants, teaching them English and the meaning of United States citizenship;
Whereas after the influx diminished and Community Centers  evolved once
again into institutions dedicated to preserving good citizenship through
educational, cultural, social, and recreational programs; and
Whereas, as Community Centers  enter their second century of providing
service, it is most fitting that we recognize their important contribution
to the fabric of life in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
  of America in Congress assembled, That October 1-31, 1991, is designated
  as `Community Center Month', and the President of the United States is
  authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people
  of the United States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies
  and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
