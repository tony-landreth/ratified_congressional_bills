 Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (done
 at Geneva, June 17, 1925), as well as other international treaties;

 opponents, forced relocation and deportation, denial of nearly all civil
 and political rights such as freedom of association, assembly, speech,
 and the press, and the imprisonment, torture, and execution of children;

 Iraqi Kurdistan;

 agency of the United States) as a result of loans made before October 1,
 1990, by the United States (or any of its agencies) to Egypt under the Arms
 Export Control Act (all such loans being hereinafter collectively referred
 to as the `AECA Loans').
 (3) Section 518 of this Act, section 620(q) of the Foreign Assistance Act
 of 1961, and any other provision that similarly restricts the furnishing
 of assistance to countries in default on payment to the United States of
 principal or interest shall not apply during the moratorium described in
 paragraph (1) with respect to amounts owed by Egypt under the AECA Loans.
 (4) Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with, or otherwise diminish,
 the obligation of the Secretary of Defense as guarantor with respect to
 the AECA Loans.
 (b) DEBT CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- As soon as feasible
 after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall--
 (1) issue to the Secretary of the Treasury sufficient notes or other
 obligations to purchase all notes made by Egypt evidencing amounts owed
 by Egypt to the United States (or any agency of the United States), other
 than amounts already owed to the Secretary of Defense, as a result of AECA
 Loans; and
 (2) purchase all such notes made by Egypt, such purchase being considered
 to discharge the responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense as guarantor
 of such notes.
 (c) PRESIDENTIAL REPORT ON THE REAL VALUE OF EGYPTIAN DEBT OWED TO THE
 UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL MILITARY DEBT REDUCTION AUTHORITY- After
 the Department of Defense has taken the actions described in subsection (b)--
 (1) the President shall submit a report to Congress in which he determines
 the value of the AECA Loans and all other loans owed by Egypt to the United
 States based on realistic payment expectations as of October 1, 1990, and
 an explanation of the factors considered by the President in determining
 the value; and
 (2) after the President has submitted the report to Congress provided for
 in paragraph (1), the President may--
 (A) reduce the amount owed by Egypt to the Secretary of Defense to an amount
 that equals the value of the AECA Loans as determined by the President in
 the report described in paragraph (1);
 (B) direct the Secretary of Defense to amend, modify or otherwise alter
 the notes described in subsection (a)(2) so that the amended, modified or
 altered notes (the `amended notes') evidence a principal amount owed by
 Egypt to the Secretary of Defense equal to the value of the AECA Loans as
 determined under paragraph (1), and contain such terms and conditions as
 the President may determine consistent with the purposes of this section,
 provided that such terms and conditions shall not--
 (i) reflect any interest accrued in respect of the period between October 1,
 1990, and March 31, 1991; and
 (ii) require Egypt to make any payment before March 31, 1991; and
 (C) reduce the amount owed by the Secretary of Defense under all notes or
 other obligations issued by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the
 Treasury that are related to any guarantees of any AECA Loans (including all
 notes or other obligations issued under subsection (b)) by multiplying it by
 a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the value of the AECA Loans as
 determined under paragraph (1), and the denominator of which shall equal the
 sum of (i) the amount owed by the Secretary of Defense under notes issued
 to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subsection (b)(1), plus (ii)
 the amount owed by Egypt as a result of the AECA Loans to the Secretary of
 Defense as of October 1, 1990, plus (iii) the amount that Egypt would have
 owed as a result of the AECA Loans to the Secretary of Defense in respect
 of the period beginning October 1, 1990, and ending immediately before the
 President makes the reduction described in subsection (c)(2)(A).
 The military debt reduction authority provided by this subsection shall be
 limited such that no reduction shall result in a decrease in the principal
 value of the AECA Loans below the discounted net present value which
 would result from a restructuring of the AECA Loans according to the terms
 and conditions which apply to the loans of the International Development
 Association (principal shall be repayable over 40 years and shall bear no
 interest, and there shall be a 10 year grace period after which period 2 per
 centum of the loan shall be repaid annually for a period of 10 years, and
 4 per centum of the loan shall be repaid annually during the remaining years).
 (d) DEBT CANCELLATION AUTHORITY- (1) The President, notwithstanding any
 other provision of law, in the context of the multilateral debt negotiations
 provided for in this section may reduce to zero the amended notes (in the
 manner specified in subsection (e)(2) (A) and (B)) only if other major holders
 of Egyptian military debt agree to equal or comparable reductions. If such
 other creditors do not agree to comparable reductions in their Egyptian
 military debt the President shall so report to Congress.
 (2) If the President reports to Congress under paragraph (1) then he may
 further determine that it is essential to the national security interests
 of the United States to unilaterally cancel the requirement of Egypt to
 repay the United States for such Egyptian military debt.
 (e) CONSIDERATIONS- (1) In making this determination under subsection
 (d)(2), the President may consider--
 (A) the unique nature of Egypt's contribution to Desert Shield, and its
 leadership role in supporting international efforts in the face of Iraqi
 aggression in the Arabian Peninsula;
 (B) the impact on the Egyptian economy of the events surrounding the Iraqi
 aggression;
 (C) the long-term prospects for economic growth and stability in Egypt,
 and the effect on those prospects of such a determination;
 (D) the role that Egypt's assumption of FMS debt played in furtherance of
 the common security interests of Egypt and the United States, and the role if
 any that such debt was expected to have relative to other forms of official
 debt in generating income and promoting growth in the Egyptian economy;
 (E) the willingness of other countries to participate in efforts to address
 the issue of official Egyptian military debt on a multilateral basis; and
 (F) any other national security interests of the United States.
 (2) If the President determines in the report provided for in subsection (d)
 that doing so is essential to the success of Desert Shield, or to enhance
 peace and stability in the Middle East, then he is hereby authorized to
 reduce to zero--
 (A) the amount owed by Egypt to the Secretary of Defense under the amended
 notes; and
 (B) the amount owed by the Secretary of Defense under all notes or other
 obligations issued by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the
 Treasury that are related to any guarantees of any AECA Loans, including
 all notes or other obligations issued under subsection (b)(1).
 (f) The President may carry out the purposes of this section notwithstanding
 any other provision of law.

 legitimate defense requirements of eligible allies and friends. Accordingly,

INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT
 SEC. 599E. (a) The Congress finds that--
 (1) the international community has defined as criminal conduct in
 various international conventions, certain acts such as war crimes, crimes
 against humanity, torture, piracy and crimes on board commercial vessels,
 aircraft hijacking and sabotage of aircraft, crimes against diplomats and
 other internationally protected persons, hostage-taking, and illicit drug
 cultivation and trafficking;
 (2) in spite of these international conventions, the effective prosecution
 of those who commit criminal acts has been seriously obstructed in certain
 cases because of problems of extradition and differences between the legal
 and judicial systems of individual nations;
 (3) the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice extends only to
 cases involving governments, and not to individual criminal cases;
 (4) the concept of an international criminal court has been under
 consideration in the United Nations and other international fora for many
 years, including proposals and reviews undertaken in 1990 by the United
 Nations General Assembly, the International Law Commission, and the Eighth
 United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of
 Offenders;
 (5) the international military tribunals established in Nuremburg, Germany,
 and Tokyo, Japan, following World War II also establish a precedent for
 international criminal tribunals; and
 (6) there is growing movement among nations of the world to formulate their

 (b) It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) the United States should explore the need for the establishment of an
 International Criminal Court on a universal or regional basis to assist
 the international community in dealing more effectively with criminal acts
 defined in international conventions; and
 (2) the establishment of such a court or courts for the more effective
 prosecution of international criminals should not derogate from established
 standards of due process, the rights of the accused to a fair trial and
 the sovereignty of individual nations.
 (c) The President shall report to the Congress by October 1, 1991, the results
 of his efforts in regard to the establishment of an International Criminal
 Court to deal with criminal acts defined in international conventions.
 (d) The Judicial Conference of the United States shall report to the Congress

POLAND
 SEC. 599G. (a)(1) The freely-elected Government of Poland has reshaped the
 country's economic policies with great courage and consistency in a manner
 that will foster the establishment of a functioning market economy in the
 near future;
 (2) the Government of Poland and people alike have proven their willingness to
 endure economic hardships, such as a marked drop in the standard of living,
 in employment levels, and in the nation's industrial output, in order to
 create the necessary conditions for a comprehensive economic reform;
 (3) the economic program is based on the recognition of the Polish authorities
 that a stable and easily convertible currency is paramount to the economic
 transformation of Poland;
 (4) inflation in Poland has actually declined and the budget deficit been
 reduced as a consequence of the determination of Poland's policy makers;
 (5) private ownership of the means of production has been achieved on a
 broad basis;
 (6) the continued success of economic reform hinges upon tangible improvements
 in the economic conditions for each and every citizen;
 (7) private sector companies from the United States and elsewhere have
 responded very favorably to the Government of Poland's determination to
 bring about meaningful reform;
 (8) the greatest challenge for the new government is to service the staggering
 debt run up by the previous communist regime; and
 (9) the servicing of this debt out of current revenues endangers a successful
 completion of the reform process because it consumes a large part of the
 resources needed for economic expansion: Now, therefore, be it
 (b) The sense of the Congress that--
 (1) Poland's debt service should be reduced in the appropriate manner to
 safeguard the promising reform concept;
 (2) any solution of this problem should entail a broad range of approaches,
 such as outright debt reduction, debt service reduction, and lengthening
 of maturities, as well as an infusion of new capital;
 (3) the Western governments, which are Poland's major creditors, should
 take speedy action in this area and private banks should also be prepared
 to contribute their share to this effort of reducing Poland's debt in order
 to allow the newly democratized country to bring its market reform program
 to a successful conclusion; and
 (4) the President should undertake the appropriate measures on the part
 of the United States to bring the deliberations in the Paris Club to a
 favorable decision on the issue of reducing Poland's debt.

 in working with the United States and other nations toward a settlement of
