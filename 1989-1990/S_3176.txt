SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.
 (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) Threats to human health and environmental quality are increasingly
 complex, involving a wide range of conventional and toxic contaminants in
 the air and water and on the land.
 (2) There is growing evidence of international environmental problems, such
 as global warming, ocean pollution, and declines in species diversity, and
 that these problems pose serious threats to human health and the environment
 on a global scale.
 (3) Environmental problems represent as significant a threat to the quality
 of life and the economic vitality of urban areas as they do the natural
 balance of rural areas.
 (4) Effective response to complex environmental problems requires
 understanding of the natural and built environment, awareness of environmental
 problems and their origins (including those in urban areas), and the skills
 to solve these problems.
 (5) Development of effective solutions to environmental problems and effective
 implementation of environmental programs requires a well educated and trained,
 professional work force.
 (6) Current Federal efforts to inform and educate the public concerning
 the natural and built environment and environmental problems are not adequate.
 (7) Existing Federal support for development and training of professionals
 in environmental fields is not sufficient.
 (8) The Federal Government, acting through the Environmental Protection
 Agency, should work with local education institutions, State education
 agencies, not-for-profit educational and environmental organizations,
 noncommercial educational broadcasting entities, and private sector interests
 to support development of curricula, special projects, and other activities,
 to increase understanding of the natural and built environment and to
 improve awareness of environmental problems.
 (9) The Federal Government, acting through the coordinated efforts of its
 agencies and with the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency,
 should work with local education institutions, State education agencies,
 not-for-profit educational and environmental organizations, noncommercial
 educational broadcasting entities, and private sector interests to develop
 programs to provide increased emphasis and financial resources for the
 purpose of attracting students into environmental engineering and assisting
 them in pursuing the programs to complete the advanced technical education
 required to provide effective problem solving capabilities for complex
 environmental issues.
 (10) Federal natural resource agencies such as the United States Forest
 Service have a wide range of environmental expertise and a long history of
 cooperation with educational institutions and technology transfer that can
 assist in furthering the purposes of the Act.
 (b) POLICY- It is the policy of the United States to establish and support
 a program of education on the environment, for students and personnel
 working with students, through activities in schools, institutions of
 higher education, and related educational activities, and to encourage
 postsecondary students to pursue careers related to the environment.
