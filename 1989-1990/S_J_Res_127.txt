One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Designating Labor Day weekend, September 2 through 4, 1989, as `National
Drive for
Life Weekend'.
Whereas drunk driving is the most frequently committed crime in the United
States, with arrests for driving while intoxicated totaling more than three
times the number of arrests for all violent crimes combined;
Whereas one individual in the United States was killed every twenty-two
minutes in a drunk-driving-related crash in 1988, an average of sixty-five
individuals each day;
Whereas more than twenty-three thousand individuals were killed in the United
States in drunk-driving-related crashes in 1988;
Whereas two out of every five individuals in the United States will be
involved in a drunk-driving-related crash at some point in their lives;
Whereas the estimates of the economic costs of drunk driving in the United
States are as high as $24 billion;
Whereas Drive for Life is a public awareness campaign which asks all Americans
to pledge to be responsible by driving sober on the Drive for Life Day and
thereby demonstrate a commitment to reduce significantly the tragedies of
drunk driving, and which serves to educate the public about the dangers of
drunk driving;
Whereas Americans are also asked to turn on their headlights while driving
on Drive for Life Day as a remembrance of those killed by drunk driving;
Whereas on the second annual National Drive for Life Day, the toll of
individuals killed in drunk-driving-related crashes in the United States was
28.6 per centum lower than the number of deaths due to drunk-driving-related
crashes on Labor Day weekend Saturday, in 1987, reflecting the success of
this campaign;
Whereas the second annual National Drive for Life campaign featured
endorsements from all fifty Governors, more than two hundred and seventy-five
mayors, and all fifty State police departments;
Whereas the third annual National Drive for Life Day will occur on September
2, 1989, the Saturday of the Labor Day weekend, when drunk-driving-related
crashes are traditionally at their peak: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the Labor Day weekend beginning on
 September 2, 1989, is designated as `National Drive for Life Weekend'. The
 President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling on
 the people of the United States to observe that weekend with a pledge to
 be responsible by driving sober and encouraging others to do the same.
