Joint Resolution
Acknowledging the sacrifices that military families have made on behalf of
the Nation and designating November 20, 1989, as `National Military Families
Recognition Day'.
Whereas Congress recognizes and supports Department of Defense policies to
recruit, train, equip, retain, and field a military force that is capable
of preserving peace and protecting the vital interests of the United States
and its allies;
Whereas military families shoulder the responsibility of providing emotional
support for their service members;
Whereas in times of war and military action military families have demonstrated
their patriotism through their steadfast support and commitment to the Nation;
Whereas the emotional and mental readiness of United States military personnel
around the world is tied to the well-being and satisfaction of their families;
Whereas the quality of life that the Armed Forces provide to military families
is a key factor in the retention of military personnel;
Whereas the people of the United States are truly indebted to military families
for facing adversities, including extended separations from their service
members, frequent household moves due to reassignments, and restrictions on
their employment and educational opportunities;
Whereas 68 percent of officers and 48 percent of enlisted personnel in the
Armed Forces are married;
Whereas families of active duty military personnel (including individuals
other than spouses or children) account for more than two million seven
hundred thousand of the more than four million eight hundred thousand in the
active duty community, and spouses and children of members of the Reserves
in paid status account for more than one million five hundred thousand of
the more than two million seven hundred thousand in the Reserves community;
Whereas spouses, children, and other dependents living abroad with members of
the Armed Forces total nearly five hundred thousand and these family members
at times face feelings of cultural isolation and financial hardship; and
Whereas military families are devoted to the overall mission of the Department
of Defense and have accepted the role of the United States as the military
leader and protector of the free world: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) Congress acknowledges and appreciates the commitment and devotion of
 present and former military families and the sacrifices that such families
 have made on behalf of the Nation; and
 (2) November 20, 1989, is designated as `National Military Families
 Recognition Day', and the President is authorized and requested to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such
 day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
