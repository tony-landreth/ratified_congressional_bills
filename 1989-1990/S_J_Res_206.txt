One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Calling for the United States to encourage immediate negotiations toward
a new agreement among Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, for the full
protection of Antarctica as a global ecological commons.
Whereas Antarctica, like the great oceans and the atmosphere, is a part of
the global commons;
Whereas the Antarctic region, including the continent and the Southern Ocean,
is a fragile ecosystem that supports an amazing abundance of life, and is,
in turn, crucial to other life on Earth;
Whereas Antarctica is a critical area in the study and documentation of
global change;
Whereas negotations of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have resulted
in the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities;
Whereas the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource
Activities, while requiring consideration of environmental impacts prior to
allowing minerals development in Antarctica, does not guarantee preservation
of the Antarctic environment; and
Whereas the challenge to humankind is to ensure that Antarctica is stewarded
in a manner that conserves its unique environment and preserves its value
for scientific research: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That--
 (1) Antarctica is a global ecological commons, and should, therefore, be
 subject to a new agreement or protocol which supplement the Antarctic Treaty
 of 1959, providing for comprehensive environmental protection of Antarctica,
 and which should for an indefinite period establish Antarctica as a region
 closed to commercial minerals development and related activities;
 (2) under such new agreements, information about mineral or other resources
 in Antarctica should be obtained under strictly controlled arrangements
 and should be openly shared in the international scientific community;
 (3) the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities,
 though a considerable step forward, does not guarantee protection of the
 fragile environment of Antarctica and could actually stimulate movement
 toward commercial exploitation;
 (4) pending the negotiation and entry into force of the new agreements
 referred to in paragraph (1) the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic
 Mineral Resource Activities should not be presented to the Senate for advice
 and consent to ratification;
 (5)  until such new agreements enter into force, the United States should
 support the interim restraint measures currently in effect among the
 Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty; and
 (6) the negotiation of a new agreements referred to in paragraph (1) should
 be fully supported by the United States at the November 1990 meeting of
 the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties in Santiago, Chile.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
