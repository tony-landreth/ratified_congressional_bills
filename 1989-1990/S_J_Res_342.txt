Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day

one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating October 1990 as `Ending Hunger Month'.
Whereas hunger affects the lives of 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 people in
the world and takes the lives of 13,000,000 to 18,000,000 people each year,
75 percent of whom are children under the age of 5;
Whereas, while famines often gain widespread media attention and the
subsequent  response of the public, little attention is focused on the
problem of chronic hunger;
Whereas schools and communities should conduct educational programs that
lead to the development of viable methods for alleviating hunger;
Whereas there is a need to promote continuing activities that increase
education and heighten public awareness about the extent of hunger, its
causes, and consequences;
Whereas a society educated about the pervasiveness of hunger is equipped to
respond to the needs of hungry people around the world; and
Whereas the United Nations and the United States Congress have designated
October 16, 1990, as World Food Day and have called upon all people to take
appropriate actions: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 1990 is designated as `Ending
 Hunger Month', and the President of the United States is authorized and
 requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United
 States to observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
