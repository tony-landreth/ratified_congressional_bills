One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,

Joint Resolution
To designate the week beginning April 2, 1989, as `National Child Care
Awareness Week'.
Whereas the status and composition of the family in the United States is
constantly changing;
Whereas today 57 percent of all women with children younger than six years
of age work outside the home;
Whereas by 1995, two-thirds of all pre-school children and more than
three-quarters of all school-age children will have mothers in the work force;
Whereas the increasing participation of women in the work force will continue
to increase the demand for child care during the working hours;
Whereas adequate child care is an increasingly important element in enhancing
the productivity of the work force and enabling parents to receive additional
job training;
Whereas child care experts have long known that a child's first five years
are the ideal base to support lifelong learning, and child care providers
in both homes and child care centers can provide vital assistance to parents
in these critical years;
Whereas the collaboration of public and private efforts is essential to
developing accessible, high quality child care;
Whereas the National Association for the Education of Young Children is
sponsoring a week of the young child, and it is appropriate for Congress to
designate the same week as a period devoted to increasing public awareness
of child care issues;
Whereas communities across the United States are planning special activities
to honor child care providers to illustrate the importance of high quality
child care during that week; and
Whereas all children deserve high quality child care, and all parents have
a profound obligation to provide a safe wholesome environment for their
children at all times: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning April 2, 1989,
 is designated as `National Child Care Awareness Week', and the President
 of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation
 calling upon the people of the United States to observe the week with
 appropriate ceremonies and activities.
