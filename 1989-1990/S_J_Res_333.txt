One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
To designate the week of September 30, 1990, through October 6, 1990, as
`National
Job Skills Week'.
Whereas the ability to maintain an internationally competitive and productive
economy and a high standard of living depends on the development and
utilization of new technologies;
Whereas new technologies require skills that are currently unavailable in
the national workforce;
Whereas experts in both the public and private sectors predict that a
shortage of skilled entry-level workers will exist through the remainder of
the twentieth century;
Whereas young people in the United States are experiencing higher than normal
unemployment rates due to the lack of skills necessary to perform entry-level
jobs that are currently available;
Whereas young people in the United States will continue to experience higher
than normal unemployment rates unless such young people develop the skills
necessary to perform the entry-level jobs that become available;
Whereas workers in the United States, threatened by dislocation due to plant
closures and industrial relocation, need special training and education to
prepare for new jobs and new opportunities; and
Whereas a National Job Skills Week would serve to focus attention on present
and future workforce needs, to encourage public and private cooperation in
job training and educational efforts, and to highlight the technological
changes underway in the workplace: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week of September 30, 1990,
 through October 6, 1990, is designated as `National Job Skills Week', and
 the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
