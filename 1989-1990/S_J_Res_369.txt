Joint Resolution
Designating 1991 as the `Year of Thanksgiving for the Blessings of Liberty'.
Whereas the people of the United States have expressed gratitude by celebrating
a national season of thanksgiving since the 17th century;
Whereas the War for Independence was won and the constitution written and
adopted to secure the blessings of liberty for citizens;
Whereas after the first Congress drafted a Bill of Rights to be added to the
Constitution, established a Federal judicial system, created departments of
administration, and established the Government of the United States under
the Constitution, it requested President Washington to issue a proclamation
of national thanksgiving;
Whereas in the first Presidential proclamation, President Washington called
on the people of the United States to acknowledge, by thanksgiving, the
blessings of civil and religious liberty;
Whereas by December 15, 1791, three-quarters of the United States had ratified
the proposed Bill of Rights;
Whereas 1991 is recognized as the official observance of the bicentennial
of the ratification of the Bill of Rights; and
Whereas for 200 years the people of the United States have enjoyed the
blessings of liberty under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, embodied
in the first 10 amendments of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That 1991 is designated as the `Year of
 Thanksgiving for the Blessings of Liberty', and the President is authorized
 and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the Governors of the
 several States, the chief officials of local governments, and the people
 of the United States to observe the year with appropriate ceremonies and
 activities.
