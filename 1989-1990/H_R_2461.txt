 (a) ANNUAL REPORT ON OUTLAYS AND BUDGET AUTHORITY REQUIRED- (1) Not later than
 December 15, 1989, and not later than December 15 of each year thereafter,
 the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Director of
 the Congressional Budget Office shall submit to the Speaker of the House
 of Representatives and the Committees on Armed Services, Appropriations,
 and the Budget of the Senate a joint report containing an agreed resolution
 of all differences between--
 (A) the technical assumptions to be used by the Office of Management
 and Budget in preparing estimates with respect to all accounts in major
 functional category 050 (National Defense) for the budget to be submitted
 to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code,
 in the year following the year in which the report is submitted; and
 (B) the technical assumptions to be used by the Congressional Budget Office
 in preparing estimates with respect to such accounts for such budget.
 (2) In the event that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
 and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office are unable to agree
 upon any technical assumption, the report shall reflect the average of the
 relevant outlay rates or assumptions used by the Office of Management and
 Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.
 (3) The report with respect to a budget shall identify the following:
 (A) The agreed first-year and outyear outlay rates for each account for
 the Department of Defense for each fiscal year covered by the proposed budget.
 (B) The agreed amount of outlays estimated to occur from unexpended
 appropriations made for fiscal years prior to the fiscal year that begins
 after submission of the report.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BUDGET RESOLUTIONS AND BUDGET SCOREKEEPING-
 It is the sense of Congress that, in order to prevent a recurrence of a
 mismatch between budget authority and outlays for budget function 050
 (National Defense), the technical assumptions contained in the report
 under subsection (i)(1) with respect to any budget should be used in the
 preparation of that budget, the preparation of the budget resolution, and
 in all scorekeeping in connection with budget function 050 (National Defense).
 (c) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING REQUIRED REDUCTIONS AND OTHER CHANGES IN
 NATIONAL DEFENSE OUTLAYS IN RELATION TO BUDGET AUTHORITY- It is the sense
 of Congress that the outlay level specified for national defense for any
 fiscal year in the budget resolution for that fiscal year should not require
 a reduction (or other change) in outlays for national defense for that fiscal
 year below (or in relation to) the estimated outlays specified for national
 defense in the budget for such fiscal year (submitted to Congress pursuant to
 section 1105 of title 31, United States Code) by more than the amount by which
 such estimated outlays would be reduced (or otherwise changed) if the amount
 of budget authority provided for in each title of the President's request
 for budget authority for national defense (as contained in such budget)
 were reduced (or otherwise changed) by the uniform percentage necessary
 for the requested budget authority for national defense to be equal to the
 budget authority specified for national defense in that budget resolution
 unless the budget resolution is accompanied by a report that describes the
 difference between the budget authority and outlays for National Defense
 (function 050) in the President's budget and the budget resolution.

 a report in both classified and unclassified form containing the results
 of the study conducted under subsection (a). The report shall include such
 comments and recommendations as the Secretary considers appropriate and
 shall be submitted not later than March 31, 1990.
SEC. 119. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROCUREMENT OF B-2 AIRCRAFT
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States has devoted substantial resources over the past several
 decades to the strategic bomber force, including substantial resources for--
 (A) significant upgrades to B-52 aircraft;
 (B) research, development, and procurement of B-1 aircraft; and
 (C) research, development, and procurement of air-launched cruise missiles.
 (2) The current estimate of the Department of Defense of a cost of
 $70,200,000,000 for acquisition of a force of 132 B-2 aircraft is predicated
 on several assumptions, including the achievement of cost-reduction
 initiatives, not all of which have been contracted for.
 (3) The life-cycle costs for a force of 132 B-2 aircraft would be
 significantly higher than the acquisition cost estimate of $70,200,000,000.
 (4) Funds have been approved for the production of 10 B-2 aircraft through
 fiscal year 1990, but Congress has not decided the total number of such
 aircraft that should be produced.
 (5) If a substantial number of B-2 aircraft is not procured, additional
 funds could be made available for other important military programs.
 (6) Fiscal year 1990 will constitute the fifth consecutive fiscal year for
 which the amount appropriated for national defense functions of the Government
 declined (after adjusting for inflation) from the preceding fiscal year.
 (7) Expected limitations on future defense budgets make it essential that the
 Nation's defense priorities be carefully analyzed so as to properly fund the
 Armed Forces, including the various elements of the Nation's strategic forces.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is
 the sense of Congress that--
 (1) it is not prudent or possible at this time to commit to a production
 rate for the B-2 aircraft higher than the rate under the low-rate initial
 production plan;
 (2) the contingent authorization of funds in this Act for the low-rate
 initial production of two additional B-2 aircraft does not constitute a
 commitment to support the procurement of large numbers of B-2 aircraft,
 to provide funding in subsequent years for rate production of B-2 aircraft,
 or to approve a multiyear procurement of B-2 aircraft; and
 (3) before a commitment is made to proceed with initial full-rate production
 of the B-2 aircraft, the President and Congress should carefully consider
 (based upon the assumption of a START regime that uses the Reykjavik counting
 rule for bombers, upon the assumption of a START regime that uses alternative
 rules for counting bombers, and upon the assumption of no START treaty)
 the desirability and feasibility of--
 (A) structuring the strategic bomber force of the United States in such a
 manner that primary reliance would be placed upon bombers carrying cruise
 missiles rather than bombers having strictly a penetrating role; and
 (B) pursuing options for the procurement of significantly fewer than 132
 B-2 aircraft so that, if a decision is made in the future to procure an
 operational force of B-2 aircraft, the total acquisition and life-cycle
 cost of the B-2 aircraft program would be reduced.
Part C--Other Strategic Programs

BY NATO AND WARSAW PACT MEMBER NATIONS
 (a) COMMENDATION OF PRESIDENT'S CONVENTIONAL ARMS REDUCTION INITIATIVE-
 Congress commends and supports the President's conventional arms control
 initiative announced in Brussels on May 29, 1989, in which the President
 proposed, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed, that
 NATO expand its negotiating position at the negotiations on reductions in
 conventional forces in Europe (begun in Vienna on March 9, 1989, and known
 as the `CFE Talks') to include--
 (1) substantial reductions by each side to equal ceilings of helicopters
 and combat aircraft; and
 (2) a reduction to a common ceiling of United States military personnel
 stationed in Western Europe and Soviet military personnel stationed in
 Eastern Europe.
 (b) PRESIDENTIAL REPORT- (1) Not later than six months after the date
 of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress
 an unclassified report, with classified annexes as necessary, on the
 foreign policy and military implications to NATO and to the Warsaw Pact
 of significant reductions of conventional forces by NATO and Warsaw Pact
 countries to a ceiling which is the same for both sides.
 (2) The report shall address possible force reduction scenarios for a second
 round of CFE negotiations and shall be based upon two different assumptions
 with regard to the level of reductions in personnel and equipment to be
 made. Under the first assumption, personnel and equipment would be reduced
 to a level 25 percent below current NATO levels. Under the second assumption,
 personnel and equipment would be reduced to a level 50 percent below current
 NATO levels.
 (3) The report shall include the following:
 (A) A comprehensive net assessment of the current balance between NATO
 forces and Warsaw Pact forces and of the overall trends in that balance,
 including an assessment of the trends in active and reserve forces and in
 total equipment holdings in stationed and indigenous forces.
 (B) A description of the likely alternative force postures that could be
 adopted by member nations of both alliances (particularly by the United
 States and the Soviet Union) under each of the assumptions analyzed,
 together with a description of the possible effects of restructuring of
 both NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe for defensive purposes.
 (C) A statement of the costs (or savings) to the United States, over at
 least a seven-year period, estimated to be associated with each force
 posture described under subparagraph (B), together with an analysis of how
 those costs (or savings) were determined.
 (D) An analysis of the implications for NATO strategy, security, and military
 policy under each of the reduction levels referred to in paragraph (2),

 Authorization Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), is amended by striking out
 `326,414' and inserting in lieu thereof `311,855'.
 (b) EFFECTIVE DATE- The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect

SEC. 912. ACTIVE-DUTY FORCES IN EUROPE OF MEMBER NATIONS OF NATO
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), at the
 initiative of the President, have presented to the nations of the Warsaw
 Pact a comprehensive proposal concerning reductions in conventional forces
 in Europe for consideration in the negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces
 in Europe (CFE).
 (2) An agreement based on that proposal would significantly enhance security
 and stability in Europe and the cause of peace worldwide.
 (3) Irrespective of developments in the CFE negotiations, several member
 nations of NATO are considering making significant unilateral reductions over
 the next several years in the number of their active-duty forces in Europe.
 (4) Such unilateral reductions in active-duty forces before an agreement
 on CFE enters into force would--
 (A) undercut efforts by NATO to improve its conventional defense posture
 in Europe, increase reliance by NATO on the threat of the early use of
 nuclear weapons to deter aggression, and undermine the NATO arms control
 negotiating posture in the CFE negotiations; and
 (B) exacerbate longstanding burdensharing tensions among member nations
 of NATO.
 (5) Despite shifts in relative economic power from the United States to
 some of the major allies of the United States, the costs of mutual defense
 continue to be borne disproportionately by the United States.
 (6) Adjustments in burdensharing are long overdue.
 (b) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this section:
 (1) The term `active-duty forces in Europe' means those active-duty military
 personnel assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of
 NATO, except that such term does not include INF-related forces.
 (2) The term `INF-related forces' means those active-duty military personnel
 assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO who are
 to be demobilized or withdrawn from Europe as a result of the elimination
 of the intermediate-range nuclear weapons of the United States pursuant to
 the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics on the Elimination of their Intermediate-range and
 Shorter-range Missiles, signed on December 8, 1987 (commonly referred to
 as the `INF Treaty').
 (3) The term `U.S. end-strength level in Europe' means the actual number
 of active-duty forces in Europe of the Armed Forces of the United States
 at the end of a fiscal year.
 (4) The term `allied forces end-strength level in Europe' means the actual
 number of active-duty forces in Europe of the armed forces of member nations
 of NATO (other than the United States) in Europe at the end of a fiscal year.
 (c) BASELINE REPORT ON ACTIVE-DUTY FORCES IN EUROPE- (1) Not later than 60
 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense
 shall submit to the congressional defense committees, the Committee on
 Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the
 House of Representatives a report on the number of the active-duty forces in
 Europe of the member nations of NATO. The report shall identify the following:
 (1) The U.S. end-strength level in Europe for fiscal year 1989.
 (2) The allied forces end-strength level in Europe for fiscal year 1989.
 (3) The actual number of active-duty forces in Europe of the armed forces
 of each member nation of NATO (other than the United States) at the end of
 fiscal year 1989.

 hereinafter in this section referred to as the `U.S.-allied forces ratio'.
 (e) ANNUAL REPORT ON MAINTAINING ACTIVE-DUTY FORCES IN EUROPE- (1) During
 each of the fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Secretary of Defense shall
 prepare a report identifying for the preceding fiscal year the following:
 (A) The U.S. end-strength level in Europe for the fiscal year covered by
 the report.
 (B) The allied forces end-strength level in Europe for such fiscal year.
 (C) The ratio (expressed in terms of a percentage) of the U.S. end-strength
 level in Europe to the allied forces end-strength level in Europe for the
 fiscal year covered by the report.
 (2) The Secretary shall include in each such report the following:
 (A) A statement of whether there has been any change in the U.S.-allied
 forces ratio for such fiscal year compared with--
 (i) the baseline U.S.-allied forces ratio; and
 (ii) after fiscal year 1991, the U.S-allied forces ratio for the fiscal
 year immediately preceding the fiscal year covered by such report.
 (B) In the case of a change in the U.S.-allied forces ratio for such fiscal
 year, a description of the amount of such change and any explanation of
 the cause for such change.

 to section 1002(d)(2) of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985
 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note).
 (f) LIMITATION ON OBLIGATION OF FUNDS- (1) If the Secretary of Defense states
 in a report prepared under subsection (e) that the U.S.-allied forces ratio
 for the fiscal year covered by such report is greater than the baseline
 U.S.-allied forces ratio by more than one-tenth of one percentage point--
 (A) the President shall undertake appropriate diplomatic initiatives to
 persuade the member nations of NATO (other than the United States) to increase
 the number of their active-duty forces in Europe so that the U.S.-allied
 forces ratio no longer exceeds the baseline U.S.-allied forces ratio; and
 (B) funds appropriated to or for the use of the Department of Defense may
 not be obligated or expended for the next fiscal year to support active-duty
 forces in Europe of the Armed Forces of the United States at an end-strength
 level that would cause the U.S-allied forces ratio in such fiscal year to
 exceed the baseline U.S.-allied forces ratio by more than one-tenth of one
 percentage point.
 (2) The President may waive the provisions of paragraph (1) if the President
 determines that such action is critical to the national security of the
 United States. The President shall immediately notify Congress of such a
 waiver and the reasons for such waiver.
 (3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the event of a declaration of war

 end-strength level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States
 assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO at any
 level in excess of the permanent ceiling specified in section 1002(c)(1)
 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note).
SEC. 913. CONTRIBUTIONS BY JAPAN TO GLOBAL SECURITY
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress finds--

 in Japan since World War II; and
 (2) that, as a result of such changes, Japan is capable of assuming increased
 responsibility for its own security.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that, in view of the
 changes referred to in subsection (a), Japan should--
 (1) assume increased responsibility for its own security;
 (2) offset the direct costs incurred by the United States in deploying
 military forces for the defense of Japan, including costs (other than pay
 and allowances) related to the presence of United States military personnel
 in Japan; and
 (3) make a contribution to the common defense that is more commensurate
 with its economic status by taking the following actions:
 (A) Increasing expenditures for its Official Development Assistance program
 and its defense programs so that, by 1992, the level of spending by Japan
 on those programs (stated as a percentage of gross national product) will
 approximate the average of the levels of spending by the member nations
 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on official development
 assistance and defense programs (stated as a percentage of their respective
 gross national products).
 (B) Devoting any increase in its spending for such Official Development
 Assistance program primarily to the Republic of the Philippines and to
 countries in regions of importance to global stability outside of East
 Asia, particularly to countries in Latin America, the Caribbean area,
 and the Mediterranean area.
 (C) Devoting any increase in spending for that program primarily to untied
 grants and increasing the portion of total expenditures made in that program
 for those multilateral financial institutions of which Japan is a member.
 (D) Designating those nations that are to be recipients of increased
 development assistance referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) after
 consultation with Japan's security partners.
 (E) Completing, after consultation with the United States, the 5-year defense
 program of Japan for fiscal years 1986 through 1990 and, at the earliest
 possible date after the completion of that program, fulfilling the pledge
 made by the Prime Minister of Japan in May 1981 to defend the territory,
 airspace, and sea lanes of Japan to a distance of 1,000 nautical miles.
 (F) Acquiring `off-the-shelf' military equipment from the United States
 (including completely equipped, long-range early warning aircraft, additional
 AEGIS weapon systems, refueling aircraft, munitions, and spare parts) in
 developing the capabilities called for in Japan's current and subsequent
 5-year defense programs.
 (c) NEGOTIATIONS AND CONSULTATIONS- At the earliest practicable date after
 the enactment of this Act, the President shall--
 (1) enter into negotiations with Japan for the purpose of achieving an
 agreement under which Japan agrees to make contributions sufficient in
 value to meet the direct cost of deploying United States forces for the
 defense of Japan; and
 (2) issue an invitation to the Government of Japan and other governments
 of Pacific allies of the United States to engage in annual multilateral
 consultations on security concerns, consistent with the constitutions and
 national defense requirements of the respective countries.

 is appropriate, not later than April 1, 1990, the President shall submit to
 the congressional committees described in paragraph (3) an initial report
 on the status and results of--
 (A) the negotiations with Japan referred to in subsection (c)(1); and
 (B) the invitation required under subsection (c)(2), including any
 consultations resulting from such invitation.

 Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives on
 practicable options available to the Department of Defense to reduce costs
 associated with maintaining overseas--
 (1) dependents of members of the Armed Forces; and
 (2) dependents of civilian employees of the Department of Defense.
 (b) ELEMENTS OF REPORT- In preparing the report required by subsection (a),
 the Secretary shall specifically address, at a minimum, the following:
 (1) Whether expansion of incentives for unaccompanied tours of duty overseas
 would be effective in increasing the number of such tours and whether such
 an expansion of incentives would be cost effective.
 (2) Whether more frequent rotation of overseas personnel without dependents
 would result in overall savings as compared to current rotation practices.
 (3) Whether an increase in the use of local contractors at overseas
 stations to provide services currently being provided by Department of
 Defense personnel would result in overall savings to the United States.
 (4) The cost implications for United States families at overseas stations
 resulting from an increase in the use of local contractors.
 (5) Whether costs associated with the support of overseas dependents would
 change from a reduction in personnel under a conventional forces in Europe
 (CFE) agreement.

 stations could be made without materially affecting the standard of living
 of the personnel assigned to duty at such stations.

 in increased costs in programs in the United States.
 (10) The extent to which dependents would be likely to accompany members
 of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the Department of Defense to
 overseas stations in the absence of each of the various types of special
 assistance and benefits currently provided to overseas dependents.

 be taken to relieve the United States from the burdens of its military
 presence in Europe.
 (2) Such nations should consider the provision of base facilities for
 allied forces and equipment as a part of their national contributions to
 Western security.
 (3) Such nations should not expect compensation for providing facilities that
 the NATO alliance decides are essential to implement NATO security strategy.

 Congress a comprehensive report on the Trident program under a possible
 Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) agreement. The report shall address
 the following issues:
 (1) The objective for the size of the Trident submarine force fleet both
 with and without a START agreement.
 (2) The implications for United States strategic force posture under a START
 agreement of a fleet of 21 or more Trident submarines, each with 192 warheads
 on 24 ballistic missiles, under two different assumptions, as follows:
 (A) All such warheads are accountable under START limits.
 (B) The warheads on one-to-three Trident submarines are not accountable
 under START limits.
 (3) A net assessment of the implications for United States security of a
 START agreement that allows the Soviet Union as well as the United States to
 have an equivalent number of warheads on submarines that are not accountable
 under START limits.
 (4) The technical feasibility and cost implications of various options
 for reducing the number of warheads on Trident submarines, including those
 submarines already built, those under construction, and those yet to be built.
 (5) The verification challenges to the United States posed by such options if
 the Soviet Union were to adopt them in its ballistic missile submarine forces.
 (b) FORM OF REPORT- The President shall submit the report under subsection
 (a) in both classified and unclassified versions.
 (c) WAIVER- The President may waive the requirements of subsection (a) if
 he has signed a START agreement or other strategic arms reduction agreement
 with the Soviet Union before the date by which the report is otherwise
 required to be submitted.
SEC. 1002. PRESIDENTIAL REPORT ON THE VERIFICATION WORK THAT HAS BEEN
CONDUCTED WITH REGARD TO MOBILE ICBMs UNDER A START AGREEMENT
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States must have confidence that any agreement achieved
 through the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (START) in Geneva will be
 effectively verifiable.
 (2) The position of the United States at the START negotiations, from 1985
 until September 1989, was to ban the deployment of mobile intercontinental
 ballistic missiles (ICBMs) under a START regime unless an effective
 verification regime could be identified and implemented. In September 1989,
 the United States announced that it was withdrawing its proposal for the
 ban of mobile ICBMs, contingent upon Congress providing funds for mobile
 ICBMs to be deployed by the United States.
 (3) The Soviet Union has deployed two mobile ICBM systems, the SS-24 and
 the SS-25.
 (4) The President conducted a strategic review during the period between
 January 20, 1989, and the resumption of the START negotiations on June
 15, 1989.
 (b) PRESIDENTIAL REPORT- Not later than March 31, 1990, the President shall
 submit to Congress a report (in classified and unclassified form) describing
 all studies that have been performed between March 1985 and August 1989
 by agencies of the United States Government with regard to the capability
 of the United States to monitor and verify a START agreement which allows
 mobile ICBMs. The report shall include the following:
 (1) A description of each study conducted by United States Government
 agencies during the strategic review referred to in subsection (a)(4) to
 determine the ability of the United States to verify limitations on mobile
 ICBMs of the Soviet Union under a START agreement, including a summary of
 the conclusions reached under each such study.
 (2) A description of any so-called `Red Team' study conducted between March
 1985 and August 1989 with regard to the existence of mobile ICBMs under
 a START regime, including a summary of the conclusions reached under each
 such study.
 (3) A description of each study conducted by United States Government agencies
 between March 1989 and August 1989 to assess the value of various options
 relating to the verification of mobile ICBMs (such options to include the
 option known as `tagging' and the establishment of designated deployment
 areas), including a summary of the conclusions reached under each such study.
SEC. 1003. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON START TALKS
 Congress hereby reaffirms the sense of Congress expressed in the second
 session of the 100th Congress (in section 902 of the National Defense
 Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 102 Stat. 2031))
 that any agreement negotiated by the President to achieve a reduction and
 limitation on strategic arms (through the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
 in Geneva or otherwise)--
 (1) should not prevent the United States from deploying a force structure
 under the agreement which emphasizes survivable strategic systems and,
 in particular, should not in any way compromise the security of the United
 States ballistic-missile carrying submarine force; and
 (2) should not prohibit or limit the deployment of non-nuclear cruise
 missiles.
SEC. 1004. REPORT ON ASYMMETRIES IN CAPABILITIES OF UNITED STATES AND SOVIET
UNION TO PRODUCE AND DEPLOY BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS
 (a) STUDY REQUIRED- The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study on the

 Union to deploy ballistic missile defenses beyond those permitted under
 the 1972 ABM Treaty. The study shall be conducted in coordination with the
 Director of Central Intelligence.
 (b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED IN STUDY- Subject to subsection (e), the study
 shall include the following:
 (1) An assessment of the likelihood of a breakout by the Soviet Union from
 the 1972 ABM Treaty in the next five years and the assumptions used for
 that assessment.
 (2) An assessment of the capability of the Soviet Union to exploit a situation
 in which the limitations of the 1972 ABM Treaty do not apply, including a
 detailed assessment of the capabilities of the Soviet Union to produce--
 (A) space-based anti-ballistic missile (ABM) launchers and interceptors;
 (B) ground-based ABM launchers and interceptors; and
 (C) the infrastructure for ABM battle management command, control, and

 (c) STUDY TO ASSESS POSSIBLE UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO SOVIET BREAKOUT- (1)
 The study shall also include an assessment of the immediate and long-term
 actions that could be taken by the United States to respond to redress any
 asymmetry in the potential of the United States and the Soviet Union to
 exploit a breakout by the Soviet Union from the 1972 ABM Treaty.
 (2) That assessment shall include an evaluation of the actions that would
 be necessary to support--
 (A) a one-site ABM system (as allowed under the Treaty); or
 (B) an expanded ABM system unconstrained by the limitations of the 1972
 ABM Treaty.
 (3) Such assessment shall specifically address the required actions, and the
 costs associated with those actions, to support both the one-site ABM system
 and the expanded ABM system to be evaluated under paragraph (2), including

 1991 is submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United
 States Code, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report
 on the study under subsection (a). The report shall be submitted in both
 classified and unclassified form. The report shall specify the results
 of the study under subsection (a), including each matter required to be
 included in the study under this section.
 (e) WAIVER OF REQUIRED STUDY FEATURE- The study under subsection (a) need not
 include the assessment referred to in subsection (b)(1) if, before the date
 of the submission of the report required by subsection (d) with respect to
 the study, the President submits to Congress the report required by section
 907 of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law
 100-456; 102 Stat. 2034), regarding antiballistic missile capabilities and

 ABM Treaty' means the Treaty Between the United States of America and the
 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitations of Anti-Ballistic
 Missiles, signed at Moscow on May 26, 1972.
SEC. 1005. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ACCIDENTAL LAUNCH PROTECTION
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) has made substantial progress
 in developing technologies to defend the United States from a possible
 ballistic missile attack, be it deliberate or accidental.
 (2) Ground-based elements and their associated adjuncts and technologies
 represent the most mature technologies within the SDI program and should
 therefore receive priority by the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.
 (3) The United States is a signatory to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
 Treaty.
 (4) There have been several accidents involving ballistic missiles,
 including the loss of a submarine of the Soviet Union due to inadvertent
 missile ignition and the inadvertent landing in China of a test missile of
 the Soviet Union.
 (5) The continued proliferation of offensive ballistic missile forces by
 non-superpower countries hostile to the United States and our allies raises
 the possibility of future nuclear threats.
 (b) REAFFIRMATION OF SENSE OF CONGRESS- Congress hereby reaffirms the sense
 of Congress expressed in section 224(b) of the National Defense Authorization
 Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 102 Stat. 1942) stating--
 (1) that the Secretary of Defense should direct the Strategic Defense
 Initiative Organization to give priority to development of technologies
 and systems for a system capable of protecting the United States from the
 accidental launch of a strategic ballistic missile against the continental
 United States; and
 (2) that such development of an accidental launch protection system should be
 carried out with an objective of ensuring that such system is in compliance
 with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
 (c) SUBMISSION OF PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED REPORT- The Secretary of Defense
 shall submit to Congress forthwith the report on the status of planning for
 development of a deployment option for such an accidental launch protection
 system that was required by section 224(c) of that Act to be submitted not
 later than March 1, 1989.
SEC. 1006. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE
KRASNOYARSK RADAR
 (a) REAFFIRMATION OF PRIOR FINDINGS- Congress hereby reaffirms the findings
 made with respect to the large phased-array radar of the Soviet Union known
 as the `Krasnoyarsk radar' in paragraphs (1) through (6) of section 902(a)
 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989
 (Public Law 100-180; 101 Stat. 1135), as follows:
 (1) The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits each party from
 deploying ballistic missile early warning radars except at locations along
 the periphery of its national territory and oriented outward.
 (2) The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibits each party from deploying
 an ABM system to defend its national territory and from providing a base
 for any such nationwide defense.
 (3) Large phased-array radars were recognized during negotiation of the
 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as the critical long lead-time element of a
 nationwide defense against ballistic missiles.
 (4) In 1983 the United States discovered the construction, in the interior
 of the Soviet Union near the town of Krasnoyarsk, of a large phased-array
 radar that has subsequently been judged to be for ballistic early warning
 and tracking.
 (5) The Krasnoyarsk radar is more than 700 kilometers from the
 Soviet-Mongolian border and is not directed outward but instead faces the
 northeast Soviet border more than 4,500 kilometers away.
 (6) The Krasnoyarsk radar is identical to other Soviet ballistic missile early
 warning radars and is ideally situated to fill the gap that would otherwise
 exist in a nationwide Soviet ballistic missile early warning radar network.
 (b) FURTHER FINDINGS- In addition to the findings referred to in subsection
 (a), Congress finds with respect to the Krasnoyarsk radar that--
 (1) in 1987 the President declared that radar to be a clear violation of
 the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty;
 (2) until the meeting between the Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister
 of the Soviet Union at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in September 1989, the Soviet
 Union had rejected demands by the United States that it dismantle that radar
 without conditions, but the joint statment issued following that meeting
 states that the government of the Soviet Union `had decided to completely
 dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar station'; and
 (3) on October 23, 1989, the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union conceded
 that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
 Missile Treaty.
 (c) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress--
 (1) that the Soviet Union should dismantle the Krasnoyarsk radar (as announced
 in the joint statement referred to in subsection (b)(2)) expeditiously and
 without conditions; and
 (2) that until such radar is completely dismantled it will remain a clear
 violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
SEC. 1007. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY OF TREATY
LIMITATIONS ON WEAPONS CAPABLE OF THREATENING MILITARY SATELLITES
 It is the sense of Congress that, as soon as practicable, the President
 should explore the feasibility of a mutual and verifiable treaty with the
 Soviet Union which places the strictest possible limitations, consistent
 with the security interests of the United States and its allies, on the
 development, testing, production, and deployment of weapons capable of
 directly threatening United States military satellites.
SEC. 1008. REPORT ON SATELLITE SURVIVABILITY
 (a) REQUIREMENT FOR REPORT- The President shall submit to Congress a
 comprehensive report on United States antisatellite weapon activities and
 the survivability of United States satellites against current and potential
 antisatellite weapons deployed by the Soviet Union. The report shall be
 submitted by March 15, 1990, and shall be submitted in both classified and
 unclassified versions.
 (b) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT- The report required by subsection
 (a) shall include the following:
 (1) Detailed information (including funding profiles, expected capabilities,
 and schedules for development, testing, and deployment) on all United States
 antisatellite weapon programs.
 (2) An analysis of the antisatellite potential of the anticipated deployed
 version of each Strategic Defense Initiative technology capable of damaging
 or destroying objects in space.
 (3) An assessment of the threat that would be posed to satellites of the
 United States if the technologies described in paragraphs (1) and (2) were
 to be tested by the Soviet Union, at levels of performance equal to those
 intended by the United States, and developed into weapons for damaging or
 destroying objects in space.
 (4) A review of arms control options and satellite survivability measures
 (including cost data) that would improve the survivability of current and
 future United States military satellite systems.
 (5) A review of alternative means of providing the support to military
 forces of the United States that is currently provided by United States
 satellites if those satellites become vulnerable to attack as the result
 of the deployment by the Soviet Union of antisatellite weapons with the
 levels of performance contemplated in paragraph (3).
SEC. 1009. REPORT ON THE DESIRABILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION
REGARDING LIMITATIONS ON ANTISATELLITE CAPABILITIES
 (a) REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT- The President shall submit to Congress
 a comprehensive report regarding the desirability of an agreement with
 the Soviet Union to impose limitations on antisatellite capabilities. The
 President shall include in such report his determination of whether a ban or
 other limitations on some or all antisatellite weapons would be verifiable
 and, if so, whether such a ban or other limitation would be in the national
 interest of the United States.
 (b) MATTERS RELATING TO VERIFICATION- In making the determination referred
 to in subsection (a), the President shall--
 (1) consider the extent to which on-site inspection measures (as well as
 national technical means for verification) can increase confidence in the
 ability of the United States to monitor and verify various agreed-upon
 antisatellite limitations; and
 (2) examine various arms control possibilities, including--
 (A) a total ban on antisatellite capability by both the United States and
 the Soviet Union;
 (B) a ban or other limitation on antisatellite weapons with the potential
 to attack satellites at altitudes above the Van Allen belt; and
 (C) a ban or other limitation on antisatellite weapons that operate only
 in low-Earth orbit.
 (c) MATTERS RELATING TO DETERRENCE AND WAR FIGHTING REQUIREMENTS- In the
 report required by subsection (a), the President shall also address the
 following:
 (1) The contribution an antisatellite capability of the United States can
 make toward enhancing deterrence.
 (2) The contribution an antisatellite capability can make toward meeting
 the war fighting requirements of the United States and how such a capability
 enhances force survivability.
 (3) The extent to which (based upon a net assessment) the United States
 would be better able to meet its war fighting requirements and deterrence
 objectives if--
 (A) the Soviet Union possessed an antisatellite capability and the United
 States did not possess an antisatellite capability;
 (B) neither the United States nor the Soviet Union possessed an antisatellite
 capability;
 (C) the United States and the Soviet Union both possessed a limited
 antisatellite capability;
 (D) the United States and the Soviet Union both possessed an unrestricted
 antisatellite capability.
 (d) SUBMISSION OF REPORT- The report required by subsection (a) shall be
 submitted to Congress not later than May 1, 1990, and shall be submitted
 in both classified and unclassified versions.
SEC. 1010. REPORT ON VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT
NUCLEAR TESTING
 (a) REPORT REQUIREMENT- The Secretary of Energy shall prepare a report,
 in classified form, assessing the possible effects on the abilities of the
 United States to verify compliance by the Soviet Union with any agreement
 (presently in effect or under negotiation) to limit testing of nuclear
 devices should any information or data now obtained under any cooperative
 agreement with any controlled country and used to verify the degree of
 such compliance be curtailed or become unavailable due to a change in, or
 severing of, diplomatic relations with such a controlled country. The report
 shall assess, in particular, whether compliance by the Soviet Union with any
 such agreement to limit testing of nuclear devices can be fully and reliably
 verified should such a cooperative agreement be curtailed or terminated. The
 report shall be prepared in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.
 (b) SUBMISSION OF REPORT- The report prepared under subsection (a) shall
 be submitted to Congress not later than six months after the date of the
 enactment of this Act.
 (c) CONTROLLED COUNTRY DEFINITION- For purposes of this section, the term
 `controlled country' means a country listed in section 620(f)(1) of the
 Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2370(f)(1)).
SEC. 1011. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS AND UNITED STATES
MODERNIZATION POLICY
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The United States is currently engaged in a wide range of arms control
 negotiations in the areas of strategic nuclear forces, strategic defenses,
 conventional force levels, chemical weapons, and security and confidence
 building measures.
 (2) On May 30, 1989, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization issued a
 `Comprehensive Concept on Arms Control and Disarmament' which placed a
 special emphasis on arms control as a means of enhancing security and
 stability in Europe.
 (3) The President has stated that arms control is one of the highest
 priorities of the United States in the area of security and foreign policy
 and that the United States will pursue a dynamic, active arms control
 dialogue with the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact countries.
 (4) The United States has already made major proposals at the Conventional
 Forces in Europe Talks, convened on March 6, 1989, which would result in
 a dramatic reduction in Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
 (5) The President, on September 25, 1989, made a major new arms control
 proposal in the area of chemical weapons.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) the President is to be commended for pursuing a wide array of arms control
 initiatives in the context of a multitude of arms control negotiations,
 all of which have been designed to enhance global security and result in
 meaningful, militarily significant reductions in military forces;
 (2) Congress fully supports the arms control efforts of the President and
 encourages the government of the Soviet Union to respond favorably to United
 States arms control proposals which would require the Soviet Union to reduce
 its massive quantitative superiority in military weaponry;
 (3) the President should seek arms control agreements that would not limit
 the United States to levels of forces inferior to the limits provided for
 the Soviet Union; and
 (4) the President's efforts to negotiate such agreements is dependent upon
 the maintenance of a vigorous research and development and modernization
 program as required for a prudent defense posture.
 (c) REAFFIRMATION OF PROHIBITION RELATING TO ENTERING INTO CERTAIN
 ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS- Congress hereby reaffirms the proviso in the
 first sentence of section 33 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act
 (22 U.S.C. 2573) that no action may be taken under that Act or any other
 Act that will obligate the United States to disarm or to reduce or limit
 the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States, except pursuant to
 the treatymaking power of the President under the Constitution or unless
 authorized by further affirmative legislation by the Congress.
SEC. 1012. REPORT ON EFFECT OF SPACE NUCLEAR REACTORS ON GAMMA-RAY ASTRONOMY
MISSIONS
 Not later than April 30, 1990, the President shall submit to Congress a report
 on the potential for interference with gamma-ray astronomy missions that
 could be caused by the placement in Earth orbit of space nuclear reactors.
SEC. 1013. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS NEGOTIATIONS
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The proliferation of chemical weapons and the repeated use of chemical
 weapons represent a grave threat to the security and interests of the
 United States.
 (2) The most comprehensive and effective response to the threat posed by
 the proliferation of chemical weapons is the completion of an effectively
 verifiable treaty banning the production and stockpiling of all chemical
 weapons.
 (3) The successful completion of a treaty banning all chemical weapons
 through the negotiations at the multinational United Nations Conference on
 Disarmament in Geneva should be one of the highest arms control priorities
 of the United States.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is
 the sense of Congress that--
 (1) the President should continue ongoing efforts to establish an agreement
 with the Soviet Union and other countries establishing a mutual and
 effectively verifiable agreement to stop the production, proliferation,
 and stockpiling of all lethal chemical weapons; and
 (2) the United States negotiators in Geneva should take concrete steps to
 initiate proposals regarding the composition of the verification regime for
 such an agreeement that will meet the legitimate concerns of other parties
 while addressing the security concerns of the United States.
SEC. 1014. UNITED STATES PROGRAM FOR ON-SITE INSPECTIONS UNDER ARMS CONTROL
AGREEMENTS
 (a) FINDINGS CONCERNING ON-SITE INSPECTION PERSONNEL- Congress makes the
 following findings:
 (1) The United States is currently engaged in multilateral and bilateral
 negotiations seeking to achieve treaties or agreements to reduce or eliminate
 various types of military weapons and to make certain reductions in military
 personnel levels. These negotiations include negotiations for (A) reductions
 in strategic forces, conventional armaments, and military personnel levels,
 (B) regimes for monitoring nuclear testing, and (C) the complete elimination
 of chemical weapons.
 (2) Requirements for monitoring these possible treaties or agreements will
 be extensive and will place severe stress on the monitoring capabilities
 of United States national technical means.
 (3) In the case of the INF Treaty, the United States and the Soviet
 Union negotiated, and are currently using, on-site inspection procedures
 to complement and support monitoring by national technical means. Similar
 on-site inspection procedures are being negotiated for inclusion in possible
 future treaties and agreements referred to in paragraph (1).
 (4) During initial implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty, the
 United States was not fully prepared for the personnel requirements for
 the conduct of on-site inspections. The Director of Central Intelligence
 has stated that on-site inspection requirements for any strategic arms
 reduction treaty or agreement will be far more extensive than those for
 the INF Treaty. The number of locations within the Soviet Union that would
 possibly be subject to on-site inspections under a START agreement have
 been estimated to be approximately 2,500 (compared to 120 for the INF Treaty).
 (5) On-site inspection procedures are likely to be an integral part of any
 future arms control treaty or agreement.
 (6) Personnel requirements will be extensive for such on-site inspection
 procedures, both in terms of numbers of personnel and technical and linguistic
 skills. Since verification requirements for the INF Treaty are already
 placing severe stress on current personnel resources, the requirements for
 verification under START and other possible future treaties and agreements
 may quickly exceed the current number of verification personnel having
 necessary technical and language skills.
 (7) There is a clear need for a database of the names of individuals who
 are members of the Armed Forces or civilian employees of the United States
 Government, or of other citizens and nationals of the United States, who
 are qualified (by reason of technical or language skills) to participate
 in on-site inspections under an arms control treaty or agreement.
 (8) The organization best suited to establish such a database is the On-Site
 Inspection Agency (OSIA) of the Department of Defense, which was created by
 the President to implement (for the United States) the on-site inspection
 provisions of the INF Treaty.
 (b) STATUS OF THE OSIA- (1) Congress finds that--
 (A) the Director of the OSIA (currently a brigadier general of the Army) is
 appointed by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary
 of State and the approval of the President;
 (B) the Secretary of Defense provides to the Director appropriate policy
 guidance formulated by the interagency arms control mechanism established
 by the President;
 (C) most of the personnel of the OSIA are members of the Armed Forces (who are
 trained and paid by the military departments within the Department of Defense)
 and include linguists, weapons specialists, and foreign area specialists;
 (D) the Department of Defense provides the OSIA with substantially all of its
 administrative and logistic support (including military air transportation
 for inspections in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe); and
 (E) the facilities in Europe and the United States at which OSIA personnel
 escort personnel of the Soviet Union conducting inspections under the
 on-site inspection terms of the INF Treaty are under the jurisdiction of
 the Department of Defense (or under the jurisdiction of entities that are
 contractors with the Department of Defense).
 (2) In light of the findings in paragraph (1) and the report submitted
 pursuant to section 909 of Public Law 100-456 entitled `Report to the Congress
 on U.S. Monitoring and Verification Activities Related to the INF Treaty'
 (submitted on July 27, 1989), Congress hereby determines that by locating
 the On-Site Inspection Agency within the Department of Defense for the
 purposes of administrative and logistic support and operational guidance,
 and integrating on-site inspection responsibilities under the INF Treaty with
 existing organizational activities of that Department, the President has
 been able to ensure that sensitive national security assets are protected
 and that obligations of the United States under that treaty are fulfilled
 in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
 (c) ESTABLISHMENT OF PERSONNEL DATABASE- (1) In light of the findings
 in subsection (a), the Director of the On-Site Inspection Agency shall
 establish a database consisting of the names of individuals who could be
 assigned or detailed (in the case of Government personnel) or employed
 (in the case of non-Government personnel) to participate in the conduct of
 on-site inspections under any future arms control treaty or agreement that
 includes provisions for such inspections.
 (2) The database should be composed of the names of individuals with skills
 (including linguistic and technical skills) necessary for the conduct of
 on-site inspections.
 (d) INF TREATY DEFINED- For purposes of this section, the term `INF Treaty'
 means the Treaty Between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range
 Missiles, signed in Washington, DC, on December 8, 1987.
TITLE XI--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT MATTERS
Part A--Force Structure
SEC. 1101. STUDY OF TOTAL FORCE POLICY, FORCE MIX, AND MILITARY FORCE STRUCTURE
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) Since the inception of the Total Force Policy in the Department of
 Defense in 1973, there has never been a comprehensive, authoritative study
 done by the Department on the operation and effectiveness of that policy.
 (2) Decisions within the Department of Defense with respect to military
 force mix appear to be made in a fragmented and decentralized manner.
 (3) A comprehensive study of the Total Force Policy, force mix, and military
 force structure is long overdue.
 (b) STUDY- (1) The Secretary of Defense shall convene a study group to review
 the operation, effectiveness, and soundness of the following policies and
 practices of the Department of Defense and to make recommendations to the
 Secretary for improvement of those policies and practices:
 (A) The Total Force Policy.
 (B) Assignment of missions within and between the active and reserve
 components of the armed forces.
 (C) Force structure of the active and reserve components of the armed forces.
 (2) The study group shall include--
 (A) senior-level active-duty officers from each branch of the armed forces;
 (B) senior-level reserve-component officers from each of the seven reserve
 components;
 (C) civilian officials of the Department of Defense; and
 (D) such participants from outside the Department of Defense as the Secretary
 considers appropriate.
 (3) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall provide such joint
 staff support to the study group as necessary. He shall participate in the
 activities of the study group in accordance with the provisions of section
 153 of title 10, United States Code, including the responsibility to assess
 the conformance of manpower programs and policies with strategic plans and
 to advise the study group about the extent to which program recommendations
 and budget proposals conform with the priorities established in strategic
 plans and for the combatant commands.
 (4) The Secretary shall ensure that the study group, in carrying out its
 duties and responsibilities, has access to federally funded research centers
 (FFRCs) and other necessary support.
 (5) The Secretary of Defense shall consult with the Secretary of
 Transportation with respect to the functions of the study group insofar as
 they relate to the Selected Reserve of the Coast Guard Reserve.
 (6) Meetings of the study group may be closed to the public in connection
 with the consideration of classified material.
 (c) MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED- (1) In carrying out the study required by
 subsection (a), the study group shall evaluate and make recommendations
 to the Secretary concerning each of the following matters (with each such
 matter to be evaluated separately insofar as it relates to each policy or
 practice set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of subsection (b)(1)):
 (1) With respect to the Total Force Policy of the Department of Defense,
 the basic tenets of that policy, how well that policy has been implemented,
 and what changes (if any) are desirable to improve upon that policy and
 its implementation.
 (2) The effectiveness of the existing chain of management and command
 responsibility in evaluating and integrating force requirements among the
 armed forces, and between the active components and the reserve components.
 (3) The extent to which officials responsible for such evaluation and
 integration of force requirements currently (and should in the future)
 participate in the budget and resource allocation processes of the Department
 of Defense.
 (4) The adequacy of the methodology used by the Department of Defense in
 the assignment of missions between the active and reserve components and,
 within each active and reserve component, the assignment of missions among
 various major types of units, including--
 (A) the extent to which that methodology includes the use of cost-benefit
 analyses; and
 (B) the methodology for the manner by which force reductions are distributed
 within individual units and between active and reserve components.
 (5) The scope and size of force reductions with respect to major units
 (such as air wings, carrier groups, and divisions) that would result in an
 irreversible change of the capability of those units to perform assigned
 missions, with emphasis on considerations such as mobilization, loss of
 skilled manpower, equipment, and training.
 (d) ADDITIONAL MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED- (1) In carrying out its study and
 making its recommendations, the study group shall also evaluate the process
 by which decisions within the Department of Defense respecting force mix
 and force structure are made with regard to the readiness, sustainability,
 and overall mission capability of the active and reserve forces. The study
 group shall also consider whether the Department of Defense has a cogent
 strategy for making such decisions with respect to force mix that anticipates
 a substantially smaller military force structure in the future and whether
 the Department has developed a system for regular and systematic top-level
 evaluation of decisions respecting force mix or reductions in force structure.
 (2) In carrying out the evaluation required by paragraph (1), the study group
 shall consider (among other matters it considers appropriate) the following:
 (A) The optimal structure of military forces required to meet the threat as
 described in net assessments prepared pursuant to section 153 of title 10,
 United States Code, taking into account currently available and projected
 budget resources.
 (B) The appropriateness of the missions that have been assigned to major
 units (such as air wings, carrier groups, and divisions) in each of the
 active and reserve components in view of the status of those units with
 respect to personnel and equipment resources and training systems.
 (C) The response times for the deployment of such units in the event of
 a mobilization.
 (D) An evaluation of the readiness and sustainability of each of the active
 and reserve components and of the contributions of each such component to
 the overall military capability of the United States.
 (E) The extent to which the active and reserve component units that are
 identified for use during the first 30 days of a mobilization are prepared
 to undertake wartime missions (as measured against the standards established
 by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in accordance with section 153
 of title 10, United States Code), the reasons for any lack of preparedness
 for such missions, and recommendations for measures that would be necessary
 for those units to become fully mission capable.
 (F) The adequacy of equipment distribution and modernization in the active
 and reserve components, including consideration of the importance of
 prepositioning of light and heavy equipment in the mobilization process.
 (G) The adequacy of the current base of military personnel and equipment
 available for short notice rotation and deployment in order to meet worldwide
 defense commitments.
 (H) The capability of each component of the active and reserve forces
 to meet assigned and projected missions at each step in the mobilization
 process and the adequacy of current airlift and sealift capability.
 (I) The resources (including funds) needed for sufficient personnel,
 equipment, and training to achieve desired force structure and mission
 capability in both the active and reserve components.
 (J) The capability of the active and reserve components, jointly and
 separately, to respond to mobilization requirements at each stage of the
 mobilization process.
 (d) REPORTS- (1) The study group shall submit to the Secretary of Defense
 an interim report on its findings and recommendations at such time as the
 Secretary may require, but not later than September 1, 1990. The Secretary
 shall submit the interim report to the Committees on Armed Services of the
 Senate and the House of Representatives not later than September 15, 1990.
 (2) The study group shall submit its final report, including its findings
 and recommendations, to the Secretary not later than December 1, 1990. The
 Secretary shall submit the final report of the study group, together with
 any comment and recommendation of the Secretary, to those committees not
 later than December 31, 1990.

 `(4) For purposes of this chapter, a school that is organized within,
 and operated by, a military department may not be construed to be a joint

SEC. 1123. PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION IN JOINT MATTERS
 (a) EXISTING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PROFESSIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION- (1)
 The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986
 (Public Law 99-433; 100 Stat. 992) mandated--
 (A) the strengthening of the focus on joint matters in courses of instruction
 offered by professional military education schools operated by the military
 departments; and
 (B) the maintenance of rigorous standards at joint professional military
 education schools for the education of joint specialty officers.
 (2) Congress applauds the actions taken since 1986 by the Secretary of
 Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, consistent with such
 mandate, to improve professional military education provided by intermediate
 and senior professional military education schools.
 (b) STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL POLICY- As part of the efforts of the Secretary
 of Defense to improve professional military education, Congress urges, as a
 matter of policy, and fully expects the Secretary to establish the following:
 (1) A coherent and comprehensive framework for the education of officers,
 including officers nominated for the joint specialty.
 (2) A two-phase approach to strengthening the focus on joint matters,
 as follows:
 (A) Phase I instruction consisting of a joint curriculum, in addition to the
 principal curriculum taught to all officers at service-operated professional
 military education schools.
 (B) Phase II instruction consisting of a follow-on, solely joint curriculum
 taught at the Armed Forces Staff College to officers who are expected
 to be selected for the joint specialty. The curriculum should emphasize
 multiple `hands on' exercises and must adequately prepare students to
 perform effectively from the outset in what will probably be their first
 exposure to a totally new environment, an assignment to a joint, multiservice
 organization. Phase II instruction should be structured so that students
 progress from a basic knowledge of joint matters learned in Phase I to the
 level of expertise necessary for successful performance in the joint arena.
 (3) A sequenced approach to joint education in which the norm would require
 an officer to complete Phase I instruction before proceeding to Phase II
 instruction. An exception to the normal sequence should be granted by the
 Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff only on a case-by-case basis for
 compelling cause. Officers selected to receive such an exception should
 be required to demonstrate a basic knowledge of joint matters and other
 aspects of the Phase I curriculum that qualifies them to meet the minimum
 requirements established for entry into Phase II instruction without first
 completing Phase I instruction. The number of officers selected to attend an
 offering of the principal course of instruction at the Armed Forces Staff
 College who have not completed Phase I instruction should comprise only a
 small portion of the total number of officers selected.
 (c) DURATION OF PRINCIPAL COURSE OF INSTRUCTION AT THE ARMED FORCES STAFF
 COLLEGE- (1) Section 663 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by
 adding at the end the following new subsection:

 COLLEGE- The duration of the principal course of instruction offered at
 the Armed Forces Staff College may not be less than three months.'.
 (2) Subsection (e) of such section, as added by paragraph (1), shall be

 date of the enactment of this Act.

 (1) by redesignating paragraph (17) as paragraph (18); and
 (2) by inserting after paragraph (16) the following new paragraph:
 `(17) With regard to each time the principal course of instruction at the
 Armed Forces Staff College is offered--
 `(A) the number of officers selected to attend that course who did not first
 complete while in residence at a professional military education school
 operated by a military department the principal course of instruction
 offered at that school;
 `(B) the number of those officers as a percentage of all officers who
 attended that course of instruction at the Armed Forces Staff College;
 `(C) a description of the different reasons why officers were selected
 to attend that course without first attending the principal course of
 instruction offered at a professional military education school operated
 by a military department; and
 `(D) the number of officers so selected for each such reason.'.
 (e) JOINT MATTERS DEFINED- For purposes of this section, the term `joint

 term of service for which he was appointed as a judge of the United States
 Court of Military Appeals is eligible for an annuity under this section
 upon separation from civilian service in the Federal Government.
 `(2) A person who is eligible for an annuity under this section shall be paid
 that annuity if, at the time he becomes eligible to receive that annuity,
 he elects to receive that annuity in lieu of any other annuity for which
 he may be eligible at the time of such election (whether an immediate or
 a deferred annuity) under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of
 chapter 84 of title 5 or any other retirement system for civilian employees
 of the Federal Government. Such an election may not be revoked.

 that are similar to those provided under survivor and former spouse annuity
 programs under other retirement systems for civilian employees of the
 Federal Government. The program may include provisions for the reduction
 in the annuity paid the person as a condition for the survivor annuity. An
 election by a judge (including a senior judge) or former judge to receive an
 annuity under this section terminates any right or interest which any other
 individual may have to a survivor annuity under any other retirement system

 that judge or former judge as a civilian officer or employee of the Federal
 Government (except with respect to an election under subsection (g)(1)(B)).

 section by reason of service as a judge of the court and who is appointed

 an annuity under this section by reason of service as a judge of the court
 and who later is appointed as a justice or judge of the United States to

 under this section, or (B) the annuity or salary to which he is entitled
 by reason of his service as such a justice or judge of the United States,
 as determined by an election by that person at the time of his retirement
 from the office, or from regular active service in the office, of justice
 or judge of the United States. Such an election may not be revoked.

 paragraph (1)(B) terminates (A) any election previously made by such person
 to provide a survivor annuity pursuant to subsection (d), and (B) any right
 of any other individual to receive a survivor annuity pursuant to subsection
 (d) on the basis of the service of that person.

SEC. 1638. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING KIDNAPPING
AND MURDER OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL HIGGINS
 (a) FINDINGS- Congress makes the following findings:
 (1) The radical, Lebanese-based terrorist organization which calls itself
 the `Organization of the Oppressed of the Earth' announced on July 31,
 1989, that it had executed Lieutenant Colonel William R. Higgins, a United
 States Marine assigned for service with the United Nations in the U.N. Truce
 Supervision Organization (UNTSO), who was kidnapped in southern Lebanon on
 February 17, 1988.
 (2) That organization claimed to have executed Lieutenant Colonel Higgins in
 response to the capture on July 28, 1989, by Israeli commandos of a radical
 Muslim Shiite leader, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, believed to be associated
 with that organization.
 (3) That organization released to certain news agencies a videotape showing
 Lieutenant Colonel Higgins killed by hanging, though many forensic experts
 believe the videotape indicates that the person shown did not die from
 hanging.
 (4) The kidnapping of Lieutenant Colonel Higgins, who was engaged only in
 carrying out the legitimate United Nations peacekeeping activities to which
 he had been assigned, was wholly unjustified.
 (5) It is absolutely clear that the kidnapping and the murder of Lieutenant
 Colonel Higgins were outrageous acts of terrorism that deserve the
 condemnation of all civilized people.
 (6) There is strong evidence that the Government of Iran has supported the
 organization responsible for Lieutenant Colonel Higgins' kidnapping and
 murder, as well as other terrorist and extremist forces inside Lebanon and
 throughout the Middle East.
 (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS- It is the sense of Congress that--
 (1) Congress is outraged by the kidnapping and murder of Lieutenant Colonel
 Higgins and condemns those actions as barbaric, cowardly, and utterly
 incompatible with the standards of conduct upheld by civilized people;
 (2) the President should use all available resources of the United States
 Government, including diplomatic and intelligence channels, to determine
 the identity of those persons responsible for the kidnapping and murder
 and the details regarding those terrorist acts;
 (3) the President should determine whether it would be possible to identify
 and bring to justice, or to retaliate against, those persons responsible
 for the kidnapping and murder in a manner consistent with United States and
 international legal requirements that would reduce the risk to Americans
 from terrorism;
 (4) the President should take strong and decisive action, possibly including
 the use of military force, to prevent or respond to acts of international
 terrorism. Such actions should be taken in concert with other nations where
 practicable, but the President should be prepared to act unilaterally,
 if necessary;
 (5) the United States should make clear to the new leadership in Iran (A)
 that the United States will not tolerate a continuation of past policies
 of support of groups which undertake terrorist actions against American
 citizens or direct assaults on American vital interests in the Middle East
 or elsewhere, and (B) that if such support should continue, the United
 States will hold the authorities in Iran accountable for that support and
 act accordingly;
 (6) the Secretary General of the United Nations should take all necessary
 steps to help ensure that the body of Lieutenant Colonel Higgins is returned
 to his country and family and that those responsible for his kidnapping
 and murder are immediately brought to justice;
 (7) the President should engage in urgent and continuing diplomatic contacts
 with all other governments concerning their policies and actions which might
 have relevance to the interests of the United States Government or increase
 the vulnerability of the United States citizens to attacks by terrorists; and
 (8) the President should continue to consult with other nations to ensure
 international cooperation and coordination to end terrorist attacks.

 (2) In the report, the Secretary shall also assess whether, in the case of
 a request for an export license involving a country that is considered to
 be a suspect country for purposes of the regime, or involving a commodity
 that is considered to be a suspect commodity for purposes of the regime,
 sufficient information on that request is brought to the attention of the
 Department of Defense before such a license is issued and, if not, what
 measures could be taken to improve Department of Defense oversight of the
 issuance of export licenses in such cases.
 (3) In the report, the Secretary may also address whatever other initiatives
 for the enforcement of the regime the Secretary considers would help
 strengthen the regime.
