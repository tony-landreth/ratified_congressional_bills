One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE FIRST SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the third day of January,
one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
Joint Resolution
Commemorating the bicentennial of the United States Coast Guard.
Whereas August 4, 1990, marks the 200th anniversary of the Act of August 4,
1790, by which Congress authorized 10 revenue cutters requested by Alexander
Hamilton for the purpose of interdicting violators of the customs laws;
Whereas the seagoing service which began with those first 10 cutters lives
on in the form of the service now known as the `United States Coast Guard';
Whereas the Coast Guard has served this Nation well, in war and peace, in
both the defense of this Nation against foreign enemies and against the use
of the sea for crimes against the Nation;
Whereas the Coast Guard has also served this Nation well in protecting against
the perils of the sea, by rescuing those in danger at sea, maintaining aids
to navigation, and regulating the safety of vessels;
Whereas the Coast Guard, despite its small size, has served the Nation in
these and in many other areas with efficiency and gallantry;
Whereas the Coast Guard's present-day battle against the importation of
drugs by sea reminds us of the origins of the Coast Guard with those first
10 cutters 200 years ago, and of the other essential services performed by
the Coast Guard; and
Whereas the bicentennial of the Coast Guard will be commemorated during the
period beginning August 4, 1989, and ending August 4, 1990: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress of the United States
 hereby gives recognition to the two centuries of service by the United
 States Coast Guard and authorizes and requests the President to issue a
 proclamation calling upon the people of the Nation to share in the pride
 and satisfaction enjoyed by the dedicated and committed members of the
 United States Coast Guard during the commemoration of this bicentennial.
