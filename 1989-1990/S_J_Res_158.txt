S.J.Res.158
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating October 21 through October 27, 1990, as `World Population
Awareness Week'.
Whereas the population of the world today exceeds five billion and is growing
at an unprecedented rate of approximately ninety million per year;
Whereas virtually all of this growth is occurring in the poorest countries,
those countries least able to provide even basic services for their current
citizens;
Whereas the demands of growing populations have contributed substantially
to enormous environmental devastation and pose threats of even greater harm
to the world;
Whereas one-half of the ten million infant deaths and one-quarter of the five
hundred thousand maternal deaths that occur each year in the developing world
could be prevented if voluntary child spacing and maternal health programs
could be substantially expanded;
Whereas research reveals that one-half of the women of reproductive age in
the developing world want to limit the size of their families but lack the
means or ability to gain access to family planning;
Whereas the global community has for more than twenty years recognized that
it is a fundamental human right for people to voluntarily and responsibly
determine the number and spacing of their children and the United States
has been a leading advocate of this right;
Whereas the demands of growing populations force many countries to borrow
heavily and sell off their natural resources to cover the interest on
their debt;
Whereas selling off natural resources in such circumstances often causes
irretrievable losses, such as the destruction of the tropical rain forests
at a rate of fifty thousand acres per day;
Whereas the reliance of a rapidly growing world population on burning fuels is
a critical factor in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which
many scientists believe has already catalyzed a warming of the Earth's climate;
Whereas pollution is damaging the ozone layer to such an extent that within
forty years the ultraviolet light reaching our planet is expected to be up
to 20 percent greater than it is today; and
Whereas in 1988, forty State Governors proclaimed `World Population Awareness
Week' in their States to call attention to the consequences of rapid population
growth and the House of Representatives also passed a resolution to that
effect: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That October 21 through October 27, 1990,
 is designated as `World Population Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
