Joint Resolution
Designating the week beginning July 23, 1989, as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week'.
Whereas Lyme disease is spread by the tick species Ixodes Dammini by means
of the bacterium Burrelia Burgdorferi;
Whereas these ticks are no larger than the head of a pin;
Whereas these ticks can be carried by domestic animals such as cats, dogs,
and horses;
Whereas these ticks can be transferred from domestic animals to humans;
Whereas Lyme disease was first diagnosed in southeastern Connecticut and
has spread to forty-three States;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control has reported fourteen thousand cases
of Lyme disease since 1982;
Whereas Lyme disease is easily treated in its early stages by an oral vaccine
administered by a physician (penicillin and erythromycin for young children
and tetracycline for persons allergic to penicillin);
Whereas the early symptoms of Lyme disease are a rash, mild headaches,
a slight fever, and swollen glands;
Whereas Lyme disease often mocks rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease;
Whereas if left untreated, Lyme disease can cause severe depression, brain
disorders, and even death;
Whereas the best cure for Lyme disease is prevention;
Whereas prevention of Lyme disease depends upon public awareness; and
Whereas education is essential to making the general public and health care
professionals more knowledgeable of Lyme disease and its debilitating side
effects: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
 of America in Congress assembled, That the week beginning July 23, 1989,
 is designated as `Lyme Disease Awareness Week', and the President is
 authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of
 the United States to observe such week with appropriate programs, ceremonies,
 and activities.
