 percent) of the producers' 1990 wheat, feed grain, upland cotton, extra long

 shall reduce the percentage of permitted acreage on the farm that may be
 planted to soybeans, sunflowers, and safflowers to a level, or prohibit

 less than 12 1/2  percent nor more than 20 percent;

 U.S.C. 1078-1(a)) is amended--
 (A) by striking `(a) AUTHORITY TO BORROW- Graduate and professional students';
 and inserting the following:
 `(a) Authority To Borrow-
 `(1) STUDENT ELIGIBILITY- Graduate and professional students';
 (B) by indenting the remaining text of subsection (a) two em spaces; and
 (C) by adding at the end thereof the following:
 `(2) INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY- Funds may not be borrowed under this section
 by any undergraduate student who is enrolled at any institution during any
 fiscal year if the cohort default rate for such institution, for the most
 recent fiscal year for which such rates are available, equals or exceeds 30
 percent. The Secretary shall notify institutions to which such restriction
 applies annually, and specify the fiscal year covered by the restriction. The
 Secretary shall afford any institution to which such restriction applies an
 opportunity to present evidence contesting the accuracy of the calculation
 of the cohort default rate for such institution.'.
 (2) DEFINITION- Section 435 of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1085) is amended by
 adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:
 `(m) COHORT DEFAULT RATE- The term `cohort default rate' means, for any fiscal
 year in which 30 or more current and former students at the institution enter
 repayment on loans under section 428 or 428A received for attendance at the
 institution, the percentage of those current and former students who enter
 repayment on such loans received for attendance at that institution in that
 fiscal year who default before the end of the following fiscal year. For any
 fiscal year in which less than 30 of the institution's current and former
 students enter repayment, the term `cohort default rate' means the average
 of the rate calculated under the preceding sentence for the 3 most recent
 fiscal years. In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at
 more than one school, the student (and his or her subsequent repayment or
 default) is attributed to each school for attendance at which the student
 received a loan that entered repayment in the fiscal year. A loan on which
 a payment is made by the school, its owner, agent, contractor, employee,
 or any other entity or individual affiliated with such school, in order to
 avoid default by the borrower, is considered as in default for purposes
 of this subsection. Any loan which has been rehabilitated before the end
 of such following fiscal year is not considered as in default for purposes
 of this subsection. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations designed to
 prevent an institution from evading the application to that institution
 of a default rate determination under this subsection through the use of
 such measures as branching, consolidation, change of ownership or control,
 or any similar device.'.
 (3) Effective date-
 (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amendments made by this
 subsection shall apply to loans made on or after January 1, 1990, and before
 October 1, 1991. Regulations prescribed by the Secretary under the last
 sentence of section 435(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as added
 by such amendments) shall apply with respect to measures described in such
 sentence that are used on or after October 1, 1989.
 (B) The amendments made by this subsection shall not be applied to prevent
 an individual who is enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act in a
 program of instruction for which the individual has obtained a loan under
 section 428A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 from receiving additional
 loans under such section to cover the cost of attendance at that eligible
 institution to complete that program of instruction.
 (C) If, on or after November 8, 1989, the duration of any program of
 instruction is extended, subparagraph (B) shall not permit a student
 enrolled in such program of instruction to receive additional loans under
 such section 428A during the extension.

 whichever is longer, is $4,000, except that in the case of a student who
 has not successfully completed the first year of a program of undergraduate
 education and who is not enrolled in a program that is at least one academic
 year in length, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by
 the Secretary, such maximum amount shall be--
 `(A) $2,500 for a student who is determined, in accordance with such
 regulations, to be enrolled in a program whose length is at least  2/3  of
 an academic year;
 `(B) $1,500 for a student who is determined, in accordance with such
 regulations, to be enrolled in a program whose length is less than  2/3 ,
 but at least  1/3 , of an academic year; and
 `(C) zero for a student who is determined, in accordance with such
 regulations, to be enrolled in a program whose length is less than  1/3
 of an academic year.'.
 (2) EFFECTIVE DATE- The amendment made by this subsection shall apply to
 loans made on or after January 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1991.
 (c) Completion of High School Equivalency Required-
 (1) ABILITY-TO-BENEFIT STUDENTS INELIGIBLE FOR SLS PROGRAM UNTIL GED

 following new sentence: `No student who is admitted on the basis of the
 ability to benefit from the education or training provided by the institution
 (as determined under section 484(d)) shall be eligible to borrow funds
 under this section until such student has obtained a certificate of high
 school equivalency or a high school diploma.'.

 institution (as determined under section 484(d)), the institution will
 make available to such students a program proven successful in assisting
 students in obtaining a certificate of high school equivalency.'.

 `(2) ELIGIBILITY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE DEFAULT REDUCTION PROGRAM- In

 purposes of section 428(c)(2)(D) of amounts paid by any borrower under

 the reinsurance percentage in effect when the payment under the guaranty
 agreement was made with respect to such loan.
 `(b) OTHER REPAYMENT INCENTIVES-
 `(1) SALE OF LOAN-
 `(A) Upon securing consecutive payments for 12 months of amounts owed
 on a loan for which the Secretary has made a payment under paragraph (1)

 of this paragraph shall provide--
 `(i) for the repayment by the agency to the Secretary of 81.5 percent of

 reimburse such agency for the amount expended by it in discharge of its
 insurance obligation under its loan insurance program, and (II) of the
 obligation to pay to the holder of such loan a special allowance pursuant

 in the absence of such error, be in a delinquent status.
 `(2) USE OF PROCEEDS OF SALES- Amounts received by the Secretary pursuant
 to the sale of such loans by a guaranty agency under this paragraph shall
 be deducted from the calculations of the amount of reimbursement for which
 the agency is eligible under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) of this section for the
 fiscal year in which the amount was received, notwithstanding the fact that
 the default occurred in a prior fiscal year.
 `(3) BORROWER ELIGIBILITY- Any borrower whose loan is sold under paragraph
 (1) shall not be precluded by section 484 from receiving additional loans
 under this title (for which he or she is otherwise eligible) on the basis
 of defaulting on the loan prior to such loan sale.
 `(4) APPLICABILITY OF GENERAL LOAN CONDITIONS- A loan which is sold under
 this paragraph shall, so long as the borrower continues to make scheduled
 repayments thereon, be subject to the same terms and conditions and qualify
 for the same benefits and privileges as other loans made under this part.'.

the basis of the action is mailed to the lender (by registered mail, return
receipt requested), take emergency action to stop the issuance of guarantee
commitments and the payment of interest benefits and special allowance to

 the action is mailed to the institution (by registered mail, return receipt
 requested), withhold funds from the institution or its students and withdraw
 the institution's authority to obligate funds under any program under this

 prescribed under this title, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement,
 or limitation,

suspension, or termination proceedings are initiated by the Secretary against
the institution within that period of time, and except that the Secretary

 contracted with an institution to administer any aspect of the institution's
 student assistance program under this title, under which the Secretary shall,

 action is mailed to such individual or organization (by registered mail,
 return receipt requested), withhold funds from the individual or organization

 is violating any provision of this title, any regulation prescribed under
 this title, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation,
 `(ii) determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of
 Federal funds, and

 the procedures prescribed under subparagraph (F), for limitation, suspension,
 or termination,
except that an emergency action shall not exceed 30 days unless the limitation,
suspension, or termination proceedings are initiated by the Secretary against
the individual or organization within that period of time, and except that

 pursuant to section 430(a) or the guaranty agency has made a payment to
 the previous holder of the loan;
 `(9) information regarding any deferments or forbearance granted on such
 loans; and
 `(10) the date of cancellation of the note upon completion of repayment by
 the borrower of the loan or payment by the Secretary pursuant to section 437.

 Section 479A(a) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1987tt(a)) is amended to read
 as follows:
 `SEC. 479A. (a) IN GENERAL- Nothing in this title shall be interpreted as
 limiting the authority of the financial aid administrator, on the basis of
 adequate documentation, to make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to the
 cost of attendance or the data required to calculate the expected student or
 parent contribution (or both) to allow for treatment of an individual eligible
 applicant with special circumstances not addressed by the data elements in
 subparts 1 and 2 of part A and parts B, C, and E of this title. However,
 this authority shall not be construed to permit aid administrators to
 deviate from the contributions expected under subparts 1 and 2 of part
 A and parts B, C, and E in the absence of special circumstances. Special
 circumstances shall be conditions that differentiate an individual student
 from a class of students rather than conditions that exist across a class
 of students. Adequate documentation for such adjustments shall substantiate
 such special circumstances of individual students. In addition, nothing in
 this title shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the student
 financial aid administrator in such cases to request and use supplementary
 information about the financial status or personal circumstances of eligible
 applicants in selecting recipients and determining the amount of awards
 under subparts 1 and 2 of part A and parts B, C, and E of this title.'.

 `(A) pursuant to any settlement agreement with the Secretary, or
 `(B) ordered by a court to be paid by such fiduciary or other person to
 a plan or its participants and beneficiaries in a judicial proceeding
 instituted by the Secretary under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(5).
 `(3) The Secretary may, in the Secretary's sole discretion, waive or reduce
 the penalty under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines in writing that--
 `(A) the fiduciary or other person acted reasonably and in good faith, or
 `(B) it is reasonable to expect that the fiduciary or other person will not
 be able to restore all losses to the plan without severe financial hardship
 unless such waiver or reduction is granted.
 `(4) The penalty imposed on a fiduciary or other person under this subsection
 with respect to any transaction shall be reduced by the amount of any
 penalty or tax imposed on such fiduciary or other person with respect to
 such transaction under subsection (i) of this section and section 4975 of
 the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.'.
 (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 502(a)(6) of the Employee Retirement

 to determine the number of relative value units for physicians' services
 for which specific data are not available and shall take into account
 recommendations of the Physician Payment Review Commission and the results
 of consultations with organizations representing physicians who provide
 such services.
 `(B) PERIODIC REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENTS IN RELATIVE VALUES-

 than (II) the expenditures projected for the fiscal year under clause (ii).
 `(ii) PROJECTED EXPENDITURES- For purposes of clause (i), the expenditures
 projected under this clause for a fiscal year is the actual expenditures
 for physicians' services made under this part in the second preceding
 fiscal year--
 `(I) increased by the weighted average percentage increase permitted under
 this part for physicians' services in the preceding fiscal year;
 `(II) adjusted to reflect the percentage change in the average number
 of individuals enrolled under this part (who are not enrolled with a
 risk-sharing contract under section 1876) for the preceding fiscal year
 compared with the second preceding fiscal year;
 `(III) adjusted to reflect the average annual percentage growth in the
 volume and intensity of physicians' services under this part for the
 five-fiscal-year period ending with the second preceding fiscal year; and
 `(IV) adjusted to reflect the percentage change in expenditures for
 physicians' services under this part in the preceding fiscal year (compared

 Secretary's estimate of the percentage increase in the appropriate update
 index (as defined in clause (ii)) for the year.
 `(ii) APPROPRIATE UPDATE INDEX DEFINED- In clause (i), the term `appropriate
 update index' means--
 `(I) for services for which prevailing charges in 1989 were subject to a
 limit under the fourth sentence of section 1842(b)(3), the medicare economic
 index (referred to in that sentence), and
 `(II) for other services, such index (such as the consumer price index)
 that was applicable under this part in 1989 to increases in the payment
 amounts recognized under this part with respect to such services.
 `(B) ADJUSTMENT IN UPDATE-
 `(i) IN GENERAL- The update for a year provided under subparagraph (A) shall,
 subject to clause (ii), be increased or decreased by the same percentage by
 which (I) the percentage increase in the actual expenditures for physicians'
 services (as defined in section (f)(5)(A)) in the second previous fiscal year
 over the third previous fiscal year, was less or greater, respectively, than
 (II) the performance standard rate of increase (established under subsection
 (f)) for such category of services for the second previous fiscal year.

 in the different fee schedule areas compared to the national average of
 such costs, and
 `(iii) an index which reflects  1/4  of the difference between the relative
 value of physicians' work effort in each of the different fee schedule
 areas and the national average of such work effort.
 `(B) CLASS-SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC COST-OF-PRACTICE INDICES- The Secretary
 may establish more than one index under subparagraph (A)(i) in the case of
 classes of physicians' services, if, because of differences in the mix of
 goods and services comprising practice expenses for the different classes of
 services, the application of a single index under such clause to different
 classes of such services would be substantially inequitable.
 `(2) COMPUTATION OF GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT FACTOR- For purposes of subsection
 (b)(1)(C), for all physicians' services for each fee schedule area the
 Secretary shall establish a geographic adjustment factor equal to the sum of
 the geographic cost-of-practice adjustment factor (specified in paragraph
 (3)), the geographic malpractice adjustment factor (specified in paragraph
 (4)), and the geographic physician work adjustment factor (specified in
 paragraph (5)) for the service and the area.

 the relative value units for the practice expense component, and
 `(B) the geographic cost-of-practice index value for the area for the
 service, based on the index established under paragraph (1)(A)(i) or (1)(B)
 (as the case may be).
 `(4) GEOGRAPHIC MALPRACTICE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR- For purposes of paragraph
 (2), the `geographic malpractice adjustment factor', for a service for a
 fee schedule area, is the product of--

 `(B) the geographic malpractice index value for the area, based on the
 index established under paragraph (1)(A)(ii).
 `(5) GEOGRAPHIC PHYSICIAN WORK ADJUSTMENT FACTOR- For purposes of paragraph
 (2), the `geographic physician work adjustment factor', for a service for
 a fee schedule area, is the product of--

 SERVICES- The Physician Payment Review Commission shall conduct a study
 of the implications of a resource-based fee schedule for physicians'
 services for non-physician practitioners, such as physician assistants,
 clinical psychologists, nurse midwives, and other health practitioners
 whose services can be billed under the medicare program on a fee-for-service
 basis. The study shall address (A) what the proper level of payment should

 `(C) in which the overhead expenses of and the income from the practice are

 a physician for the service, including the request by a physician for a
 consultation with another physician (and any test or procedure ordered by,
 or to be performed by (or under the supervision of) that other physician),
 constitutes a `referral' by a `referring physician'.

 another clinical laboratory service, the request or establishment of a
 plan of care by a physician which includes the provision of the clinical
 laboratory service constitutes a `referral' by a `referring physician'.

 BY CERTAIN SPECIALISTS- A request by a pathologist for clinical diagnostic
 laboratory tests and pathological examination services, if such services

 promptly upon request of the Secretary or a carrier, the entity may be
 subject to a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $2,000, and
 `(ii) if the entity knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails,
 after being notified by the Secretary of the obligations and requirements
 of this subsection to provide the information required under paragraph (1),
 the entity may be subject to exclusion from participation in the programs
 under this Act for a period not to exceed 5 years, in accordance with the
 procedures of subsections (c), (f), and (g) of section 1128.
The provisions of section 1128A (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall

 `(i) which requires that the applicable fraction (as defined in subsection
 (c)(1)) for the building for each taxable year in the extended use period
 will not be less than the applicable fraction specified in such agreement,
 `(ii) which allows individuals who meet the income limitation applicable
 to the building under subsection (g) (whether prospective, present, or
 former occupants of the building) the right to enforce in any State court
 the requirement of clause (i),
 `(iii) which is binding on all successors of the taxpayer, and

 year 1987'.
An amount shall be taken into account as an investment in the project

beginning of the credit period and to the extent such amount is reflected
in the adjusted basis of the project.
 `(ii) COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES IN EXCESS OF 5 PERCENT NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT-
 Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the CPI for any calendar
 year (as defined in section 1(f)(4)) exceeds the CPI for the preceding

 regard to such determination if the failure is corrected within 1 year from
 the date of the determination.

 any refunding bonds with respect thereto) are no longer outstanding.
 `(VI) ELECTION TO REBATE ON EARNINGS ON RESERVE- If the issuer so elects,
 the term `net proceeds' for purposes of subclause (II) shall not include
 earnings on any reasonably required reserve or replacement fund and the

 the proceeds of which are to be used to make or finance loans (other than
 nonpurpose investments) to 2 or more persons, the periods described in clause
 (i) and this clause shall begin on the date the loan is made in the case of
 loans made within the 1-year period after the date the bonds were issued. In
