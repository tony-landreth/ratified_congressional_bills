Joint Resolution
Designating October 13 through 20, 1990, as `American Textile Industry
Bicentennial
Week'.
Whereas in 1790 Samuel Slater, an immigrant mechanic, began producing cotton
yarn via water-powered machinery in Pawtucket, Rhode Island;
Whereas Samuel Slater's success led to the firm establishment of the textile
factory system in the United States of America and helped give birth to the
United States industrial revolution;
Whereas thousands of immigrants from dozens of nations came to the United
States to work in these mills and factories alongside the thousands of
American textile workers;
Whereas the textile industry has played a major role in the development of
the American economy, social system, and political history over the past
200 years; and
Whereas the leaders of the United States textile industry have declared 1990
as `America's Textile Industry Bicentennial Year' in recognition of the 200th
anniversary of the first successful production of cotton yarn in this country:
Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the week of October 13 through October
 20, 1990, is designated as `American Textile Industry Bicentennial Week',
 and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling
 upon the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate
 ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
