 any registered municipal securities dealer, government securities broker,
 or government securities dealer for which the Commission is the appropriate
 regulatory agency, the Commission may require the registered person to make
 reports concerning the financial and securities activities of any of such
 person's associated persons, other than a natural person, whose business
 activities are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial
 or operational condition of such registered person. The Commission, in

 furnished directly to the Commission or to a self-regulatory organization
 with primary responsibility for examining the registered person's financial
 and operational condition.
 `(3) SPECIAL PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ASSOCIATED PERSONS SUBJECT TO
 FEDERAL BANKING AGENCY REGULATION-
 `(A) COOPERATION IN IMPLEMENTATION- In developing and implementing reporting
 requirements pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to
 associated persons subject to examination by or reporting requirements of
 a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall consult with and consider
 the views of each such Federal banking agency. If a Federal banking agency
 comments in writing on a proposed rule of the Commission under this subsection

 section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, section 7(a) of the Federal Deposit
 Insurance Act, section 10(b) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, or section

 information, the Commission shall first request the Federal banking agency
 to expand its reporting requirements to include such information.
 `(C) PROCEDURE FOR REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- Prior to making
 a request pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection for information
 with respect to an associated person that is subject to examination by or
 reporting requirements of a Federal banking agency, the Commission shall--
 `(i) notify such agency of the information required with respect to such
 associated person; and

 be inconsistent with ensuring the financial and operational condition of
 the broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities
 broker, or government securities dealer or the stability or integrity of
 the securities markets.
 `(D) EXCLUSION FOR EXAMINATION REPORTS- Nothing in this subsection shall be
 construed to permit the Commission to require any registered broker or dealer,

 or government securities dealer for which the Commission is the appropriate
 regulatory agency, to obtain, maintain, or furnish any examination report
 of any Federal banking agency or any supervisory recommendations or analysis
 contained therein.

 regarding any associated person which is subject to examination by or

 other person (other than a self-regulatory organization), without the prior
 written approval of the Federal banking agency. Nothing in this subsection
 shall authorize the Commission to withhold information from Congress,

 concerns of the Commission regarding significant financial or operational

 may require the registered person to make reports concerning the financial
 and securities activities of any of such person's associated persons, other

 (a) AUTHORITY TO FACILITATE COORDINATED CLEARING MECHANISMS- Section 17A(a)(2)
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) is amended to read
 as follows:
 `(2)(A) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the
 public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities
 and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers,
 clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this
 title--
 `(i) to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt
 and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities (other
 than exempt securities); and
 `(ii) to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities
 for clearance and settlement of transactions in securities, securities
 options, contracts of sale for future delivery and options thereon, and
 commodity options;
in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth
in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
 `(B) The Commission shall use its authority under this title to assure
 equal regulation under this title of registered clearing agencies and
 registered transfer agents. In carrying out its responsibilities set forth
 in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph, the Commission shall coordinate
 with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and consult with the Board
 of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.'.
 (b) TRANSFER AND PLEDGE OF SECURITIES- Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) is amended by adding at the end the following:
 `(f)(1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, except as provided in
 paragraph (3), if the Commission makes each of the findings described in
 paragraph (2)(A), the Commission may adopt rules concerning--
 `(A) the transfer of certificated or uncertificated securities (other than
 government securities issued pursuant to chapter 31 of title 31, United
 States Code, or securities otherwise processed within a book-entry system
 operated by the Federal Reserve banks pursuant to a Federal book-entry
 regulation) or limited interests (including security interests) therein; and
 `(B) rights and obligations of purchasers, sellers, owners, lenders,
 borrowers, and financial intermediaries (including brokers, dealers, banks,
 and clearing agencies) involved in or affected by such transfers, and the
 rights of third parties whose interests in such securities devolve from
 such transfers.
 `(2)(A) The findings described in this paragraph are findings by the
 Commission that--
 `(i) such rule is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors
 or in the public interest and is reasonably designed to promote the prompt,
 accurate, and safe clearance and settlement of securities transactions;
 `(ii) in the absence of a uniform rule, the safe and efficient operation of
 the national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions
 will be, or is, substantially impeded; and
 `(iii) to the extent such rule will impair or diminish, directly or
 indirectly, rights of persons specified in paragraph (1)(B) under State
 law concerning transfers of securities (or limited interests therein),
 the benefits of such rule outweigh such impairment or diminution of rights.
 `(B) In making the findings described in subparagraph (A), the Commission
 shall give consideration to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee
 established under paragraph (4), and it shall consult with and consider the
 views of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the
 Federal Reserve System. If the Secretary of the Treasury objects, in writing,
 to any proposed rule of the Commission on the basis of the Secretary's view
 on the issues described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A),
 the Commission shall consider all feasible alternatives to the proposed
 rule, and it shall not adopt any such rule unless the Commission makes an
 explicit finding that the rule is the most practicable method for achieving
 safe and efficient operation of the national clearance and settlement system.
 `(3) Any State may, prior to the expiration of 2 years after the Commission
 adopts a rule under this subsection, enact a statute that specifically
 refers to this subsection and the specific rule thereunder and establishes,
 prospectively from the date of enactment of the State statute, a provision
 that differs from that applicable under the Commission's rule.
 `(4)(A) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of this subsection,
 the Commission shall (and at such times thereafter as the Commission may
 determine, the Commission may), after consultation with the Secretary of
 the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
