 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
 States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.
 (a) SHORT TITLE- This Act may be cited as the `Disadvantaged Minority Health
 Improvement Act of 1990'.
 (b) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that--
 (1) racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among
 individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds;
 (2) the health status of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including
 racial and ethnic minorities, in the United States is significantly lower
 than the health status of the general population of the United States;
 (3) minorities suffer disproportionately high rates of cancer, stroke, heart
 diseases, diabetes, substance abuse, acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
 and other diseases and disorders;
 (4) the incidence of infant mortality among minorities is almost double
 that for the general population;
 (5) Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans constitute approximately 12
 percent, 7.9 percent, and 0.01 percent, respectively, of the population of
 the United States;
 (6) Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in the United States constitute
 approximately 3 percent, 4 percent, and less than 0.01 percent, respectively,
 of physicians, 2.7 percent, 1.7 percent, and less than 0.01 percent,
 respectively, of dentists, and 4.5 percent, 1.6 percent, and less than 0.01
 percent, respectively, of nurses;
 (7) the number of individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds in
 health professions should be increased for the purpose of improving the
 access of other such individuals to health services;
 (8) minority health professionals have historically tended to practice in
 low-income areas and to serve minorities;
 (9) minority health professionals have historically tended to engage in
 the general practice of medicine and specialties providing primary care;
 (10) reports published in leading medical journals indicate that access to
 health care among minorities can be substantially improved by increasing
 the number of minority health professionals;
 (11) increasing the number of minorities serving on the faculties of health
 professions schools can be an important factor in attracting minorities to
 pursue a career in the health professions;
 (12) diversity in the faculty and student body of health professions schools
 enhances the quality of education for all students attending the schools;
 (13) the Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health
 (prepared for the Secretary of Health and Human Services and issued in 1985)
 described the health status problems of minorities, and made recommendations
 concerning measures that should be implemented by the Secretary with respect
 to improving the health status of minorities through programs for providing
 health information and education; and
 (14) the Office of Minority Health, created in 1985 by the Secretary
 of Health and Human Services, should be authorized pursuant to statute
 and should receive increased funding to support efforts to improve the
 health of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including minorities,

 Task Force on Black and Minority Health.
