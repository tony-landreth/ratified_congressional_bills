One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating May 13, 1990, as `Infant Mortality Awareness Day'.
Whereas more than 38,000 infants will die this year in the United States
before their first birthday;
Whereas the international ranking of the United States in infant mortality
has declined from 6th in the 1950s to 22nd in the 1980s;
Whereas proper prenatal care has been found to be the single greatest
contributor to the birth of a healthy baby, but 1 in 3 pregnant women does
not receive early and comprehensive prenatal care in the United States;
Whereas low birth weight has been found to be a significant determinant of
infant mortality and 7 percent of all babies born in this country are born
below a healthy birth weight; and
Whereas for every dollar spent on prenatal care for high risk mothers,
there can be a savings of more than $3: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That the Congress of the United States finds
 that situation to be deplorable and designates May 13, 1990, as `Infant
 Mortality Awareness Day', and encourages the citizens of this country to
 work toward the birth of healthy babies to healthy mothers.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
