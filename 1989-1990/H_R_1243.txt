An Act
To require the Secretary of Energy to establish Centers for Metal Casting
Competitiveness Research.
  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
  States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
  This Act may be cited as the `Department of Energy Metal Casting
  Competitiveness Research Act of 1990'.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
  The Congress finds that--
  (1) metal casting is an important process for manufacturing many items
  imported into or exported from the United States;
  (2) the encouragement and maintenance of a technically advanced United
  States metal casting industry is essential to the competitiveness of many
  American industries;
  (3) maintaining a viable metal casting industry is vital to the national
  security and economic well being of the United States;
  (4) the promotion of technology competitiveness and energy efficiency
  in the United States metal casting industry by the Federal Government is
  necessary to maintain a viable metal casting industry;
  (5) many metal casting companies lack the resources to conduct metal
  casting research alone, placing them at a serious competitive disadvantage;
  (6) the support of university-based research in metal casting is important
  in promoting technology development and providing industry with qualified
  engineers; and
  (7) by combining the resources of the Federal Government, universities,
  industry, and private organizations, to conduct research and development
  activities, substantial technological benefits will result to the metal
  casting industry.
