 S. J. Res. 278
One Hundred First Congress of the United States of America
AT THE SECOND SESSION
Begun and held at the City of Washington on Tuesday, the twenty-third day
of January,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety
Joint Resolution
Designating July 19, 1990, as `Flight Attendant Safety Professionals' Day'.
Whereas Federal aviation regulations, since 1952, have required flight
attendants on board all commercial airlines to safeguard the well-being
of passengers;
Whereas flight attendants are trained to respond to medical emergencies and
have assisted in saving passengers' lives in emergencies caused by strokes,
heart attacks, and so forth;
Whereas flight attendants' professionalism and calmness in evacuations of
crashed airplanes have saved thousands of lives that otherwise would have
been lost;
Whereas flight attendants have given their lives to save passengers in
emergency evacuations, sustaining an on-the-job fatality rate higher than
that of police officers;
Whereas flight attendants have assisted in hundreds of in-flight emergencies
due to hijackings, terrorist acts, decompressions, and severe turbulence; and
Whereas flight attendants have vigorously strived for safety improvements
at their airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration and have worked
diligently to educate the flying public of safety procedures: Now, therefore,
be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
 America in Congress assembled, That July 19, 1990, is designated as `Flight
 Attendant Safety Professionals' Day', and the President is requested to issue
 a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such
 day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Vice President of the United States and
President of the Senate.
