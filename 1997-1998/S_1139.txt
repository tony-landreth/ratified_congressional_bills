        contract that is entered into to meet requirements that are 
        consolidated in a bundling of contract requirements.
            ``(2) Bundling of contract requirements.--The term `bundling 
        of contract requirements' means consolidating 2 or more 
        procurement requirements for goods or services previously 
        provided or performed under separate smaller contracts into a 
        solicitation of offers for a single contract that is likely to 
        be unsuitable for award to a small-business concern due to--
                    ``(A) the diversity, size, or specialized nature of 
                the elements of the performance specified;

SEC. 413. ASSESSING PROPOSED CONTRACT BUNDLING.

    (a) In General.--Section 15 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
644) is amended by inserting after subsection (d) the following:
    ``(e) Procurement Strategies; Contract Bundling.--
            ``(1) In general.--To the maximum extent practicable, 
        procurement strategies used by the various agencies having 
        contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation 
        of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, 
        and suppliers.
            ``(2) Market research.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Before proceeding with an 
                acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract 
                containing consolidated procurement requirements, the 
                head of an agency shall conduct market research to 
                determine whether consolidation of the requirements is 
                necessary and justified.
                    ``(B) Factors.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), 
                consolidation of the requirements may be determined as 
                being necessary and justified if, as compared to the 
                benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet 
                those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal 
                Government would derive from the consolidation 
                measurably substantial benefits, including any 
                combination of benefits that, in combination, are 
                measurably substantial. Benefits described in the 
                preceding sentence may include the following:
                          ``(i) Cost savings.
                          ``(ii) Quality improvements.
                          ``(iii) Reduction in acquisition cycle times.
                          ``(iv) Better terms and conditions.
                          ``(v) Any other benefits.
                    ``(C) Reduction of costs not determinative.--The 
                reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone 
                shall not be a justification for bundling of contract 
                requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be 
                substantial in relation to the dollar value of the 
                procurement requirements to be consolidated.
            ``(3) Strategy specifications.--If the head of a contracting 
        agency determines that a proposed procurement strategy for a 
        procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract 
        requirements, the proposed procurement strategy shall--
                    ``(A) identify specifically the benefits anticipated 
                to be derived from the bundling of contract 
                requirements;
                    ``(B) set forth an assessment of the specific 
                impediments to participation by small business concerns 
                as prime contractors that result from the bundling of 
                contract requirements and specify actions designed to 
                maximize small business participation as subcontractors 
                (including suppliers) at various tiers under the 
                contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the 
                requirements; and
                    ``(C) include a specific determination that the 
                anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract 
                justify its use.
            ``(4) Contract teaming.--In the case of a solicitation of 
        offers for a bundled contract that is issued by the head of an 
        agency, a small-business concern may submit an offer that 
        provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors for

[[Page 111 STAT. 2619]]

        the performance of the contract. The head of the agency shall 
        evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers, with due 
        consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed 
        subcontractors. If a small business concern teams under this 
        paragraph, it shall not affect its status as a small business 
        concern for any other purpose.''.

    (b) Administration Review.--Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act 
(15 U.S.C. 644(a)) is amended in the third sentence--
            (1) by inserting ``or the solicitation involves an 
        unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as 
        determined by the Administration,'' after ``discrete 
        construction projects,'';
            (2) by striking ``or (4)'' and inserting ``(4)''; and
            (3) by inserting before the period at the end of the 
        sentence the following: ``, or (5) why the agency has determined 
        that the bundled contract (as defined in section 3(o)) is 
        necessary and justified''.

    (c) Responsibilities of Agency Small Business Advocates.--Section 
15(k) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (9) as 
        paragraphs (6) through (10), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:
            ``(5) identify proposed solicitations that involve 
        significant bundling of contract requirements, and work with the 
        agency acquisition officials and the Administration to revise 
        the procurement strategies for such proposed solicitations where 
        appropriate to increase the probability of participation by 
        small businesses as prime contractors, or to facilitate small 
        business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a 
        solicitation for a bundled contract is to be issued;''.
