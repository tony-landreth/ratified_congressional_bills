SEC. 2. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 12 USC 1751 note.>> 

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The American credit union movement began as a 
        cooperative effort to serve the productive and provident credit 
        needs of individuals of modest means.
            (2) Credit unions continue to fulfill this public purpose, 
        and current members and membership groups should not face 
        divestiture from the financial services institution of their 
        choice as a result of recent court action.

[[Page 112 STAT. 914]]

            (3) To promote thrift and credit extension, a meaningful 
        affinity and bond among members, manifested by a commonality of 
        routine interaction, shared and related work experiences, 
        interests, or activities, or the maintenance of an otherwise 
        well-understood sense of cohesion or identity is essential to 
        the fulfillment of the public mission of credit unions.
            (4) Credit unions, unlike many other participants in the 
        financial services market, are exempt from Federal and most 
        State taxes because they are member-owned, democratically 
        operated, not-for-profit organizations generally managed by 
        volunteer boards of directors and because they have the 
        specified mission of meeting the credit and savings needs of 
        consumers, especially persons of modest means.
            (5) Improved credit union safety and soundness provisions 
        will enhance the public benefit that citizens receive from these 
        cooperative financial services institutions.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. <<NOTE: 12 USC 1790d note.>>

        Administration Board;
            (3) the term ``Federal banking agencies'' has the same 
        meaning as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;
            (4) the terms ``insured credit union'' and ``State-chartered

amended--
            (1) in the first sentence--
                    (A) by striking ``Federal credit union membership 
                shall consist of '' and inserting ``(a) In General.--

                membership shall consist of ''; and
                    (B) by striking ``, except that'' and all that 
                follows through ``rural district''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:

    ``(b) Membership Field.--Subject to the other provisions of this

        common bond of occupation or association.

                time the group is first included within the field of 
                membership of a credit union described in this 
                paragraph) does not exceed any numerical limitation 
                applicable under subsection (d).
            ``(3) Community credit union.--Persons or organizations 
        within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural

                      Act may remain a member of the credit union after 
                      that date of enactment; and
                          ``(ii) a member of any group whose members 
                      constituted a portion of the membership of any

                      shall continue to be eligible to become a member 
                      of that credit union, by virtue of membership in 
                      that group, after that date of enactment.
                    ``(B) Successors.--If the common bond of any group 
                referred to in subparagraph (A) is defined by any 
                particular organization or business entity, subparagraph 
                (A) shall continue to apply with respect to any 
                successor to the organization or entity.
            ``(2) Exception for underserved areas.--Notwithstanding 
        subsection (b), in the case of a Federal credit union, the field 
        of membership category of which is described in subsection 
        (b)(2), the Board may allow the membership of the credit union 
        to include any person or organization within a local community, 
        neighborhood, or rural district if--

Requirements.--

        in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the 
        immediate family or household (as those terms are defined by the 
        Board, by regulation) of the other person.

SEC. 102. CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF EXPANSION OF MEMBERSHIP OF MULTIPLE 
            COMMON-BOND CREDIT UNIONS.

    Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1759) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(f ) Criteria for Approval of Expansion of Multiple 
Common-Bond Credit Unions.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Board shall--
                    ``(A) encourage the formation of separately 
                chartered credit unions instead of approving an 
                application to include an additional group within the 
                field of membership of an existing credit union whenever 
                practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for 
                the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and
                    ``(B) if the formation of a separate credit union by 
                the group is not practicable or consistent with the 
                standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the 
                inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a 
                credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the 
                location of the group whenever practicable and 
                consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and 
                sound operation of the credit union.
            ``(2) Approval criteria.--The Board may not approve any 
        application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership 
        category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) to include 
        any additional group within the field of membership of the 
        credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union 
        described in subsection (b)(1) to include an additional group 
        and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2)), 
        unless the Board determines, in writing, that--
                    ``(A) the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe 
                or unsound practice (as defined in section 206(b)) that 
                is material during the 1-year period preceding the date 
                of filing of the application;
                    ``(B) the credit union is adequately capitalized;
                    ``(C) the credit union has the administrative 
                capability to serve the proposed membership group and 
                the financial resources to meet the need for additional 
                staff and assets to serve the new membership group;
                    ``(D) any potential harm that the expansion of the 
                field of membership of the credit union may have on any 
                other insured credit union and its members is clearly 
                outweighed in the public interest by the probable 
                beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the 
                convenience and needs of the members of the group 
                proposed to be included in the field of membership; and
                    ``(E) the credit union has met such additional 
                requirements as the Board may prescribe, by 
                regulation.''.

SEC. 103. GEOGRAPHICAL GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITY CREDIT UNIONS.

    Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1759) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Regulations Required for Community Credit Unions.--

[[Page 112 STAT. 918]]

            ``(1) Definition of well-defined local community, 
        neighborhood, or rural district.--The Board shall prescribe, by

                respect to any such determination.

        the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any 
        application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand 
        the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is 
        filed with the Board after the date of enactment of the Credit 
        Union Membership Access Act.''.

                      accepted accounting principle to any insured 
                      credit union is not appropriate, the Board may 
                      prescribe an accounting principle for application 
                      to the credit union that is no less stringent than 
                      generally accepted accounting principles.
