SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Brule Sioux Tribe 
Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) under the Act of December 22, 1944, commonly known as 
        the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. 887, chapter 665; 33 
        U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.) Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri 
        River Basin program--
                    (A) to promote the general economic development of 
                the United States;
                    (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, 
                Iowa;
                    (C) to protect urban and rural areas from 
                devastating floods of the Missouri River; and
                    (D) for other purposes;
            (2) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects are major 
        components of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, and 
        contribute to the national economy by generating a substantial 
        amount of hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of 
        water;
            (3) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects overlie the 
        eastern boundary of the Lower Brule Indian Reservation, having 
        inundated the fertile, wooded bottom lands of the Tribe along 
        the Missouri River that constituted the most productive 
        agricultural and pastoral lands of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe 
        and the homeland of the members of the Tribe;
            (4) Public Law 85-923 (72 Stat. 1773 et seq.) authorized the 
        acquisition of 7,997 acres of Indian land on the Lower Brule 
        Indian Reservation for the Fort Randall project and Public Law 
        87-734 (76 Stat. 698 et seq.) authorized the acquisition of 
        14,299 acres of Indian land on the Lower Brule Indian 
        Reservation for the Big Bend project;

[[Page 111 STAT. 2564]]

            (5) Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 et seq.) provided for 
        the mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall and Big Bend 
        projects on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation, by directing the 
        Secretary of the Army to--
                    (A) as necessary, by reason of the Big Bend project, 
                protect, replace, relocate, or reconstruct--
                          (i) any essential governmental and agency 
                      facilities on the reservation, including schools, 
                      hospitals, offices of the Public Health Service 
                      and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, service 
                      buildings, and employee quarters existing at the 
                      time that the projects were carried out; and
                          (ii) roads, bridges, and incidental matters or 
                      facilities in connection with those facilities;
                    (B) provide for a townsite adequate for 50 homes, 
                including streets and utilities (including water, 
                sewage, and electricity), taking into account the 
                reasonable future growth of the townsite; and
                    (C) provide for a community center containing space 
                and facilities for community gatherings, tribal offices, 
                tribal council chamber, offices of the Bureau of Indian 
                Affairs, offices and quarters of the Public Health 
                Service, and a combination gymnasium and auditorium;
            (6) the requirements under Public Law 87-734 (76 Stat. 698 
        et seq.) with respect to the mitigation of the effects of the 
        Fort Randall and Big Bend projects on the Lower Brule Indian 
        Reservation have not been fulfilled;
            (7) although the national economy has benefited from the 
        Fort Randall and Big Bend projects, the economy on the Lower 
        Brule Indian Reservation remains underdeveloped, in part as a 
        consequence of the failure of the Federal Government to fulfill 
        the obligations of the Federal Government under the laws 
        referred to in paragraph (4);
            (8) the economic and social development and cultural 
        preservation of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will be enhanced by 
        increased tribal participation in the benefits of the Fort 
        Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River 
        Basin program; and
            (9) the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is entitled to additional 
        benefits of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program.
