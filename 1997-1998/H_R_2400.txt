        subsection limits the eligibility of an entity or person to 
        receive funds made available under titles I, III, and V of this 
        Act, if the entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, 
        from complying with paragraph (1) because a Federal court issues 
        a final order in which the court finds that the requirement of 
        paragraph (1), or the program established under paragraph (1),

        guarantee program for such fiscal year exceed $2,639,000,000, 
        and the Appalachian development highway system program) that are 
        apportioned by the Secretary under this Act and title 23, United

to those previously distributed during that fiscal year giving priority 
to those States having large unobligated balances of funds apportioned 
under sections 104 and 144 of title 23, United States Code, under 
section 160 of title 23, United States Code (as in effect on the day

United States Code, and chapter 4 of title 23, United States Code, and 
(2) that the Secretary determines will not be allocated to the States, 
and will not be available for obligation, in such fiscal year due to the 
imposition of any

[[Page 112 STAT. 118]]

obligation limitation for such fiscal year. Such distribution to the 
States shall be made in the same ratio as the distribution of obligation 
authority under subsection (c)(6). The funds so distributed shall be 
available for any purposes described in section 133(b) of title 23, 
United States Code.
    (g) Special Rule.--Obligation authority distributed for a fiscal 
year under subsection (c)(4) for a section set forth in subsection 
(c)(4) shall remain available until used for obligation of funds for 
such section and shall be in addition to the amount of any limitation 
imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and highway safety 
construction programs for future fiscal years.

SEC. 1309. ENVIRONMENTAL STREAMLINING. <<NOTE: 23 USC 109 note.>> 

    (a) Coordinated Environmental Review Process.--
            (1) Development and implementation.--The Secretary shall 
        develop and implement a coordinated environmental review process 
        for highway construction projects that require--
                    (A) the preparation of an environmental impact 
                statement or environmental assessment under the National 
                Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
                seq.), except that the Secretary may decide not to apply 
                this section to the preparation of an environmental 
                assessment under such Act; or
                    (B) the conduct of any other environmental review, 
                analysis, opinion, or issuance of an environmental 
                permit, license, or approval by operation of Federal 
                law.
            (2) Memorandum of understanding.--
                    (A) In general.--The coordinated environmental 
                review process for each project shall ensure that, 
                whenever practicable (as specified in this section), all 
                environmental reviews, analyses, opinions, and any 
                permits, licenses, or approvals that must be issued or 
                made by any Federal agency for the project concerned 
                shall be conducted concurrently and completed within a 
                cooperatively determined time period. Such process for a 
                project or class of project may be incorporated into a 
                memorandum of understanding between the Department of 
                Transportation and Federal agencies (and, where 
                appropriate, State agencies).
                    (B) Establishment of time periods.--In establishing 
                the time period referred to in subparagraph (A), and any 
                time periods for review within such period, the 
                Department and all such agencies shall take into account 
                their respective resources and statutory commitments.

    (b) Elements of Coordinated Environmental Review 
Process.--For each project, the coordinated environmental review process 
established under this section shall provide, at a minimum, for the 
following elements:
            (1) Federal agency identification.--The Secretary shall, at 
        the earliest possible time, identify all potential Federal 
        agencies that--
                    (A) have jurisdiction by law over environmental-
                related issues that may be affected by the project and 
                the analysis of which would be part of any environmental 
                document required by the National Environmental Policy 
                Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); or
                    (B) may be required by Federal law to 
                independently--
                          (i) conduct an environmental-related review or 
                      analysis; or
                          (ii) determine whether to issue a permit, 
                      license, or approval or render an opinion on the 
                      environmental impact of the project.

[[Page 112 STAT. 233]]

            (2) Time limitations and concurrent review.--The Secretary 
        and the head of each Federal agency identified under paragraph 
        (1)--
                    (A)(i) shall jointly develop and establish time 
                periods for review for--
                          (I) all Federal agency comments with respect 
                      to any environmental review documents required by 
                      the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
                      U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for the project; and
                          (II) all other independent Federal agency 
                      environmental analyses, reviews, opinions, and 
                      decisions on any permits, licenses, and approvals 
                      that must be issued or made for the project;
                whereby each such Federal agency's review shall be 
                undertaken and completed within such established time 
                periods for review; or
                    (ii) may enter into an agreement to establish such 
                time periods for review with respect to a class of 
                project; and
                    (B) shall ensure, in establishing such time periods 
                for review, that the conduct of any such analysis, 
                review, opinion, and decision is undertaken concurrently 
                with all other environmental reviews for the project, 
                including the reviews required by the National 
                Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et 
                seq.); except that such review may not be concurrent if 
                the affected Federal agency can demonstrate that such 
                concurrent review would result in a significant adverse 
                impact to the environment or substantively alter the 
                operation of Federal law or would not be possible 
                without information developed as part of the 
                environmental review process.
            (3) Factors to be considered.--Time periods for review 
        established under this section shall be consistent with the time 
        periods established by the Council on Environmental Quality 
        under sections 1501.8 and 1506.10 of title 40, Code of Federal 
        Regulations.
            (4) Extensions.--The Secretary shall extend any time periods 
        for review under this section if, upon good cause shown, the 
        Secretary and any Federal agency concerned determine that 
        additional time for analysis and review is needed as a result of 
        new information that has been discovered that could not 
        reasonably have been anticipated when the Federal agency's time 
        periods for review were established. Any memorandum of 
        understanding shall be modified to incorporate any mutually 
        agreed-upon extensions.

    (c) Dispute Resolution.--When the Secretary determines that a 
Federal agency which is subject to a time period for its environmental 
review or analysis under this section has failed to complete such 
review, analysis, opinion, or decision on issuing any permit, license, 
or approval within the established time period or within any agreed-upon 
extension to such time period, the Secretary may, after notice and 
consultation with such agency, close the record on the matter before the 
Secretary. If the Secretary finds, after timely compliance with this 
section, that an environmental issue related to the project that an 
affected Federal agency has jurisdiction over by operation of Federal 
law has not been resolved, the Secretary and the head of the Federal 
agency shall resolve the

[[Page 112 STAT. 234]]

matter not later than 30 days after the date of the finding by the 
Secretary.
    (d) Participation of State Agencies.--For any project eligible for 
assistance under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, a State, by 
operation of State law, may require that all State agencies that have 
jurisdiction by State or Federal law over environmental-related issues 
that may be affected by the project, or that are required to issue any 
environmental-related reviews, analyses, opinions, or determinations on 
issuing any permits, licenses, or approvals for the project, be subject 
to the coordinated environmental review process established under this 
section unless the Secretary determines that a State's participation 
would not be in the public interest. For a State to require State 
agencies to participate in the review process, all affected agencies of 
the State shall be subject to the review process.
    (e) Assistance to Affected Federal Agencies.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may approve a request by a 
        State to provide funds made available under chapter 1 of title 
        23, United States Code, to the State for the project subject to 
        the coordinated environmental review process established under 
        this section to affected Federal agencies to provide the 
        resources necessary to meet any time limits established under 
        this section.
            (2) Amounts.--Such requests under paragraph (1) shall be 
        approved only--
                    (A) for the additional amounts that the Secretary 
                determines are necessary for the affected Federal 
                agencies to meet the time limits for environmental 
                review; and
                    (B) if such time limits are less than the customary 
                time necessary for such review.

    (f) Judicial Review and Savings Clause.--
            (1) Judicial review.--Nothing in this section shall affect 
        the reviewability of any final Federal agency action in a 
        district court of the United States or in the court of any 
        State.
            (2) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section shall affect 
        the applicability of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) or any other Federal environmental 
        statute or affect the responsibility of any Federal officer to 
        comply with or enforce any such statute.

    (g) Federal Agency Defined.--In this section, the term ``Federal 
agency'' means any Federal agency or any State agency carrying out 
affected responsibilities required by operation of Federal law.

            note.>> 

    (a) Crash Cushions.--
            (1) Guidance.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue guidance 
        regarding the benefits and safety performance of redirective and 
        nonredirective crash cushions in different road applications, 
        taking into consideration roadway conditions, operating speed 
        limits, the location of the crash cushion in the right-of-way, 
        and any other relevant factors. The guidance shall include 
        recommendations on the most appropriate circumstances for 
        utilization of redirective and nonredirective crash cushions.
            (2) Use of guidance.--States shall use the guidance issued 
        under this subsection in evaluating the safety and cost-
        effectiveness of utilizing different crash cushion designs and

        or other safety appurtenances should be installed at specific 
        highway locations.

    (b) Traffic Flow and Safety Applications of Road 
Barriers.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on the 
        technologies and methods to enhance safety, streamline 
        construction, and improve capacity by providing positive 
        separation at all times between traffic, equipment, and workers 
        on highway construction projects. The study shall also address 
        how such technologies can be used to improve capacity and safety 
        at those specific highway, bridge, and other appropriate 
        locations where reversible lane, contraflow, and high occupancy 
        vehicle lane operations are implemented during peak traffic 
        periods.
            (2) Uses to consider.--In conducting the study, the 
        Secretary shall consider, at a minimum, uses of positive 
        separation technologies related to--
                    (A) separating workers from traffic flow when work 
                is in progress;
                    (B) providing additional safe work space by 
                utilizing adjacent and available traffic lanes during 
                off-peak hours;
                    (C) rapid deployment to allow for daily or periodic 
                restoration of lanes for use by traffic during peak 
                hours as needed;
                    (D) mitigating congestion caused by construction 
                by--
                          (i) opening all adjacent and available lanes 
                      to traffic during peak traffic hours; or
                          (ii) using reversible lanes to optimize 
                      capacity of the highway by adjusting to 
                      directional traffic flow; and
                    (E) permanent use of positive separation 
                technologies to create contraflow or reversible lanes to 
                increase the capacity of congested highways, bridges, 
                and tunnels.

[[Page 112 STAT. 237]]

            (3) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 
        report on the results of the study. The report shall include 
        findings and recommendations for the use of the technologies 
        referred to in paragraph (2) to provide positive separation on 
        appropriate projects.

    CHAPTER 1--TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE <<NOTE: Transportation 
   Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998. Grants. Inter- 
governmental relations. Loans.>>  FINANCE AND INNOVATION

SEC. 1501. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 23 USC 101 note.>> 

    This chapter may be cited as the ``Transportation Infrastructure 
Finance and Innovation Act of 1998''.

SEC. 1502. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 23 USC 181 note.>> 

    Congress finds that--
            (1) a well-developed system of transportation infrastructure 
        is critical to the economic well-being, health, and welfare of 
        the people of the United States;
            (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant 
        programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure 
        investment needs of the United States because of budgetary 
        constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of 
        government;
            (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that 
        address critical national needs, such as intermodal facilities, 
        border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, are of a scale 
        that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State assistance 
        programs in effect on the date of enactment of this Act;
            (4) new investment capital can be attracted to 
        infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their own 
        revenue streams through user charges or other dedicated funding 
        sources; and
            (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national 
        significance can complement existing funding resources by 
        filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private co-
        investment.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 3 months after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the 
Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to 
conduct a study of the effect of contracting out mass transportation 
operation and administrative functions on cost, availability and level 
of service, efficiency, safety, quality of services provided to transit-
dependent populations, and employer-employee relations.
    (b) Terms of Agreement.--The agreement entered into in subsection 
(a) shall provide that--
            (1) the Transportation Research Board, in conducting the 
        study, consider the number of grant recipients that have 
        contracted out services, the size of the population served by 
        such grant recipients, the basis for decisions regarding 
        contracting out, and the extent to which contracting out was 
        affected by the integration and coordination of resources of 
        transit agencies and other Federal agencies and programs; and

[[Page 112 STAT. 386]]

            (2) the panel conducting the study shall include

the formula for apportioning funds to urbanized areas under section 5336 
of title 49, United States Code, accurately reflects the transit needs 
of the urbanized areas and, if not, whether any changes should be made 
either to the formula or through some other mechanism to reflect the 
fact that some urbanized areas with a population between 50,000 and 
200,000 have transit systems that carry more passengers per mile or hour 
than the average of those transit systems in urbanized areas with a 
population over 200,000.

            (1) two-thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, whereas 
        three-quarters of welfare recipients live in rural areas or 
        central cities;
            (2) even in metropolitan areas with excellent public transit 
        systems, less than half of the jobs are accessible by transit;
            (3) in 1991, the median price of a new car was equivalent to 
        25 weeks of salary for the average worker, and considerably more 
        for the low-income worker;
            (4) not less than 9,000,000 households and 10,000,000 
        Americans of driving age, most of whom are low-income workers, 
        do not own cars;
            (5) 94 percent of welfare recipients do not own cars;
            (6) nearly 40 percent of workers with annual incomes below 
        $10,000 do not commute by car;
            (7) many of the 2,000,000 Americans who will have their 
        Temporary Assistance to Needy Families grants (under the State 
        program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)) terminated by the year 2002 will be 
        unable to get to jobs they could otherwise hold;
            (8) increasing the transit options for low-income workers, 
        especially those who are receiving or who have recently received

[[Page 112 STAT. 388]]

        welfare benefits, will increase the likelihood of those workers 
        getting and keeping jobs; and
            (9) many residents of cities and rural areas would like to 
        take advantage of mass transit to gain access to suburban 
        employment opportunities.

        is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be 
        achieved absent such exemption. An exemption may be granted for 
        no longer than 2 years from its approval date and may be renewed

        exemption. The Secretary shall monitor the implementation of the 
        exemption to ensure compliance with its terms and conditions.

            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may conduct pilot programs 
        to evaluate alternatives to regulations relating to, or 
        innovative approaches to, motor carrier, commercial motor 
        vehicle, and driver safety. Such pilot programs may include 
        exemptions from a regulation prescribed under this chapter or

        shall immediately revoke participation in a pilot program of a 
        motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, or driver for failure

SEC. 5213. REPEAL. <<NOTE: 23 USC 502 note.>> 

    The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 is 
amended by striking part B of title VI (23 U.S.C. 307 note; 105 Stat. 
2189).

            TITLE VI--OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARDS

SEC. 6101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7407 note.>> 

    (a) The Congress finds that--
            (1) there is a lack of air quality monitoring data for fine 
        particle levels, measured as PM<INF>2.5</INF>, in the United 
        States and the States should receive full funding for the 
        monitoring efforts;
            (2) such data would provide a basis for designating areas as 
        attainment or nonattainment for any PM<INF>2.5</INF> national 
        ambient air quality standards pursuant to the standards 
        promulgated in July 1997;
            (3) the President of the United States directed the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (referred 
        to in this title as the ``Administrator'') in a memorandum dated 
        July 16, 1997, to complete the next periodic review of the 
        particulate matter national ambient air quality standards by 
        July 2002 in order to determine ``whether to revise or maintain 
        the standards'';
            (4) the Administrator has stated that 3 years of air quality 
        monitoring data for fine particle levels, measured as 
        PM<INF>2.5</INF> and performed in accordance with any applicable 
        Federal reference methods, is appropriate for designating areas 
        as attainment or nonattainment pursuant to the July 1997 
        promulgated standards; and
            (5) the Administrator has acknowledged that in drawing 
        boundaries for attainment and nonattainment areas for the July 
        1997 ozone national air quality standards, Governors would 
        benefit from considering implementation guidance from EPA on 
        drawing area boundaries.

    (b) The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to ensure that 3 years of air quality monitoring data 
        regarding fine particle levels are gathered for use in the 
        determination of area attainment or nonattainment designations 
        respecting any PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality 
        standards;
            (2) to ensure that the Governors have adequate time to 
        consider implementation guidance from EPA on drawing area 
        boundaries prior to submitting area designations respecting the 
        July 1997 ozone national ambient air quality standards;
            (3) to ensure that the schedule for implementation of the 
        July 1997 revisions of the ambient air quality standards for 
        particulate matter and the schedule for the Environmental

[[Page 112 STAT. 464]]

         Protection Agency's visibility regulations related to regional 
        haze are consistent with the timetable for implementation of 
        such particulate matter standards as set forth in the 
        President's Implementation Memorandum dated July 16, 1997.

SEC. 6102. PARTICULATE MATTER MONITORING PROGRAM. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7407 
            note.>> 

    (a) Through grants under section 103 of the Clean Air Act the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall use 
appropriated funds no later than fiscal year 2000 to fund 100 percent of 
the cost of the establishment, purchase, operation and maintenance of a 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitoring network necessary to implement the national 
ambient air quality standards for PM<INF>2.5</INF> under section 109 of 
the Clean Air Act. This implementation shall not result in a diversion 
or reprogramming of funds from other Federal, State or local Clean Air 
Act activities. Any funds previously diverted or reprogrammed from 
section 105 Clean Air Act grants for PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors must be 
restored to State or local air programs in fiscal year 1999.
    (b) EPA and the States, consistent with their respective authorities 
under the Clean Air Act, shall ensure that the national network 
(designated in subsection (a)) which consists of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitors necessary to implement the national ambient air quality 
standards is established by December 31, 1999.
    (c)(1) The Governors shall be required to submit designations 
referred to in section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act for each area 
following promulgation of the July 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national 
ambient air quality standard within 1 year after receipt of 3 years of 
air quality monitoring data performed in accordance with any applicable 
Federal reference methods for the relevant areas. Only data from the 
monitoring network designated in subsection (a) and other Federal 
reference method PM<INF>2.5</INF> monitors shall be considered for such 
designations. Nothing in the previous sentence shall be construed as 
affecting the Governor's authority to designate an area initially as 
nonattainment, and the Administrator's authority to promulgate the 
designation of an area as nonattainment, under section 107(d)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act, based on its contribution to ambient air quality in a 
nearby nonattainment area.
    (2) For any area designated as nonattainment for the July 1997 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient air quality standard in accordance 
with the schedule set forth in this section, notwithstanding the time 
limit prescribed in paragraph (2) of section 169B(e) of the Clean Air 
Act, the Administrator shall require State implementation plan revisions 
referred to in such paragraph (2) to be submitted at the same time as 
State implementation plan revisions referred to in section 172 of the 
Clean Air Act implementing the revised national ambient air quality 
standard for fine particulate matter are required to be submitted. For 
any area designated as attainment or unclassifiable for such standard, 
the Administrator shall require the State implementation plan revisions 
referred to in such paragraph (2) to be submitted 1 year after the area 
has been so designated. The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall 
not preclude the implementation of the agreements and recommendations 
set forth in the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission Report 
dated June 1996.
    (d) The Administrator shall promulgate the designations referred to 
in section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act for each area following 
promulgation of the July 1997 PM<INF>2.5</INF> national ambient

[[Page 112 STAT. 465]]

air quality standard by the earlier of 1 year after the initial 
designations required under subsection (c)(1) are required to be 
submitted or December 31, 2005.
    (e) The Administrator shall conduct a field study of the ability of 
the PM<INF>2.5</INF> Federal Reference Method to differentiate those 
particles that are larger than 2.5 micrograms in diameter. This study 
shall be completed and provided to the Committee on Commerce of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public 
Works of the United States Senate no later than 2 years from the date of 
enactment of this Act.

SEC. 6103. OZONE DESIGNATION REQUIREMENTS. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7407 note.>> 

    (a) The Governors shall be required to submit the designations 
referred to in section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act within 2 years 
following the promulgation of the July 1997 ozone national ambient air 
quality standards.
    (b) The Administrator shall promulgate final designations no later 
than 1 year after the designations required under subsection (a) are 
required to be submitted.

SEC. 6104. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7407 note.>> 

    Nothing in sections 6101 through 6103 shall be construed by the 
Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency or any court, State, or 
person to affect any pending litigation or to be a ratification of the 
ozone or PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards.

        balances of credit risk premiums to adequately protect the 
        Federal Government from risk of default, while minimizing the 
        length of time the Government retains possession of those 
        balances, the Secretary shall establish cohorts of loans. When 
        all obligations attached to a cohort of loans have been 
        satisfied, credit risk premiums paid for the cohort, and 
        interest accrued thereon, which were not used to mitigate losses

direct loan or loan guarantee under this section unless the Secretary 
has made a finding in writing that--

        facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved, 
        developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation 
        will be economically and efficiently utilized;
            ``(4) the obligation can reasonably be repaid, using an 
        appropriate combination of credit risk premiums and collateral 
        offered by the applicant to protect the Federal Government; and

granting assistance under this section, require the applicant to agree 
to such terms and conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the 
Secretary, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due 
and payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or 
railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended--
            ``(1) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or 
        intermodal operations for purposes not related to such 
        operations, if such use would impair the ability of the 
        applicant,

        services in an efficient and economic manner, or would adversely 
        affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or railroad 
        partner to perform any obligation entered into by the applicant 
        under this section;

        unreasonably conflict with the purposes stated in subsection 
        (b).

``SEC. 503. <<NOTE: 45 USC 823 note.>>  ADMINISTRATION OF DIRECT LOANS 
            AND LOAN GUARANTEES.

    ``(a) Applications.--The Secretary shall prescribe the form and 
contents required of applications for assistance under section 502, to 
enable the Secretary to determine the eligibility of the applicant's 
proposal, and shall establish terms and conditions for direct loans and 
loan guarantees made under that section.

terms. Such a guarantee or commitment shall be valid and incontestable 
in the hands of a holder thereof, including the original lender or any 
other holder, as of the date when the Secretary granted the application 
therefor, except as to fraud or material misrepresentation by such 
holder.

prescribe regulations setting forth procedures in the event of default 
on a loan made or guaranteed under section 502. The Secretary shall 
ensure that each loan guarantee made under that section contains terms 
and conditions that provide that--

a guarantee shall make available to the Secretary all records and 
evidence necessary to prosecute the civil action. The Secretary may 
accept property in full or partial satisfaction of any sums owed as a 
result of a default. If the Secretary receives, through the sale or

             Subtitle C--Comprehensive One-Call Notification

SEC. 7301. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 49 USC 6101 note.>> 

    Congress finds that--
            (1) unintentional damage to underground facilities during 
        excavation is a significant cause of disruptions in 
        telecommunications, water supply, electric power, and other 
        vital public services, such as hospital and air traffic control 
        operations, and is a leading cause of natural gas and hazardous 
        liquid pipeline accidents;

[[Page 112 STAT. 478]]

            (2) excavation that is performed without prior notification 
        to an underground facility operator or with inaccurate or 
        untimely marking of such a facility prior to excavation can 
        cause damage that results in fatalities, serious injuries, harm 
        to the environment and disruption of vital services to the 
        public; and
            (3) protection of the public and the environment from the 
        consequences of underground facility damage caused by 
        excavations will be enhanced by a coordinated national effort to 
        improve one-call notification programs in each State and the 
        effectiveness and efficiency of one-call notification systems 
        that operate under such programs.

SEC. 7302. ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION PROGRAMS.

        excavators of intended excavation in a specified area in order 
        to disseminate such notification to underground facility 
        operators that are members of the system so that such operators 
        can locate and mark their facilities in order to prevent damage 
        to underground facilities in the course of such excavation.
            ``(2) State one-call notification program.--The term `State 
        one-call notification program' means the State statutes,

        program; and
            ``(3) voluntary participation where the State determines 
        that a type of underground facility or an activity of a type of 
        excavator poses a de minimis risk to public safety or the 
        environment.

    ``(d) Penalties.--To the extent the State determines appropriate and 
necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter, a State one-call 
notification program shall, at a minimum, provide for--
            ``(1) administrative or civil penalties commensurate with 
        the seriousness of a violation by an excavator or facility owner 
        of a State one-call notification program;
            ``(2) increased penalties for parties that repeatedly damage 
        underground facilities because they fail to use one-call 
        notification systems or for parties that repeatedly fail to 
        provide timely and accurate marking after the required call has 
        been made to a one-call notification system;
            ``(3) reduced or waived penalties for a violation of a 
        requirement of a State one-call notification program that 
        results in, or could result in, damage that is promptly reported

        the Secretary may consult with the State as to whether an 
        existing State one-call notification program, a specific 
        modification thereof, or a proposed State program would result 
        in a positive determination under paragraph (2).
            ``(4) The Secretary shall prescribe the form and manner of 
        filing an application under this section that shall provide

        available to the public.

    ``(c) Alternative Program.--A State is eligible to receive a grant 
under section 6106 if the State maintains an alternative one-call 
notification program that provides protection for public safety, 
excavators, and the environment that is equivalent to, or greater than, 
protection provided under a program that meets the minimum standards set 
forth in section 6103.
    ``(d) Report.--Within 3 years after the date of the enactment of 
this chapter, the Secretary shall begin to include the following 
information in reports submitted under section 60124 of this title--
            ``(1) a description of the extent to which each State has 
        adopted and implemented the minimum Federal standards under

other interested parties, shall undertake a study of damage prevention 
practices associated with existing one-call notification systems.
    ``(b) Purpose of Study of Damage Prevention Practices.--The purpose 
of the study is to gather information in order to determine which 
existing one-call notification systems practices appear to be the most 
effective in protecting the public, excavators, and the environment and 
in preventing disruptions to public services and damage to underground 
facilities. As part of the study, the Secretary shall consider, at a 
minimum--
            ``(1) the methods used by one-call notification systems and 
        others to encourage participation by excavators and owners of 
        underground facilities;

        promote awareness of their programs, including use of public 
        service announcements and educational materials and programs;
            ``(3) the methods by which one-call notification systems 
        receive and distribute information from excavators and 
        underground facility owners;
            ``(4) the use of any performance and service standards to 
        verify the effectiveness of a one-call notification system;
            ``(5) the effectiveness and accuracy of mapping used by one-
        call notification systems;
            ``(6) the relationship between one-call notification systems 
        and preventing damage to underground facilities;
            ``(7) how one-call notification systems address the need for 
        rapid response to situations where the need to excavate is 
        urgent;
            ``(8) the extent to which accidents occur due to errors in 
        marking of underground facilities, untimely marking or errors in 
        the excavation process after a one-call notification system has 
        been notified of an excavation;
            ``(9) the extent to which personnel engaged in marking 
        underground facilities may be endangered;
            ``(10) the characteristics of damage prevention programs the 
        Secretary believes could be relevant to the effectiveness of 
        State one-call notification programs; and
            ``(11) the effectiveness of penalties and enforcement 
        activities under State one-call notification programs in 
        obtaining compliance with program requirements.
