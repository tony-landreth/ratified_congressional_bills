        case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier 
        as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area 
        designated under this paragraph, so long as each additional 
        requesting

additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a 
rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the designation
