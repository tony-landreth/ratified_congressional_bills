    (a) In General.--The Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall develop 
and implement a plan to reorganize the Internal Revenue Service. The

            (1) supersede any organization or reorganization of the 
        Internal Revenue Service based on any statute or reorganization 
        plan applicable on the effective date of this section;

        of ex parte communications between appeals officers and other

        gave rise to such action. The venue of any such action shall be 
        the same as under existing law.

    (e) Effect on Internal Revenue Service Employment 
Levels.--

        Service may redeploy or use the full-time equivalent positions

                          (vi) any expected impact on the Internal 
                      Revenue Service from the provision (including the

SEC. 5003. CLARIFICATION OF DESIGNATION OF NORMAL TRADE 
            RELATIONS.

     <<NOTE: 19 USC 2481 note.>> (a) Findings and Policy.--
            (1) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
                    (A) Since the 18th century, the principle of 
                nondiscrimination among countries with which the United 
                States has trade relations, commonly referred to as 
                ``most-favored-nation'' treatment, has been a 
                cornerstone of United States trade policy.
                    (B) Although the principle remains firmly in place 
                as a fundamental concept in United States trade 
                relations, the term ``most-favored-nation'' is a 
                misnomer which has led to public misunderstanding.
                    (C) It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the 
                most-favored-nation principle to treat any country as 
                ``most favored''. To the contrary, the principle 
                reflects the intention to confer on a country the same 
                trade benefits that are conferred on any other country, 
                that is, the intention not to discriminate among trading 
                partners.
                    (D) The term ``normal trade relations'' is a more 
                accurate description of the principle of 
                nondiscrimination as it applies to the tariffs 
                applicable generally to imports from United States 
                trading partners, that is, the general rates of duty set 
                forth in column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
                the United States.
            (2) Policy.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
                    (A) the language used in United States laws, 
                treaties, agreements, executive orders, directives, and 
                regulations should more clearly and accurately reflect 
                the underlying principles of United States trade policy; 
                and
                    (B) accordingly, the term ``normal trade relations'' 
                should, where appropriate, be substituted for the term 
                ``most-favored-nation''.

    (b) Change in Terminology.--
            (1) Trade expansion act of 1962.--The heading for section 
        251 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1881) is 
        amended to read as follows: ``normal trade relations''.
            (2) Trade act of 1974.--(A) Section 402 of the Trade Act of 
        1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432) is amended by striking ``(most-favored-
        nation treatment)'' each place it appears and inserting 
        ``(normal trade relations)''.
            (B) Section 601(9) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 
        2481(9)) is amended by striking ``most-favored-nation 
        treatment'' and inserting ``trade treatment based on normal 
        trade relations (known under international law as most-favored-
        nation treatment)''.
            (3) CFTA.--Section 302(a)(3)(C) of the United States Canada 
        Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2112 
        note) is amended by striking ``the most-favored-

[[Page 112 STAT. 790]]

        nation rate of duty'' each place it appears and inserting ``the 
        general subcolumn of the column 1 rate of duty set forth in the 
        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States''.
            (4) NAFTA.--Section 202(n) of the North American Free Trade 
        Agreement Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(n)) is amended by 
        striking ``most-favored-nation''.
            (5) Uruguay round agreements act.--Section 135(a)(2) of the 
        Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3555(a)(2)) is amended 
        by striking ``most-favored-nation'' and inserting ``normal trade 
        relations''.
            (6) SEED act.--Section 2(c)(11) of the Support for East 
        European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5401(c)(11)) is 
        amended--
                    (A) by striking ``(commonly referred to as `most 
                favored nation status')''; and
                    (B) by striking ``Most favored nation trade status'' 
                in the heading and inserting ``Normal trade relations''.
            (7) United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.--Section 
        103(4) of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 
        U.S.C. 5713(4)) is amended by striking ``(commonly referred to 
        as `most-favored-nation status')''.

     <<NOTE: 19 USC 2481 note.>> (c) Savings Provisions.--Nothing in 
this section shall affect the meaning of any provision of law, Executive 
order, Presidential proclamation, rule, regulation, delegation of 
authority, other document, or treaty or other international agreement of 
the United States relating to the principle of ``most-favored-nation'' 
(or ``most favored nation'') treatment. Any Executive order, 
Presidential proclamation, rule, regulation, delegation of authority, 
other document, or treaty or other international agreement of the United 
States that has been issued, made, granted, or allowed to become 
effective and that is in effect on the effective date of this Act, or 
was to become effective on or after the effective date of this Act, 
shall continue in effect according to its terms until modified, 
terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked in accordance with law.

stapled entity) as the activities and gross income of the exempt REIT in 
the same manner as if the exempt REIT and such group were one entity.

section--
            (1) In general.--The term ``nonqualified real property 
        interest'' means, with respect to any exempt REIT, any interest

                agreement (including a put option, buy-sell agreement, 
                and an agreement relating to a third party default)

                thereafter on such REIT or stapled entity; or
                    (B) the acquisition is described on or before such

                      the exempt REIT or any member of the stapled REIT 
                      group; and
                          (ii) any repair to, or improvement of, any 
                      improvement owned or leased by the exempt REIT or 
                      any member of the stapled REIT group,
                if such ownership or leasehold interest is a qualified 
                real property interest.
                    (B) Leases.--The term ``nonqualified real property 
                interest'' shall not include--
                          (i) any lease of a qualified real property

                      interest; or
                          (ii) any renewal of a lease which is a 
                      qualified real property interest,
                but only if the rent on any lease referred to in clause 
                (i) or any renewal referred to in clause (ii) does not 
                exceed an arm's length rate.

                          (i) In general.--Subparagraph (A) shall not

                      the use of the property to which such improvement 
                      relates unless the cost of such improvement does 
                      not exceed 200 percent of--
                                    (I) the cost of such property; or
                                    (II) if such property is substituted 
                                basis property (as defined in section

            (4) Exception for permitted transfers, etc.--The term 
        ``nonqualified real property interest'' shall not include any 
        interest in real property acquired solely as a result of a 
        direct or indirect contribution, distribution, or other transfer 
        of such interest from the exempt REIT or any member of the 
        stapled REIT group to such REIT or any such member, but only to 
        the extent the aggregate of the interests of the exempt REIT and 
        all stapled entities in such interest in real property 
        (determined in accordance with subsection (c)(1)) is not 
        increased by reason of the transfer.

        or any stapled entity with respect to such REIT (or treated 
        under subsection (c) as held by such REIT or stapled entity) 
        shall be treated as nonqualified real property interests 
        unless--
                    (A) such stapled entity was a stapled entity with 
                respect to such REIT as of March 26, 1998, and at all 
                times thereafter; and
                    (B) as of March 26, 1998, and at all times 
                thereafter, such REIT was a real estate investment

        interest in real property held by any 10-percent subsidiary 
        entity of the exempt REIT or stapled entity, as the case may be.
            (2) Property held by 10-percent subsidiaries treated as 
        nonqualified.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), any interest in real property held by a 10-percent 
                subsidiary entity of an exempt REIT or stapled entity 
                shall be treated as a nonqualified real property 
                interest.

                march 26, 1998, etc.--In the case of an entity which was 
                a 10-percent subsidiary entity of an exempt REIT or 
                stapled entity on March 26, 1998, and at all times 
                thereafter, an interest in real property held by such 
                subsidiary entity shall be treated as a qualified real 
                property interest if such interest would be so treated 
                if held or acquired directly by the exempt REIT or the 
                stapled entity.
            (3) Reduction in qualified real property interests if 
        increase in ownership of subsidiary.--If, after March 26, 1998, 
        an exempt REIT or stapled entity increases its ownership 
        interest in a subsidiary entity to which paragraph (2)(B) 
        applies above its ownership interest in such subsidiary entity 
        as of such date, the additional portion of each interest in real 
        property which is treated as held by the exempt REIT or stapled 
        entity by reason of such increased ownership shall be treated as 
        a nonqualified real property interest.
            (4) Special rules for determining ownership.--For 
        purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) percentage ownership of an entity shall be 
                determined in accordance with subsection (e)(4);
                    (B) interests in the entity which are acquired by an 
                exempt REIT or a member of the stapled REIT group in any 
                acquisition described in an agreement, announcement, or 
                filing described in subsection (b)(2) shall be treated 
                as acquired on March 26, 1998; and
                    (C) except as provided in guidance prescribed by the 
                Secretary, any change in proportionate ownership which 
                is attributable solely to fluctuations in the relative 
                fair

[[Page 112 STAT. 830]]

                market values of different classes of stock shall not be 
                taken into account.
            (5) Treatment of 60-percent partnerships.--
                    (A) In general.--If, as of March 26, 1998--
                          (i) an exempt REIT or stapled entity held 
                      directly or indirectly at least 60 percent of the 
                      capital or profits interest in a partnership; and
                          (ii) 90 percent or more of the capital 
                      interests and 90 percent or more of the profits 
                      interests in such partnership (other than 
                      interests held directly or indirectly by the 
                      exempt REIT or stapled entity) are, or will be, 
                      redeemable or exchangeable for consideration the 
                      amount of which is determined by reference to the 
                      value of shares of stock in the exempt REIT or 
                      stapled entity (or both),
                paragraph (3) shall not apply to such partnership, and 
                such REIT or entity shall be treated for all purposes of 
                this section as holding all of the capital and profits 
                interests in such partnership.
                    (B) Limitation to one partnership.--If, as of 
                January 1, 1999, more than one partnership owned by any 
                exempt REIT or stapled entity meets the requirements of 
                subparagraph (A), only the largest such partnership on 
                such date (determined by aggregate asset bases) shall be 
                treated as meeting such requirements.
                    (C) Mirror entity.--For purposes of subparagraph 
                (A), an interest in a partnership formed after March 26,

                stapled entity on March 26, 1998, if such partnership is 
                formed to mirror the stapling of an exempt REIT and a 
                stapled entity in connection with an acquisition agreed 
                to or announced on or before March 26, 1998.

    (d) Treatment of Property Secured by Mortgage Held by Exempt REIT or 
Member of Stapled REIT Group.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of any nonqualified obligation 
        held by an exempt REIT or any member of the stapled REIT group, 
        the REIT gross income provisions shall be applied by treating 
        the exempt REIT as having impermissible tenant 
        service income equal to--
                    (A) the interest income from such obligation which 
                is properly allocable to the property described in 
                paragraph (2); and
                    (B) the income of any member of the stapled REIT 
                group from services described in paragraph (2) with 
                respect to such property.
        If the income referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) is of a 10-
        percent subsidiary entity, only the portion of such income which 
        is properly allocable to the exempt REIT's or the stapled 
        entity's interest in the subsidiary entity shall be taken into 
        account.
            (2) Nonqualified obligation.--Except as otherwise provided 
        in this subsection, the term ``nonqualified obligation'' means 
        any obligation secured by a mortgage on an interest in real 
        property if the income of any member of the stapled REIT group 
        for services furnished with respect to such property

[[Page 112 STAT. 831]]

        would be impermissible tenant service income were such property 
        held by the exempt REIT and such services furnished by the 
        exempt REIT.
            (3) Exception for certain market rate obligations.--Such 
        term shall not include any obligation--
                    (A) payments under which would be treated as
