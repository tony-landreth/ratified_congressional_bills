SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Strom 
Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina first became a 
        member of the Committee on Armed Services of the United States 
        Senate on January 19, 1959. Senator Thurmond's continuous 
        service on that committee covers more than 75 percent of the 
        period of the existence of the committee, which was established 
        immediately after World War II, and more than 20 percent of the 
        period of the existence of military and naval affairs committees 
        of Congress, the original bodies of which were formed in 1816.
            (2) Senator Thurmond came to Congress and the committee as a 
        distinguished veteran of service, including combat service, in 
        the Armed Forces of the United States.
            (3) Senator Thurmond was commissioned as a reserve second 
        lieutenant of infantry in 1924. He served with great distinction 
        with the First Army in the European Theater of Operations during 
        World War II, landing in Normandy in a glider with the 82nd 
        Airborne Division on D-Day. He was transferred to the Pacific 
        Theater of Operations at the end of the war in Europe and was 
        serving in the Philippines when Japan surrendered.
            (4) Having reverted to Reserve status at the end of World 
        War II, Senator Thurmond was promoted to brigadier general in 
        the United States Army Reserve in 1954. He served as President 
        of the Reserve Officers Association beginning that same year and 
        ending in 1955. Senator Thurmond was promoted to major general 
        in the United States Army Reserve in 1959. He transferred to the 
        Retired Reserve on January 1, 1965, after 36 years of 
        commissioned service.
            (5) The distinguished character of Senator Thurmond's 
        military service has been recognized by awards of numerous 
        decorations that include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star 
        medal with ``V'' device, the Army Commendation Medal, the 
        Belgian

[[Page 112 STAT. 1921]]

        Cross of the Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre.
            (6) Senator Thurmond has served as chairman of the Committee 
        on Armed Services of the United States Senate since 1995 and 
        served as the ranking minority member of the committee from 1993 
        to 1995. Senator Thurmond concludes his service as chairman at 
        the end of the One Hundred Fifth Congress, but is to continue to 
        serve the committee as a member in successive Congresses.
            (7) This Act is the fortieth annual authorization bill for 
        the Department of Defense for which Senator Thurmond has taken a 
        major responsibility as a member of the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the Senate.
            (8) Senator Thurmond, as an Army officer and a legislator, 
        has made matchless contributions to the national security of the 
        United States that, in duration and in quality, are unique.
            (9) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the 
        last annual authorization Act for the national defense that 
        Senator Thurmond manages in and for the United States Senate as 
        chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his 
        honor, as provided in subsection (a).

the authorization of payment of settlement with Canada in subsection (b) 
regarding environmental cleanup at formerly used defense sites in 
Canada:
            (1) A unique and longstanding national security alliance 
        exists between the United States and Canada.

        by the United States and Canada for their mutual defense.
            (3) There is no formal treaty or international agreement 
        between the United States and Canada regarding the environmental 
        cleanup of the sites.
            (4) Environmental contamination at some of the sites could

            (6) There is a unique factual basis for authorizing a 
        reimbursement of Canada for environmental cleanup at sites in 
        Canada after the United States departure from such sites.
            (7) The basis for and authorization of such reimbursement 
        does not extend to similar claims by other nations.

        entire $100,000,000 of the reimbursement authorized in 
        subsection (b) in the United States, which will benefit United 
        States industry and United States workers.

Secretary of Defense may, using funds specified under subsection (d), 
make a payment described in paragraph (2) for each fiscal year through

Military Sales Trust Account for purposes of Canada.
    (c) Condition on Authority for Subsequent Fiscal Years.--A payment

1999 only if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress with the 
budget for such fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31, United 
States Code, evidence that the cumulative amount expended by the 
Government of Canada for environmental cleanup activities in Canada 
during any fiscal years before such fiscal year in which a payment under 
that subsection was authorized was an amount equal to or greater than 
the aggregate amount of the payments under that subsection during such 
fiscal years.
    (d) Source of Funds.--(1) The payment under subsection (b) for 
fiscal year 1998 shall be made from amounts appropriated pursuant to 
section 301(5) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
1998 (Public Law 105-85; 111 Stat. 1669).

SEC. 328. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING OIL SPILL PREVENTION TRAINING FOR 
            PERSONNEL ON BOARD NAVY VESSELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There have been six significant oil spills in Puget 
        Sound, Washington, in 1998, five at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 
        (including three from the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk, one from the U.S.S. 
        Carl Vinson, and one from the U.S.S. Sacramento) and one at 
        Naval Station Everett from the U.S.S. Paul F. Foster.
            (2) Navy personnel on board vessels, and not shipyard 
        employees, were primarily responsible for a majority of these 
        oil spills at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

[[Page 112 STAT. 1967]]

            (3) Oil spills have the potential to damage the local 
        environment, killing microscopic organisms, contributing to air 
        pollution, harming plants and marine animals, and increasing 
        overall pollution levels in Puget Sound.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Navy should take immediate action to significantly 
reduce the risk of vessel oil spills, including the minimization of fuel 
oil transfers, the assurance of proper training and qualifications of 
all Naval personnel in occupations that may contribute to or minimize 
the risk of shipboard oil spills, and the improvement of liaison with 
local authorities concerning oil spill prevention and response 
activities.

SEC. 345. CONTRACTOR-OPERATED CIVIL ENGINEERING SUPPLY STORES PROGRAM.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``contractor-operated civil engineering supply 
        store'' means a Government-owned facility that, as of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, is operated by a contractor under 
        the contractor-operated civil engineering supply store program 
        of the Department of the Air Force (known as the ``COCESS 
        program'') for the purpose of--
                    (A) maintaining inventories of civil engineering 
                supplies on behalf of a military department; and
                    (B) furnishing such supplies to the department as 
                needed.
            (2) The term ``civil engineering supplies'' means parts and 
        supplies needed for the repair and maintenance of military 
        installations.

    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1970, the Strategic Air Command of the Air Force 
        began to use contractor-operated civil engineering supply stores 
        to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of materials 
        management and relieve the Air Force from having to maintain 
        large inventories of civil engineering supplies.
            (2) Contractor-operated civil engineering supply stores are 
        designed to support the civil engineering and public works 
        efforts of the Armed Forces through the provision of quality 
        civil engineering supplies at competitive prices and within a 
        reasonable period of time.
            (3) Through the use of a contractor-operated civil 
        engineering supply store, a guaranteed inventory level of civil 
        engineering supplies is maintained at a military installation, 
        which ensures that urgently needed civil engineering supplies 
        are available on site.

[[Page 112 STAT. 1979]]

            (4) The contractor operating the contractor-operated civil 
        engineering supply store is an independent business organization 
        whose customer is a military department and the Armed Forces and 
        who is subject to all the rules of private business and the 
        regulations of the Government.
            (5) The use of contractor-operated civil engineering supply 
        stores ensures the best price and best buy for the Government.
            (6) Ninety-five percent of the cost savings realized through 
        the use of contractor-operated civil engineering supply stores 
        is due to savings in the cost of actually procuring supplies.
            (7) In the past 30 years, private contractors have never 
        lost a cost comparison conducted pursuant to the criteria set 
        forth in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 for the 
        provision of civil engineering supplies to the Government.

    (c) Conditions on Multi-Function Contracts.--A civil engineering 
supplies function that is performed, as of the date of the enactment of 
this Act, by a contractor-operated civil engineering supply store may 
not be combined with another supply function or any service function, 
including any base operating support function, for purposes of 
competition or contracting, until 60 days after the date on which the 
Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a report--
            (1) notifying Congress of the proposed combined competition 
        or contract; and
            (2) explaining why a combined competition or contract is the 
        best method by which to achieve cost savings and efficiencies to 
        the Government.

    (d) GAO Reviews.--Not later than 50 days after the date on which the 
Secretary of Defense submits a report to Congress under subsection (c), 
the Comptroller General shall review the report and submit to Congress a 
briefing regarding whether the cost savings and efficiencies identified 
in the report are achievable.
    (e) Relationship to Other Laws.--If a civil engineering supplies 
function covered by subsection (c) is proposed for combination with a 
supply or service function that is subject to the study and reporting 
requirements of section 2461 of title 10, United States Code, the 
Secretary of Defense may include the report required under subsection 
(c) as part of the report under such section.

should have been considered for selection for

[[Page 112 STAT. 2001]]

promotion by a promotion board was not so considered, the Secretary 
shall convene a special selection board under this subsection to 
determine whether that person (whether or not then on active duty) 
should be recommended for promotion.'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking out ``the officer as his 
        record'' in the first sentence and inserting in lieu thereof

        this section to consider a warrant officer or former warrant

        title (rather than the provisions of section 617(b) and 618 of 
        this title) apply to the report and proceedings of the board in 
        the same manner as they apply to the report and proceedings of a

        case of a board convened under this section to consider a

        next higher grade, that person shall, as soon as practicable, be 
        appointed to the next higher grade in accordance with provisions

under any provision of chapter 36 of this title for twice failing of 
selection for promotion to the next higher grade is not entitled to

SEC. 507. <<NOTE: 10 USC 2107 note.>>  REVIEW REGARDING ALLOCATION OF 
            NAVAL RESERVE OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS SCHOLARSHIPS AMONG 
            PARTICIPATING COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

    (a) Review.--The Secretary of the Navy should review the process and 
criteria used to determine the number of Naval Reserve Officer Training 
Corps (NROTC) scholarship recipients who attend each college and 
university participating in the NROTC program and how those scholarships 
are allocated to those schools.
    (b) Purpose of Review.--The review should seek to determine--
            (1) whether the method used by the Navy to allocate NROTC 
        scholarships could be changed so as to increase the likelihood 
        that scholarship awardees attend the school of their choice 
        while maintaining the Navy's capability to attain the objectives 
        of the Naval ROTC program to meet the annual

[[Page 112 STAT. 2005]]

        requirement for newly commissioned Navy ensigns and Marine Corps 
        second lieutenants, as well as the overall needs of the officer 
        corps of the Department of the Navy; and
            (2) within the determination under paragraph (1), whether 
        the likelihood of a scholarship awardee who wants to attend a 
        school of choice in the student's State of residence can be 
        increased.

    (c) Matters Reviewed.--The matters reviewed should include the 
following:
            (1) The factors and criteria considered in the process of 
        determining the allocation of NROTC scholarships to host 
        colleges and universities.
            (2) Historical data indicating the extent to which NROTC 
        scholarship recipients attend colleges and universities they 
        have indicated a preference to attend, as opposed to attending 
        solely or mainly in order to receive an NROTC scholarship.
            (3) The extent to which the process used by the Navy to 
        allocate NROTC scholarships to participating colleges and 
        universities contributes to optimizing resources available for 
        the operation of the NROTC program and improving the 
        professional education of NROTC midshipmen.
            (4) The effects that eliminating the controlled allocation 
        of scholarships to host colleges and universities, entirely or 
        by State, would have on the NROTC program.

    (d) Consultation Requirement.--In carrying out a review under 
subsection (a), the Secretary should consult with officials of 
interested associations and of colleges and universities which host ROTC 
units and such other officials as the Secretary considers appropriate.

SEC. 533. COMMENDATION AND COMMEMORATION OF THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS 
            PERSONNEL WHO SERVED IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY ASIATIC FLEET 
            FROM 1910-1942.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States established the Asiatic Fleet of the 
        Navy in 1910 to protect United States nationals, policies, and 
        possessions in the Far East.
            (2) The sailors and Marines of the Asiatic Fleet ensured the 
        safety of United States and foreign nationals and provided 
        humanitarian assistance in that region during the Chinese civil 
        war, the Yangtze Flood of 1931, and the outbreak of Sino-
        Japanese hostilities.
            (3) In 1940, due to deteriorating political relations and 
        increasing tensions between the United States and Japan, a 
        reinforced Asiatic Fleet began concentrating on the defense of 
        the Philippines and engaged in extensive training to ensure 
        maximum operational readiness for any eventuality.
            (4) Following the declaration of war against Japan in 
        December 1941, the warships, submarines, and aircraft of the 
        Asiatic Fleet courageously fought many battles against superior 
        Japanese forces.
            (5) The Asiatic Fleet directly suffered the loss of 22 
        vessels, 1,826 men killed or missing in action, and 518 men 
        captured

[[Page 112 STAT. 2017]]

        and imprisoned under the worst of conditions, with many of them 
        dying while held as prisoners of war.

    (b) Congressional Commendation.--Congress--
            (1) commends the Navy and Marine Corps personnel who served 
        in the Asiatic Fleet of the United States Navy during the period 
        from 1910 to 1942; and
            (2) honors those who gave their lives in the line of duty 
        while serving in the Asiatic Fleet.

    (c) Commemoration of United States Navy Asiatic Fleet.--
The <<NOTE: President.>>  President is authorized and requested to issue 
a proclamation designating an appropriate commemoration of the United 
States Navy Asiatic Fleet and calling upon the people of the United 
States to observe such commemoration with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.

SEC. 534. APPRECIATION FOR SERVICE DURING WORLD WAR I AND WORLD WAR II 
            BY MEMBERS OF THE NAVY ASSIGNED ON BOARD MERCHANT SHIPS AS 
            THE NAVAL ARMED GUARD SERVICE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Navy established a special force during both World 
        War I and World War II, known as the Naval Armed Guard Service, 
        to protect merchant ships of the United States from enemy attack 
        by stationing members of the Navy and weapons on board those 
        ships.
            (2) Members of the Naval Armed Guard Service served on 6,236 
        merchant ships during World War II, of which 710 were sunk by 
        enemy action.
            (3) Over 144,900 members of the Navy served in the Naval 
        Armed Guard Service during World War II as officers, gun 
        crewmen, signalmen, and radiomen, of whom 1,810 were killed in 
        action.
            (4) The efforts of the members of the Naval Armed Guard 
        Service played a significant role in the safe passage of United 
        States merchant ships to their destinations in the Soviet Union 
        and various locations in western Europe and the Pacific Theater.
            (5) The efforts of the members of the Navy who served in the 
        Naval Armed Guard Service have been largely overlooked due to 
        the rapid disbanding of the service after World War II and lack 
        of adequate records.
            (6) Recognition of the service of the naval personnel who 
        served in the Naval Armed Guard Service is highly warranted and 
        long overdue.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress expresses its appreciation, and the 
appreciation of the American people, for the dedicated service performed 
during World War I and World War II by members of the Navy assigned as 
gun crews on board merchant ships as part of the Naval Armed Guard 
Service.

            STATES ARMED FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) South Vietnam, Australia, South Korea, Thailand, New 
        Zealand, and the Philippines contributed military forces,

[[Page 112 STAT. 2018]]

        together with the United States, during military operations 
        conducted in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict.
            (2) Indigenous groups, such as the Hmong, Nung, Montagnard, 
        Kahmer, Hoa Hao, and Cao Dai contributed military forces, 
        together with the United States, during military operations 
        conducted in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict.
            (3) The contributions of these combat forces continued 
        through long years of armed conflict.
            (4) As a result, in addition to the United States casualties 
        exceeding 210,000, this willingness to participate in the 
        Vietnam conflict resulted in the death and wounding of more than 
        1,000,000 military personnel from South Vietnam and 16,000 from 
        other allied nations.
            (5) The service of the Vietnamese, indigenous groups, and 
        other allied nations was repeatedly marked by exceptional 
        heroism and sacrifice, with particularly noteworthy 
        contributions being made by the Vietnamese airborne, commando, 
        infantry and ranger units, the Republic of Korea marines, the 
        Capital and White Horse divisions, the Royal Thai Army Black 
        Panther Division, the Royal Australian Regiment, the New Zealand 
        ``V'' force, and the 1st Philippine Civic Action Group.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress recognizes and honors the members 
and former members of the military forces of South Vietnam, the Republic 
of Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, as well 
as members of the Hmong, Nung, Montagnard, Kahmer, Hoa Hao, and Cao Dai, 
for their heroism, sacrifice, and service in connection with United 
States Armed Forces during the Vietnam conflict.

SEC. 536. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE HEROISM, SACRIFICE, AND 
            SERVICE OF FORMER SOUTH VIETNAMESE COMMANDOS IN CONNECTION 
            WITH UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) South Vietnamese commandos were recruited by the United 
        States as part of OPLAN 34A or its predecessor or OPLAN 35 from 
        1961 to 1970.
            (2) The commandos conducted covert operations in North 
        Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict.
            (3) Many of the commandos were captured and imprisoned by 
        North Vietnamese forces, some for as long as 20 years.
            (4) The commandos served and fought proudly during the 
        Vietnam conflict.
            (5) Many of the commandos lost their lives serving in 
        operations conducted by the United States during the Vietnam 
        conflict.
            (6) Many of the Vietnamese commandos now reside in the 
        United States.

    (b) Sense of Congress--Congress recognizes and honors the former 
South Vietnamese commandos for their heroism, sacrifice, and service in 
connection with United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam conflict.

[[Page 112 STAT. 2024]]

            (1) A description of the basis for the selection of

        that many of the prisoners transferred are minimum or medium 
        security prisoners, who are considered to have the best chance 
        for rehabilitation, and whether the transfer of those prisoners 
        indicates a change in Department of Defense policy regarding the 
        rehabilitation of military prisoners.

        prisoners released from the United States Disciplinary Barracks

                of the election if the person had elected to participate 
                in the Survivor Benefit Plan (for the same base amount 
                specified in the election) at the first opportunity that 
                was afforded the member to participate under chapter 73 
                of title 10, United States Code;
                    (B) interest on the amounts by which the retired pay

                methodology as the Secretary of Defense determines

                of the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund

                associated with the election.

        paid under the regulations shall be credited to the Department

SEC. 741. <<NOTE: 10 USC 1109 note.>>  ENHANCED DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
            ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Organ and tissue transplantation is one of the most 
        remarkable medical success stories in the history of medicine.
            (2) Each year, the number of people waiting for organ or 
        tissue transplantation increases. It is estimated that there are 
        approximately 39,000 patients, ranging in age from babies to 
        those in retirement, awaiting transplants of kidneys, hearts, 
        livers, and other solid organs.
            (3) The Department of Defense has made significant progress 
        in increasing the awareness of the importance of organ and 
        tissue donations among members of the Armed Forces.
            (4) The inclusion of organ and tissue donor elections in the 
        Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) central 
        database represents a major step in ensuring that organ and 
        tissue donor elections are a matter of record and are accessible 
        in a timely manner.

    (b) Responsibilities Regarding Organ and Tissue Donation.--(1) 
Chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding after

                          ``(i) after completion by the recruit of basic 
                      training; and

                      first duty assignment of the recruit;
            ``(2) members of the armed forces are given recurring, 
        specific opportunities to elect to be organ or tissue donors 
        during service in the armed forces and upon retirement; and
            ``(3) members of the armed forces electing to be organ or 
        tissue donors are encouraged to advise their next of kin 
        concerning the donation decision and any subsequent change of 
        that decision.

    ``(c) Responsibilities of the Surgeons General of the 
Military Departments.--The Surgeons General of the military departments 
shall ensure that--
            ``(1) appropriate training is provided to enlisted and 
        officer medical personnel to facilitate the effective operation

SEC. 744. REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ENROLLMENT-BASED CAPITATION FOR 
            FUNDING FOR MILITARY MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES.

    (a) Report Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report on the potential impact of using an enrollment-based 
capitation methodology to allocate funds for military medical treatment 
facilities. The report shall address the following:
            (1) A description of the plans of the Secretary to implement 
        an enrollment-based capitation methodology for military medical 
        treatment facilities and with respect to contracts for the 
        delivery of health care under the TRICARE program.
            (2) The justifications for implementing an enrollment-based 
        capitation methodology without first conducting a demonstration 
        project for implementation of such methodology.
            (3) The impact that implementation of an enrollment-based 
        capitation methodology would have on the provision of space-
        available care at military medical treatment facilities, 
        particularly in the case of care for--
                    (A) military retirees who are entitled to hospital 
                insurance benefits under part A of title XVIII of the 
                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.); and
                    (B) covered beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 
                10, United States Code, who reside outside the catchment 
                area of a military medical treatment facility.
            (4) The impact that implementation of an enrollment-based 
        capitation methodology would have with respect to the pharmacy 
        benefits provided at military medical treatment facilities, 
        given that the enrollment-based capitation methodology would 
        fund military medical treatment facilities based on the number 
        of members at such facilities enrolled in TRICARE Prime, but all 
        covered beneficiaries may fill prescriptions at military medical 
        treatment facility pharmacies.
            (5) An explanation of how additional funding will be 
        provided for a military medical treatment facility if an 
        enrollment-based capitation methodology is implemented to ensure 
        that space-available care and pharmacy coverage can be provided 
        to covered beneficiaries who are not enrolled at the military 
        medical treatment facility, and the amount of funding that will 
        be available.
            (6) An explanation of how implementation of an enrollment-
        based capitation methodology would impact the provision of 
        uniform benefits under TRICARE Prime, and how the Secretary 
        would ensure, if such methodology were implemented, that the 
        provision of health care under TRICARE Prime would not be 
        bifurcated between the provision of such care at military 
        medical treatment facilities and the provision of such care from 
        civilian providers.

    (b) Deadline for Submission.--The Secretary shall submit the report 
required by subsection (a) not later than March 1, 1999.

        Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the

[[Page 112 STAT. 2076]]

        Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that 
        collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and 
        health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more 
        than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.
            (2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a 
        profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.
            (3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of 
        military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the 
        number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.
            (4) During the 2 years since 1996, the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by decentralizing 
        authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks.
            (5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, 
        increased demands for health care services, and increasing 
        budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of 
        dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from shared 
        services to joint venture operations of medical facilities.
            (6) In 1984, there was a combined total of 102 Department of 
        Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense facilities with 
        sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. 
        During the six years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 
        1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 
        services to more than 6,000 services, ranging from major medical 
        and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory services 
        to unusual speciality care services.
            (7) The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs are conducting four health care joint ventures in New 
        Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Oklahoma, and are planning to conduct 
        four more such ventures in Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, and 
        California.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs should be commended for the cooperation between the two 
        departments in the delivery of medical care, of which the 
        cooperation involved in the establishment and operation of the 
        Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        Executive Council is a praiseworthy example;
            (2) the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs are encouraged to continue to explore new opportunities 
        to enhance the availability and delivery of medical care to

        the departments; and
            (3) enhanced cooperation between the Department of Defense 
        and the Department of Veterans Affairs is encouraged regarding--
                    (A) the general areas of access to quality medical 
                care, identification and elimination of impediments to

                    (B) the specific areas in which there is significant 
                potential to achieve progress in cooperation in a short 
                term, including computerization of patient records 
                systems, participation of the Department of Veterans 
                Affairs in the

        Department of Veterans Affairs treatment facilities or through 
        other federally funded medical programs, choose not to seek 
        medical care from those facilities or under those programs, and 
        the reasons for that choice.
            (D) The obstacles or disincentives for seeking medical care 
        from such facilities or under such programs that are perceived 
        by veterans, retirees, and dependents.

        other department without diminution of access or services to 
        their primary beneficiaries.
            (F) The extent to which the recruitment of scarce medical 
        specialists and allied health personnel by the Department of 
        Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs could be enhanced

        services.

SEC. 903. INDEPENDENT TASK FORCE ON TRANSFORMATION AND DEPARTMENT OF 
            DEFENSE ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:

[[Page 112 STAT. 2092]]

            (1) The post-Cold War era is marked by geopolitical 
        uncertainty and by accelerating technological change, 
        particularly with regard to information technologies.
            (2) The combination of that geopolitical uncertainty and 
        accelerating technological change portends a transformation in 
        the conduct of war, particularly in ways that are likely to 
        increase the effectiveness of joint operations.
            (3) The Department of Defense must be organized 
        appropriately in order to fully exploit the opportunities 
        offered by, and to meet the challenges posed by, this 
        anticipated transformation in the conduct of war.
            (4) The basic organization of the Department of Defense was 
        established by the National Security Act of 1947 and the 1949 
        amendments to that Act.
            (5) The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense 
        Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-433) dramatically 
        improved the capability of the Department of Defense to carry 
        out operations involving joint forces, but did not specifically 
        address issues pertaining to the development of joint 
        operations.
            (6) In the future, the ability to achieve improved 
        operations of joint forces, particularly under rapidly changing 
        technological conditions, will depend on improved force 
        development for joint operations.

     <<NOTE: Establishment.>> (b) Independent Task Force on 
Transformation and Department of Defense Organization.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall establish a task force of the Defense Science Board to 
examine the current organization of the Department of Defense with 
regard to the appropriateness of that organization for preparing for a 
transformation in the conduct of war. <<NOTE: Deadline.>>  The task 
force shall be established not later than November 1, 1998.

    (c) Duties of the Task Force.--The task force shall assess, and 
shall make recommendations for the appropriate organization of, the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the

        Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the 
        individual Armed Forces.
            (2) The joint requirements process and the requirements 
        processes for each of the Armed Forces, including the 
        establishment of measures of effectiveness and methods for

            (3) The process and organizations responsible for doctrinal 
        development, including the appropriate relationship between 
        joint force and service doctrine and doctrinal development 
        organizations.
            (4) The current programs and organizations under the Office 
        of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the 
        Armed Forces devoted to innovation and experimentation related 
        to a transformation in the conduct of war, including the 
        appropriateness of--

[[Page 112 STAT. 2093]]

                    (A) conducting joint field tests;
                    (B) establishing a separate unified command as a

                measures of effectiveness, analytical concepts, models, 
                and simulations appropriate for understanding the 
                transformation in the conduct of war;
                    (D) establishing a Joint Battle Laboratory to 
                conduct joint experimentation and to integrate the 
                similar efforts of the Armed Forces; and

        Secretary considers appropriate.

    (c) Market Research.--In carrying out the study, the Secretary shall 
conduct market research to determine whether or not an efficient and 
competitive domestic market for finance and accounting services exists. 
In conducting that research, the Secretary shall consider whether the 
domestic market for finance and accounting services could be reasonably 
expected to generate responsive private sector competitors for the 
provision of the finance and accounting services, or a portion of such 
services, of the Department of Defense and whether there are any 
substantial barriers to entry or expansion in that market. In conducting 
such research, the Secretary shall consider not only the current state 
of the domestic market for finance and accounting services, but also the 
potential effects that the entry of the Department of Defense as a 
large, long-term consumer of such services might have on that market.

              Subtitle C--Joint Warfighting Experimentation

SEC. 921. <<NOTE: 10 USC 485 note.>>  FINDINGS CONCERNING JOINT 
            WARFIGHTING EXPERIMENTATION.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The assessments of the Quadrennial Defense Review and 
        the National Defense Panel provide a compelling argument--
                    (A) that the security environment in the early 21st 
                century will include fundamentally different military 
                challenges than the security environment in the late 
                20th century; and
                    (B) reinforce the premise of the Goldwater-Nichols 
                Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 that 
                future warfare will require more effective joint 
                operational concepts.
            (2) Joint experimentation is necessary for--
                    (A) integrating advances in technology with changes 
                in organizational structure and joint operational 
                concepts; and
                    (B) determining the interdependent aspects of joint 
                warfare that are key for transforming the conduct of 
                military operations to meet future challenges 
                successfully.
            (3) It is essential that an energetic and innovative 
        organization be established in the Department of Defense with 
        the authority (subject to the authority and guidance of the 
        Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) 
        to design and implement a process of joint experimentation to 
        investigate and test technologies and alternative forces and 
        concepts in field environments under realistic conditions

[[Page 112 STAT. 2103]]

        against the full range of future challenges to assist in 
        developing and validating new joint warfighting concepts and 
        transforming the Armed Forces to meet the threats to national 
        security anticipated for the early 21st century.

SEC. 922. <<NOTE: 10 USC 485 note.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING JOINT 
            WARFIGHTING EXPERIMENTATION.

    (a) Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting 
Experimentation Mission.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
initiative of the Secretary of Defense to designate the commander of a 
combatant command to have the mission of joint warfighting 
experimentation is a key step in exploiting the potential of advanced 
technologies, new organizational structures, and new joint operational 
concepts to transform the conduct of military operations by the Armed 
Forces.
    (b) Resources and Authority of Commander.--It is, further, the sense 
of Congress that the commander of the combatant command referred to in 
subsection (a) should be provided with appropriate and sufficient 
resources for joint warfighting experimentation and with the appropriate 
authority to execute the commander's assigned responsibilities and that 
such authority should include the following:
            (1) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of joint 
        warfighting experimentation, which program should include 
        analyses, simulations, wargames, experiments, advanced concept 
        technology demonstrations, joint exercises conducted in virtual 
        and field environments, and, as a particularly critical aspect, 
        assessments of ``red team'' vulnerability.
            (2) Developing scenarios and measures of effectiveness to 
        meet the operational challenges expected to be encountered in 
        the early 21st century and assessing the effectiveness of 
        current and new organizational structures, operational concepts, 
        and technologies in addressing those challenges.
            (3) Integrating and testing in joint experimentation the 
        systems and concepts that result from warfighting 
        experimentation conducted by the Armed Forces and the Defense 
        Agencies.
            (4) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and Defense 
        Agencies regarding the development and acquisition of equipment 
        (including surrogate or real technologies, platforms, and 
        systems), supplies, and services necessary for joint 
        experimentation.
            (5) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of 
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff with recommendations, based on the 
        conduct of joint warfighting experimentation, for--
                    (A) improving interoperability;
                    (B) reducing unnecessary redundancy;
                    (C) synchronizing technology fielding;
                    (D) developing joint operational concepts;
                    (E) prioritizing the most promising joint 
                capabilities for future experimentation; and
                    (F) prioritizing joint requirements and acquisition

            (6) Making recommendations to the Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff on mission needs statements and operational 
        requirements documents.

[[Page 112 STAT. 2104]]

    (c) Congressional Review.--It is, further, the sense of Congress 
that Congress--
            (1) should review the adequacy of the process of 
        transformation to meet future challenges to the national 
        security; and
            (2) if progress is determined inadequate, should consider 
        legislation to--
                    (A) establish an appropriate organization to conduct 
                the mission described in subsection (a); and
                    (B) provide to the commander given the 
                responsibility for that mission appropriate and 
                sufficient resources for joint warfighting 
                experimentation and the appropriate authority to execute 
                that commander's assigned responsibilities for that 
                mission, including the authorities specified in 
                subsection (b).

SEC. 923. <<NOTE: 10 USC 485 note.>> REPORTS ON JOINT WARFIGHTING 
            EXPERIMENTATION.

    (a) Initial Report.--(1) The commander of the combatant command 
assigned by the Secretary of Defense to have the mission for joint 
warfighting experimentation shall submit to the Secretary an initial 
report on the implementation of joint experimentation.

submit that report, together with any comments that the Secretary 
considers appropriate and any comments that the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff considers appropriate, to the Committee on Armed 
Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the 
House of Representatives.

    (2) The report of the commander under paragraph (1) shall include 
the commander's assessment of the following:

evaluating the following:
            (1) The feasibility of tagging hydrocarbon fuels used by the 
        Department of Defense for the purposes of analyzing and 
        identifying such fuels.
            (2) The deterrent effect of such tagging on the theft and 
        misuse of fuels purchased by the Department.
            (3) The extent to which such tagging would assist in 
        determining the source of surface and underground pollution in

by the Secretary satisfies the following requirements:
            (1) The tagging system would not harm the environment.

                the introduction of additives into hydrocarbon fuels.
            (3) The tagging system would permit a determination if a tag 
        is present and a determination if the concentration of a tag has 
        changed in order to facilitate identification of tagged fuels 
        and detection of dilution of tagged fuels.
            (4) The tagging system would not impair or degrade the 
        suitability of tagged fuels for their intended use.

    (c) Recommendations.--The report shall include any recommendations 
for legislation relating to the tagging of hydrocarbon fuels by the 
Department of Defense that the Secretary considers appropriate.

    Subtitle A--United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina

SEC. 1201. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The contributions of the people of the United States and 
        other nations have, in large measure, resulted in the suspension 
        of fighting and alleviated the suffering of the people of Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina since December 1995.
            (2) The United States has expended approximately 
        $9,500,000,000 between 1992 and mid-1998 just in support

[[Page 112 STAT. 2146]]

        of the United States military operations in Bosnia to achieve 
        those results.
            (3) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure 
        in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved some success in 
        accordance with the Dayton Accords.
            (4) On March 3, 1998, the President certified to Congress 
        (A) that the continued presence of United States forces in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was required in 
        order to meet the national security interests of the United 
        States, and (B) that United States Armed Forces will not serve 
        as, or be used as, civil police in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
            (5) With that certification, the President submitted to 
        Congress a report stating that the goal of the military presence 
        in Bosnia and Herzegovina is to establish the conditions under 
        which implementation of the Dayton Accords can continue without 
        the support of a major NATO-led military force and setting forth 
        the criteria for determining when that goal has been 
        accomplished.
            (6) Since the administration has not specified how long 
        achievement of that goal is expected to take, the mission of 
        United States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
        essentially of indefinite duration.
            (7) The NATO operations plan for the Stabilization Force 
        (Operations Plan 10407, which went into effect on June 20, 1998, 
        after approval by allied foreign ministers) incorporates all of 
        the benchmarks set forth in the report referred to in paragraph 
        (5) and states that the Stabilization Force will develop 
        detailed criteria for assessing progress in achieving those 
        benchmarks in close coordination with key international 
        organizations participating in civilian implementation of the 
        Dayton Accords.
            (8) The military representatives of NATO member nations have 
        been tasked by the North Atlantic Council to provide estimates 
        of the time likely to be required for implementation of the 
        Dayton Accords.
            (9) NATO has decided to conduct formal reviews when 
        appropriate (but at intervals of not more than 6 months) to 
        assess the security situation and the progress being made in the 
        implementation of the civil aspects of the Dayton Accords. Those 
        reviews will enable the Alliance to make decisions as to 
        reductions in the size or the Stabilization Force, leading to 
        its eventual full withdrawal.
            (10) NATO has approved the creation of a multinational 
        specialized unit of gendarmes or paramilitary police composed of 
        European security forces to help promote public security in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina as a part of the post-June 1998 mission 
        for the Stabilization Force.
            (11) The limit established for spending by the United States 
        for the defense discretionary budget category for fiscal year 
        1998 in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
        1985 does not take into account the continued deployment of 
        United States forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 
        1998, leading to the request by the President for emergency 
        supplemental appropriations for the Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        mission through September 30, 1998.
            (12) Amounts for Department of Defense operations in Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina during fiscal year 1999 were not

[[Page 112 STAT. 2147]]

        included in the budget of the President for fiscal year 1999, as 
        submitted to Congress on February 2, 1998.
            (13) The President requested $1,858,600,000 in emergency 
        appropriations in his March 4, 1998, amendment to the fiscal 
        year 1999 budget to cover the shortfall in funding in fiscal 
        year 1999 for the costs of extending the mission in Bosnia.

SEC. 1202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Sense of Congress Concerning United States Forces and 
Accomplishment of Tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) United States ground combat forces should not remain in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely in view of the worldwide 
        commitments of the Armed Forces of the United States;
            (2) the President should work with NATO allies and the other 
        nations whose military forces are participating in the NATO-led 
        Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground combat 
        forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable period of 
        time, consistent with the safety of those forces and the 
        accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military tasks;
            (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United 
        States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina might be 
        suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina if the 
        European Security and Defense Identity is not sufficiently 
        developed or is otherwise considered inappropriate for such a 
        mission; and
            (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate 
        support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on 
        force for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including command and control, 
        intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve 
        force in the region.

    (b) Sense of Congress Concerning Presidential Actions.--It is the 
sense of Congress that the President--
            (1) should inform the European NATO allies of the expression 
        of the sense of Congress in subsection (a) and should strongly 
        urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a Western 
        European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on force to 
        the Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and 
        stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and
            (2) should consult closely with the congressional leadership 
        and the congressional defense committees with respect to the 
        progress being made toward achieving a sustainable peace in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina and the progress being made toward a 
        reduction and ultimate withdrawal of United States ground combat 
        forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

    (c) Sense of Congress Concerning Defense Budget.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) the President should include in the budget for the 
        Department of Defense that the President submits to Congress 
        under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for each 
        fiscal year sufficient amounts to pay for any proposed 
        continuation of the participation of United States forces in 
        NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina during that fiscal 
        year; and

[[Page 112 STAT. 2148]]

            (2) amounts included in the budget for the purpose stated in 
        paragraph (1) should be over and above the defense discretionary 
        estimates as identified in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement of 
        May 16, 1997 and the fiscal year 1998 concurrent budget 
        resolution and not be transferred from amounts in the budget of 
        any other agency of the executive branch, but instead should be 
        an overall increase in the budget for the Department of Defense 
        and the discretionary spending limits in the Balanced Budget Act 
        of 1997.

SEC. 1203. PRESIDENTIAL REPORTS.

    (a) Required Reports.--The President shall ensure that the 
semiannual reports required by section 7(b) of the general provisions of 
chapter I of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act

                    (D) the missions undertaken by those forces, if any, 
                in support of international and local civilian 
                authorities.

        in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including, for each mission 
        identified pursuant to paragraph (4), the assessment of the 
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding the nature and 
        level of risk of the mission for the safety and well-being of

            (6) An assessment of the cost to the United States, by 
        fiscal year, of carrying out the missions identified pursuant to

                military and paramilitary forces; and
                    (B) the establishment and support of a forward-based 
                United States rapid response force outside of Bosnia and 
                Herzegovina that would be capable of deploying rapidly 
                to defeat military threats to a European follow-on force 
                inside Bosnia and Herzegovina and of providing whatever 
                logistical, intelligence, and air support is needed to 
                ensure that a European follow-on force is fully capable 
                of accomplishing its missions under the Dayton Accords.

SEC. 1212. SUBMISSION OF REPORT ON OBJECTIVES OF A CONTINGENCY OPERATION 
            WITH REQUESTS FOR FUNDING FOR THE OPERATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On May 3, 1994, the President issued Presidential 
        Decision Directive 25 declaring that American participation in 
        United Nations and other peace operations would depend in part 
        on whether the role of United States forces is tied to clear 
        objectives and an endpoint for United States participation can 
        be identified.
            (2) Between that date and mid-1998, the President and other 
        executive branch officials have obligated or requested 
        appropriations of approximately $9,400,000,000 for military-
        related operations throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina without 
        providing to Congress, in conjunction with the budget submission 
        for any fiscal year, a strategic plan for such operations under 
        the criteria set forth in that Presidential Decision Directive.
            (3) Between November 27, 1995, and mid-1998 the President 
        has established three deadlines, since elapsed, for the 
        termination of United States military-related operations 
        throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.
            (4) On December 17, 1997, the President announced that 
        United States ground combat forces would remain in Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina for an unknown period of time.
            (5) Approximately 47,880 United States military personnel 
        (excluding personnel serving in units assigned to the Republic

[[Page 112 STAT. 2152]]

        of Korea) have participated in 14 international contingency 
        operations between fiscal years 1991 and 1998.
            (6) The 1998 posture statements of the Navy and Air Force 
        included declarations that the pace of military operations over 
        fiscal year 1997 adversely affected the readiness of non-
        deployed forces, personnel retention rates, and spare parts 
        inventories of the Navy and Air Force.

    (b) Information To Be Reported With Funding Requests.--Section 113 
of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding after subsection 
(l), as added by section 915, the following new subsection:
    ``(m) Information To Accompany Funding Request for Contingency 
Operation.--Whenever the President submits to Congress a request for 
appropriations for costs associated with a contingency operation that 
involves, or likely will involve, the deployment of more than 500 
members of the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report on the objectives of the operation. The report shall 
include a discussion of the following:
            ``(1) What clear and distinct objectives guide the 
        activities of United States forces in the operation.
            ``(2) What the President has identified on the basis of 
        those objectives as the date, or the set of conditions, that 
        defines the endpoint of the operation.''.

SEC. 1504. RUSSIAN NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 7,000 to 12,000 or more nonstrategic (or 
        ``tactical'') nuclear weapons estimated by the United States 
        Strategic Command to be in the Russian arsenal may present the 
        greatest threat of sale or theft of a nuclear warhead in the 
        world today.
            (2) As the number of deployed strategic warheads in the 
        Russian and United States arsenals declines to just a few 
        thousand under the START accords, Russia's vast superiority in 
        tactical nuclear warheads--many of which have yields equivalent 
        to strategic nuclear weapons--could become strategically 
        destabilizing.
            (3) While the United States has unilaterally reduced its 
        inventory of tactical nuclear weapons by nearly 90 percent since 
        the end of the Cold War, Russia is behind schedule in 
        implementing the steep tactical nuclear arms reductions pledged 
        by former Soviet President Gorbachev in 1991 and Russian 
        President Yeltsin in 1992, perpetuating the dangers from 
        Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should call on Russia to expedite reduction of its tactical 
nuclear arsenal in accordance with the promises made in 1991 and 1992.
    (c) Report.--Not later than March 15, 1999, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to Congress a report on the nonstrategic nuclear weapons of 
Russia. The report shall include--
            (1) estimates regarding the current numbers, types, yields, 
        viability, and locations of those weapons;
            (2) an assessment of the strategic implications of Russia's 
        nonstrategic arsenal, including the potential use of those 
        weapons in a strategic role or the use of their components in 
        strategic

[[Page 112 STAT. 2173]]

        nuclear systems and the potential of Russian superiority in 
        tactical nuclear weapons to destabilize the overall nuclear 
        balance as strategic nuclear weapons are sharply reduced under 
        the START accords;
            (3) an assessment of the extent of the current threat of 
        theft, sale, or unauthorized use of the warheads of those 
        weapons, including an analysis of Russian command and control as 
        it concerns the use of tactical nuclear weapons;

SEC. 1511. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2778 note.>> SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States business interests must not be placed 
        above United States national security interests;
            (2) United States foreign policy and the policies of the 
        United States regarding commercial relations with other 
        countries should affirm the importance of observing and adhering 
        to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR);
            (3) the United States should encourage universal observance 
        of the Guidelines to the Missile Technology Control Regime;
            (4) the exportation or transfer of advanced communication 
        satellites and related technologies from United States sources 
        to foreign recipients should not increase the risks to the 
        national security of the United States;
            (5) due to the military sensitivity of the technologies 
        involved, it is in the national security interests of the United 
        States that United States satellites and related items be 
        subject to the same export controls that apply under United 
        States law and practices to munitions;
            (6) the United States should not issue any blanket waiver of 
        the suspensions contained in section 902 of the Foreign 
        Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public 
        Law 101-246), regarding the export of satellites of United

        States origin intended for launch from a launch vehicle owned by 
        the People's Republic of China;
            (7) the United States should pursue policies that protect 
        and enhance the United States space launch industry; and
            (8) the United States should not export to the People's 
        Republic of China missile equipment or technology that would 
        improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's 
        Republic of China.

        commit not to conduct any additional nuclear tests;
            (3) urges the Governments of India and Pakistan to take 
        immediate steps to reduce tensions between the two countries;

[[Page 112 STAT. 2181]]

            (4) urges India and Pakistan to engage in high-level 
        dialogue aimed at reducing the likelihood of armed conflict, 
        enacting confidence and security building measures, and 
        resolving areas of dispute;
            (5) commends all nations to take steps which will reduce 
        tensions in South Asia, including appropriate measures to 
        prevent the transfer of technology that could further exacerbate 
        the arms race in South Asia, and thus avoid further 
        deterioration of security there;
            (6) calls upon the President, leaders of all nations, and 
        the United Nations to encourage a diplomatic, negotiated 
        solution between the Governments of India and Pakistan to 
        promote peace and stability in South Asia and resolve the 
        current impasse;

        disputed territory in Kashmir;
            (8) urges India and Pakistan to take immediate, binding, and 
        verifiable steps to roll back their nuclear programs and come 
        into compliance with internationally accepted norms regarding 
        the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and
            (9) urges the United States to reevaluate its bilateral 
        relationship with India and Pakistan, in light of the new 
        regional security realities in South Asia, with the goal of 
        preventing further nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation, 
        diffusing long-standing regional rivalries between India and 
        Pakistan, and securing commitments from India and Pakistan 
        which, if carried out, could result in a calibrated lifting of 
        United States sanctions imposed under the Arms Export Control 
        Act and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994.
