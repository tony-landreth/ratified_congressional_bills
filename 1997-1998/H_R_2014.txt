                later date as may be specified by the Secretary of the 
                Treasury, such transaction and position are clearly

                taxpayer who elects under subsection (e) or (f) of 
                section 475 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as 
                added by this section) to change its method of

        respect to any partnership item takes effect (within the meaning 
        of subsection (d)(2)) during any partnership taxable year and if 
        an election under paragraph (2) does not apply to such 
        adjustment, such adjustment shall be taken into account in

        year in which such adjustment takes effect. In applying this 
        title to any person who is (directly or indirectly) a partner in 
        such partnership during such partnership taxable year, such 
        adjustment shall be treated as an item actually arising during

        taxable year in which such partnership adjustment takes effect, 
        such other adjustment shall be taken into account under this

        computed under this paragraph with respect to any partnership

        chapter 67--
                    ``(A) on the imputed underpayment determined under

        penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which it 
        would have been liable if such partnership had been an 
        individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the adjusted year 
        and the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) were 
        an actual underpayment (or understatement) for such year.

        subsection, the imputed underpayment determined under this

                rate of tax in effect under section 1 or 11 for the

        For purposes of the preceding sentence, any net decrease in a 
        loss shall be treated as an increase in income and a similar 
        rule shall apply to a net increase in a loss.

applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for 
which the partnership may be liable under section 6242(b)).

under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission

            ``(1) a taxpayer files an oversheltered return for a taxable 
        year,
            ``(2) the Secretary makes a determination with respect to

            ``(3) the adjustments resulting from such determination do 
        not give rise to a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) but

if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after 
the day on which the notice of adjustment authorized in subsection (a)

Court for redetermination of the adjustments. Upon the filing of such a 
petition, the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to make a declaration 
with respect to all items (other than partnership items and affected 
items which require partner level determinations as described in section 
6230(a)(2)(A)(i)) for the taxable year to which the notice of adjustment 
relates, in accordance with the principles of section 6214(a). Any such

        return during the pendency of the refund claim (and, if within 
        the time prescribed by section 6532 the taxpayer commences a 
        civil action for refund under section 7422, until the decision

        adjustment.--If the Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to 
        the taxpayer for a taxable year, the period of limitations on 
        the making of assessments shall be suspended for the period 
        during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the 
        assessment (and, in any event, if a proceeding in respect of the 
        notice of adjustment is placed on the docket of the Tax Court,

        deficiency with respect to any tax imposed by subtitle A 
        attributable to any item (other than a partnership item or any 
        item affected by a partnership item) shall be made--

mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year and the 
taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed 
in subsection (c), the Secretary may not mail another such notice to the 
taxpayer with respect to the same taxable year in the absence of a 
showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact.

            ``(1) In general.--The treatment of any item that has been 
        determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) shall be taken into

        regardless of whether any assessment has been made with respect 
        to such adjustment.

        the case of a computational adjustment that is made in 
        connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter

        shall apply only if the computational adjustment is made within 
        the period prescribed by section 6229 for assessing any tax 
        under subtitle A which is attributable to any partnership item
