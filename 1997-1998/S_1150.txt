SEC. 253. FOREST AND RANGELAND RENEWABLE RESOURCES RESEARCH.

    (a) Findings.--Section 2 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable 
Resources Research Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641) is amended by striking 
``Sec. 2.'' and subsection (a) and inserting the following:

``SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Forests and rangeland, and the resources of forests 
        and rangeland, are of strategic economic and ecological 
        importance to the United States, and the Federal Government has 
        an important and substantial role in ensuring the continued 
        health, productivity, and sustainability of the forests and 
        rangeland of the United States.
            ``(2) Over 75 percent of the productive commercial forest 
        land in the United States is privately owned, with some 60 
        percent owned by small nonindustrial private owners. These 
        10,000,000 nonindustrial private owners are critical to 
        providing both commodity and noncommodity values to the citizens 
        of the United States.
            ``(3) The National Forest System manages only 17 percent of 
        the commercial timberland of the United States, with over half 
        of the standing softwoods inventory located on that land. 
        Dramatic changes in Federal agency policy during the early 
        1990's have significantly curtailed the management of this vast 
        timber resource, causing abrupt shifts in the supply of timber 
        from public to private ownership. As a result of these shifts in 
        supply, some 60 percent of total wood production in the United 
        States is now coming from private forest land in the southern 
        United States.
            ``(4) At the same time that pressures are building for the 
        removal of even more land from commercial production, the 
        Federal Government is significantly reducing its commitment to 
        productivity-related research regarding forests and rangeland, 
        which is critically needed by the private sector for the 
        sustained management of remaining available timber and forage 
        resources for the benefit of all species.
            ``(5) Uncertainty over the availability of the United States 
        timber supply, increasing regulatory burdens, and the lack of 
        Federal Government support for research is causing domestic wood 
        and paper producers to move outside the United States to find 
        reliable sources of wood supplies, which in turn results in a 
        worsening of the United States trade balance, the loss of 
        employment and infrastructure investments, and an increased risk 
        of infestations of exotic pests and diseases from imported wood 
        products.
            ``(6) Wood and paper producers in the United States are 
        being challenged not only by shifts in Federal Government 
        policy, but also by international competition from tropical 
        countries where growth rates of trees far exceed those in the 
        United States. Wood production per acre will need to quadruple 
        from 1996 levels for the United States forestry sector to remain 
        internationally competitive on an ever decreasing forest land 
        base.
            ``(7) Better and more frequent forest inventorying and 
        analysis is necessary to identify productivity-related forestry 
        research needs and to provide forest managers with the current

[[Page 112 STAT. 559]]

        data necessary to make timely and effective management 
        decisions.''.

    (b) High Priority Forestry and Rangeland Research and Education.--

of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1642) is amended by striking subsection (d) and 
inserting the following:

            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may conduct, support, and 
        cooperate in forestry and rangeland research and education that 
        is of the highest priority to the United States and to users of 
        public and private forest land and rangeland in the United 
        States.

    (a) Research Grant Authorized.--The Secretary of Agriculture may 
make a grant to a consortium of land-grant colleges and universities to

    (b) Research Components.--Funds provided under this section shall be 
available for the following collaborative, multi-State research 
activities:
            (1) Identification and understanding of the epidemiology of 
        wheat scab and the toxicological properties of vomitoxin, a 
        toxic metabolite commonly occurring in wheat and barley infected 
        with wheat scab.
            (2) Development of crop management strategies to reduce the 
        risk of wheat scab occurrence.
            (3) Development of--
                    (A) efficient and accurate methods to monitor wheat 
                and barley for the presence of wheat scab and resulting 
                vomitoxin contamination;
                    (B) post-harvest management techniques for wheat and 
                barley infected with wheat scab; and

        scab, including the establishment of a regional advanced 
        breeding material evaluation nursery and a germplasm 
        introduction and evaluation system.
            (5) Development and deployment of alternative fungicide 
        application systems and formulations to control wheat scab and 
        consideration of other chemical control strategies to assist 
        farmers until new more resistant wheat and barley varieties are 
        available.

    (c) Communications Networks.--Funds provided under this section 
shall be available for efforts to concentrate, integrate, and 
disseminate research, extension, and outreach-orientated information 
regarding wheat scab.
    (d) Management.--To oversee the use of a grant made under this 
section, the Secretary may establish a committee composed of the 
directors of the agricultural experiment stations in the States in which 
land-grant colleges and universities that are members of the consortium 
are located.
