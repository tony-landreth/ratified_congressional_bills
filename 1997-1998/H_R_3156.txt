Public Law 105-215
105th Congress

                                 An Act


 
       To present a congressional gold medal to Nelson Rolihlahla 
            Mandela. <<NOTE: July 29, 1998 -  [H.R. 3156]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION <<NOTE: 31 USC 5111 note.>> 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nelson Mandela has dedicated his entire life to the 
        abolition of apartheid and the creation of a true democracy in 
        the Republic of South Africa and has sacrificed his own personal 
        freedom for the good of everyone.
            (2) For nearly 30 years as a political prisoner, Nelson 
        Mandela never compromised his political principles, was a source 
        of strength and education for other political prisoners, and 
        refused offers of freedom in exchange for a renunciation of his 
        personal and political beliefs.
            (3) After his release from prison, Nelson Mandela continued 
        to pursue his goal of a free South Africa, and was elected and 
        subsequently inaugurated as State President of the Republic of 
        South Africa on May 10, 1994, at the age of 75 years.
            (4) <<NOTE: Desmond Tutu.>> Nelson Mandela's dedication to 
        freedom did not cease once the apartheid laws were lifted, as he 
        then focused his efforts toward reconciliation by creating the 
        Truth and 
        Reconciliation Commission, chaired by the Archbishop Desmond 
        Tutu.
            (5) Nelson Mandela is the recipient of many awards and 
        accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize (which he accepted 
        with then-State President F.W. de Klerk in 1993), and more than 
        50 honorary degrees from universities around the world.
            (6) <<NOTE: Amy Elizabeth Biehl. Peter Biehl. Linda 
        Biehl.>> Millions of individuals of all races and backgrounds in 
        the United States and around the world followed Nelson Mandela's 
        example and fought for the abolition of apartheid in the 
        Republic of South Africa and in this regard the Congress 
        recognizes Amy Elizabeth Biehl, an American student who lost her 
        life in the struggle to free South Africa from racial 
        oppression, and the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation 
        displayed by her parents, Peter and Linda Biehl.
            (7) Nelson Mandela is a prime example of how to work to heal 
        the wounds of racism.
