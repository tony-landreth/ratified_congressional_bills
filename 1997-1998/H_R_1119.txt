[[Page 111 STAT. 1680]]

SEC. 328. PROHIBITION OF IMPLEMENTATION OF TIERED READINESS SYSTEM.

    (a) Prohibition.--The Secretary of a military department may not 
implement, or be required to implement, a new readiness system for units 
of the Armed Forces (as outlined in sections 329 and 330), under which a 
military unit would be categorized into one of several categories (known 
as ``tiers'') according to the likelihood that the unit will be required 
to respond to a military conflict and the time in which the unit will be 
required to respond, if that system would have the effect of changing 
the methods used as of October 1, 1996, by the Armed Forces under the 
jurisdiction of that Secretary for determining the priorities for 
allocating to such military units funding, personnel, equipment, 
equipment maintenance, and training resources, and the associated levels 
of readiness of those units that result from those priorities.
    (b) Report to Congress Requesting Waiver.--If the Secretary of 
Defense determines, following the review required by sections 329 and 
330 (or any similar review), that implementation for one or more of the 
Armed Forces of a tiered readiness system that is prohibited by 
subsection (a) would be in the national security interests of the United 
States, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth 
that determination, together with the rationale for that determination, 
and a request for the enactment of legislation to allow implementation 
of such a system.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) is intended to 
preclude the Secretary of Defense from taking necessary actions to 
maintain the combat preparedness of the active and reserve components of 
the Armed Forces.

SEC. 329. REPORT ON MILITARY READINESS REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Requirement for Report.--Not later than January 31, 1998, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the military readiness requirements of 
the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces (including combat 
units, combat support units, and combat service support units). The 
report shall assess such requirements under a tiered readiness and 
response system that categorizes a given unit according to the 
likelihood that it will be required to respond to a military conflict 
and the time within which it will be required to respond.
    (b) Preparation by JCS and Commanders of Unified Commands.--The 
report required by subsection (a) shall be prepared jointly by the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Staff of the Army, 
the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the 
Commandant of the Marine Corps, the commander of the Special Operations 
Command, and the commanders of the other unified commands.
    (c) Assessment Scenario.--The report shall assess readiness 
requirements in a scenario that is based on the following assumptions:
            (1) That the Armed Forces of the United States must be 
        capable of--
                    (A) fighting and winning, in concert with allies, 
                two major theater wars nearly simultaneously; and
                    (B) deterring or defeating a strategic attack on the 
                United States.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1681]]

            (2) That the forces available for deployment are the forces 
        included in the force structure recommended in the Quadrennial 
        Defense Review, including all other planned force enhancements.

    (d) Assessment Elements.--(1) The report shall identify, by unit 
type, all major units of the active and reserve components of the Armed 
Forces and assess the readiness requirements of the units. Each 
identified unit shall be categorized within one of the following 
classifications:
            (A) Forward-deployed and crisis response forces, or ``Tier 
        I'' forces, that possess limited internal sustainment capability 
        and do not require immediate access to regional air bases or 
        ports or overflight rights, including the following:
                    (i) Force units that are deployed in rotation at sea 
                or on land outside the United States.
                    (ii) Combat-ready crises response forces that are 
                capable of mobilizing and deploying within 10 days after 
                receipt of orders.
                    (iii) Forces that are supported by prepositioning 
                equipment afloat or are capable of being inserted into a 
                theater upon the capture of a port or airfield by 
                forcible entry forces.
            (B) Combat-ready follow-on forces, or ``Tier II'' forces, 
        that can be mobilized and deployed to a theater within 
        approximately 60 days after receipt of orders.
            (C) Combat-ready conflict resolution forces, or ``Tier III'' 
        forces, that can be mobilized and deployed to a theater within 
        approximately 180 days after receipt of orders.
            (D) All other active and reserve component force units which 
        are not categorized within a classification described in 
        subparagraph (A), (B), or (C).

    (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the following units are major 
units:
            (A) In the case of the Army or Marine Corps, a brigade and a 
        battalion.
            (B) In the case of the Navy, a squadron of aircraft, a ship, 
        and a squadron of ships.
            (C) In the case of the Air Force, a squadron of aircraft.

    (e) Projection of Savings for Use for Modernization.--The report 
shall include a projection for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 of the 
amounts of the savings in operation and maintenance funding that--
            (1) could be derived by each of the Armed Forces by placing 
        as many units as is practicable into the lower readiness 
        categories among the tiers; and
            (2) could be made available for force modernization.

    (f) Form of Report.--The report under this section shall be 
submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified annex.
    (g) Planned Force Enhancement Defined.--In this section, the term 
``planned force enhancement'', with respect to the force structure 
recommended in the Quadrennial Defense Review, means any future 
improvement in the capability of the force (including current strategic 
and future improvement in strategic lift capability) that is assumed in 
the development of the recommendation for the force structure set forth 
in the Quadrennial Defense Review.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1682]]

SEC. 330. ASSESSMENT OF CYCLICAL READINESS POSTURE OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Requirement.--(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress 
a report on the readiness posture of the Armed Forces described in 
subsection (b).
    (2) The Secretary shall prepare the report required under paragraph 
(1) with the assistance of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In providing such 
assistance, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall consult with 
the Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
    (b) Readiness Posture.--(1) The readiness posture to be covered by 
the report under subsection (a) is a readiness posture for units of the 
Armed Forces, or for designated units of the Armed Forces, that provides 
for a rotation of such units between a state of high readiness and a 
state of low readiness.
    (2) As part of the evaluation of the readiness posture described in 
paragraph (1), the report shall address in particular a readiness 
posture that--
            (A) establishes within the Armed Forces two equivalent 
        forces each structured so as to be capable of fighting and 
        winning a major theater war; and
            (B) provides for an alternating rotation of such forces 
        between a state of high readiness and a state of low readiness.

    (3) The evaluation of the readiness posture described in paragraph 
(2) shall be based upon assumptions permitting comparison with the 
existing force structure as follows:
            (A) That there are assembled from among the units of the 
        Armed Forces two equivalent forces each structured so as to be 
        capable of fighting and winning a major theater war.
            (B) That each force referred to in subparagraph (A) 
        includes--
                    (i) four active Army divisions, including one 
                mechanized division, one armored division, one light 
                infantry division, and one division combining airborne 
                units and air assault units, and appropriate support and 
                service support units for such divisions;
                    (ii) six divisions (or division equivalents) of the 
                Army National Guard or the Army Reserve that are 
                essentially equivalent in structure, and appropriate 
                support and service support units for such divisions;
                    (iii) six aircraft carrier battle groups;
                    (iv) six active Air Force fighter wings (or fighter 
                wing equivalents);
                    (v) four Air Force reserve fighter wings (or fighter 
                wing equivalents); and
                    (vi) one active Marine Corps expeditionary force.
            (C) That each force may be supplemented by critical units or 
        units in short supply, including heavy bomber units, strategic 
        lift units, and aerial reconnaissance units, that are not 
        subject to the readiness rotation otherwise assumed for purposes 
        of the evaluation or are subject to the rotation on a modified 
        basis.
            (D) That units of the Armed Forces not assigned to a force 
        are available for operations other than those essential to fight 
        and win a major theater war, including peace operations.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1683]]

            (E) That the state of readiness of each force alternates 
        between a state of high readiness and a state of low readiness 
        on a frequency determined by the Secretary (but not more often 
        than once every six months) and with only one force at a given 
        state of readiness at any one time.
            (F) That, during the period of state of high readiness of a 
        force, any operations or activities (including leave and 
        education and training of personnel) that detract from the near-
        term wartime readiness of the force are temporary and their 
        effects on such state of readiness minimized.
            (G) That units are assigned overseas during the period of 
        state of high readiness of the force to which the units are 
        assigned primarily on a temporary duty basis.
            (H) That, during the period of high readiness of a force, 
        the operational war plans for the force incorporate the 
        divisions (or division equivalents) of the Army Reserve or Army 
        National Guard assigned to the force in a manner such that one 
        such division (or division equivalent) is, on a rotating basis 
        for such divisions (or division equivalents) during the period, 
        maintained in a high state of readiness and dedicated as the 
        first reserve combat division to be transferred overseas in the 
        event of a major theater war.

    (c) Report Elements.--The report under this section shall include 
the following elements for the readiness posture described in subsection 
(b)(2):
            (1) An estimate of the range of cost savings achievable over 
        the long term as a result of implementing the readiness posture, 
        including--
                    (A) the savings achievable from reduced training 
                levels and readiness levels during periods in which a 
                force referred to in subsection (b)(3)(A) is in a state 
                of low readiness; and
                    (B) the savings achievable from reductions in costs 
                of infrastructure overseas as a result of reduced 
                permanent change of station rotations.
            (2) An assessment of the potential risks associated with a 
        lower readiness status for units assigned to a force in a state 
        of low readiness under the readiness posture, including the 
        risks associated with the delayed availability of such units 
        overseas in the event of two nearly simultaneous major theater 
        wars.
            (3) An assessment of the potential risks associated with 
        requiring the forces under the readiness posture to fight a 
        major war in any theater worldwide.
            (4) An assessment of the modifications of the current force 
        structure of the Armed Forces that are necessary to achieve the 
        range of cost savings estimated under paragraph (1), including 
        the extent of the diminishment, if any, of the military 
        capabilities of the Armed Forces as a result of the 
        modifications.
            (5) An assessment whether or not the risks of diminished 
        military capability associated with implementation of the 
        readiness posture exceed the risks of diminished military 
        capability associated with the modifications of the current 
        force structure necessary to achieve cost savings equivalent to 
        the best case for cost savings resulting from the implementation 
        of the readiness posture.

        that must be maintained and repaired in Government-owned, 
        Government-operated facilities, using personnel and equipment of 
        the Department, as a result of the Secretary's determination 
        that--
                    (A) the work involves unique or valuable workforce 
                skills that should be maintained in the public sector in 
                the national interest;
                    (B) the base of private sector sources having the 
                capability to perform the workloads includes industry 
                sectors that are vulnerable to work stoppages;
                    (C) the private sector sources having the capability 
                to perform the workloads have insufficient workforce

[[Page 111 STAT. 1703]]

                or skills to perform the depot-level maintenance and 
                repair workloads--
                          (i) in the quantity necessary, or as rapidly 
                      as the Secretary considers necessary, to enable 
                      the armed forces to fulfill the national military 
                      strategy; or
                          (ii) without a significant disruption or delay 
                      in the maintenance and repair of equipment;
                    (D) the need for performance of workloads is too 
                infrequent, cyclical, or variable to sustain a reliable 
                base of private sector sources having the workforce 
                levels or skills to perform the workloads;
                    (E) the market conditions or workloads are 
                insufficient to ensure that the price of private sector 
                performance of the workloads can be controlled through 
                competition or other means;
                    (F) private sector sources are not adequately 
                responsive to the requirements of the Department for 
                rapid, cost-effective, and flexible response to surge 
                requirements or other contingency situations, including 
                changes in the mix or priority of previously scheduled 
                workloads and reassignment of employees to different 
                workloads without the requirement for additional 
                contractual negotiations;
                    (G) private sector sources are less willing to 
                assume responsibility for performing the workload as a 
                result of the possibility of direct military or 
                terrorist attack; or
                    (H) private sector sources cannot maintain 
                continuity of workforce expertise as a result of high 
                rates of employee turnover.

        that must be maintained and repaired in Government-owned

                    (A) the work involves facilities, technologies, or 
                equipment that are unique and sufficiently valuable that 
                the facilities, technologies, or equipment must be 
                maintained in the public sector in the national 
                interest;
                    (B) the private sector sources having the capability 
                to perform the workloads have insufficient facilities, 
                technology, or equipment to perform the depot-level 
                maintenance and repair workloads--
                          (i) in the quantity necessary, or as rapidly 
                      as the Secretary considers necessary, to enable 
                      the armed forces to fulfill the national military 
                      strategy; or
                          (ii) without a significant disruption or delay 
                      in the maintenance and repair of equipment; or
                    (C) the need for performance of workloads is too 
                infrequent, cyclical, or variable to sustain a reliable 
                base of private sector sources having the facilities, 
                technology, or equipment to perform the workloads.
            (3) The systems or equipment identified under subsection (a) 
        that may be maintained and repaired in private sector

        determinations made for purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and 
        (3).

SEC. 366. REVIEW OF USE OF TEMPORARY DUTY ASSIGNMENTS FOR SHIP REPAIR 
            AND MAINTENANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In order to reduce the time that the crew of a naval 
        vessel is away from the homeport of the vessel, the Navy seeks 
        to perform ship repair and maintenance of the vessel at the 
        homeport of the vessel whenever it takes six months or less to 
        accomplish the work involved.
            (2) At the same time, the Navy seeks to distribute ship 
        repair and maintenance work among the Navy shipyards (known as 
        to ``level load'') in order to more fully utilize personnel 
        resources.
            (3) During periods when a Navy shipyard is not utilized to 
        its capacity, the Navy sometimes sends workers at the shipyard, 
        on a temporary duty basis, to perform ship repairs and 
        maintenance at a homeport not having a Navy shipyard.
            (4) This practice is a more efficient use of civilian 
        employees who might otherwise not be fully employed on work 
        assigned to Navy shipyards.

    (b) Comptroller General Review and Report.--(1) The Comptroller 
General shall review the Navy's practice of using temporary duty 
assignments of personnel to perform ship maintenance and repair work at 
homeports not having Navy shipyards. The review shall include the 
following:
            (A) An assessment of the rationale, conditions, and factors 
        supporting the Navy's practice.
            (B) A determination of whether the practice is cost-
        effective.
            (C) The factors affecting future requirements for, and the 
        adherence to, the practice, together with an assessment of the 
        factors.

    (2) Not later than May 1, 1998, the Comptroller General shall submit 
a report on the review to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate 
and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 367. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING REALIGNMENT OF PERFORMANCE OF 
            GROUND COMMUNICATION-ELECTRONIC WORKLOAD.

    It is the sense of Congress that the transfer of the ground 
communication-electronic workload to Tobyhanna Army Depot, Pennsylvania, 
in the realignment of the performance of such function should be carried 
out in adherence to the schedule prescribed for that transfer by the 
Defense Depot Maintenance Council on March 13, 1997, as follows:
            (1) Transfer of 20 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        1998.
            (2) Transfer of 40 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        1999.
            (3) Transfer of 40 percent of the workload in fiscal year 
        2000.

not yet been developed) for purposes of considering the services and 
functions at the military installation for conversion to contractor

        (A) adopt or strengthen incentives for recruiters to thoroughly 
        prescreen potential candidates for recruitment, and (B) link

[[Page 111 STAT. 1739]]

        incentives for recruiters, in part, to the ability of a 
        recruiter to screen out unqualified candidates before 
        enlistment.
            (4) Require that the Secretary of each military department 
        include as a measurement of recruiter performance the percentage 
        of persons enlisted by a recruiter who complete initial combat 
        training or basic training.
            (5) Assess trends in the number and use of waivers over the 
        1991-1997 period that were issued to permit applicants to enlist 
        with medical or other conditions that would otherwise be 
        disqualifying.
            (6) Require the Secretary of each military department to 
        implement policies and procedures (A) to ensure the prompt 
        separation of recruits who are unable to successfully complete 
        basic training, and (B) to remove those recruits from the 
        training environment while separation proceedings are pending.

    (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary shall 
submit to Congress a report of the trends assessed under subsection

or Marine Corps.
    (b) Specific Steps.--As part of those improvements, the Secretary

            (1) Require that each applicant for service in the Army, 
        Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps (A) provide to the Secretary 
        the name of the applicant's medical insurer and the names of 
        past medical providers, and (B) sign a release allowing the 
        Secretary to request and obtain medical records of the 
        applicant.
            (2) Require that the forms and procedures for medical 
        prescreening of applicants that are used by recruiters and by 
        Military Entrance Processing Commands be revised so as to ensure 
        that medical questions are specific, unambiguous, and tied 
        directly to the types of medical separations most common for 
        recruits during basic training and follow-on training.
            (3) Add medical screening tests to the examinations of 
        recruits carried out by Military Entrance Processing Stations, 
        provide more thorough medical examinations to selected groups of 
        applicants, or both, to the extent that the Secretary determines 
        that to do so could be cost effective in reducing attrition at 
        basic training.
            (4) Provide for an annual quality control assessment of the 
        effectiveness of the Military Entrance Processing Commands in 
        identifying medical conditions in recruits that existed before 
        enlistment in the Armed Forces, each such assessment to be 
        performed by an agency or contractor other than the Military 
        Entrance Processing Commands.

        implement programs under which new recruits who are in the 
        Delayed Entry Program are encouraged to participate in physical 
        fitness activities before reporting to basic training.
            (2) Develop a range of incentives for new recruits to 
        participate in physical fitness programs, as well as for those 
        recruits who improve their level of fitness while in the Delayed 
        Entry Program, which may include access to Department of Defense 
        military fitness facilities, and access to military medical 
        facilities in the case of a recruit who is injured while 
        participating in physical activities with recruiters or other 
        military personnel.
            (3) Evaluate whether partnerships between recruiters and 
        reserve components, or other innovative arrangements, could 
        provide a pool of qualified personnel to assist in the conduct 
        of physical training programs for new recruits in the Delayed 
        Entry Program.

SEC. 544. CONTINUATION OF SUPPORT TO SENIOR MILITARY 
            COLLEGES.

    (a) <<NOTE: 10 USC 2111a note.>>  Definition of Senior Military 
Colleges.--For purposes of this section, the term ``senior military 
colleges'' means the 
following:
            (1) Texas A&M University.
            (2) Norwich University.
            (3) The Virginia Military Institute.
            (4) The Citadel.
            (5) Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
            (6) North Georgia College and State University.

    (b) <<NOTE: 10 USC 2111a note.>>  Findings.--Congress finds the 
following:
            (1) The senior military colleges consistently have provided 
        substantial numbers of highly qualified, long-serving leaders to 
        the Armed Forces.
            (2) The quality of the military leaders produced by the 
        senior military colleges is, in part, the result of the rigorous 
        military environment imposed on students attending the senior 
        military colleges by the colleges, as well as the result of the 
        long-standing close support relationship between the Corps of 
        Cadets at each college and the Reserve Officer Training Corps 
        personnel at the colleges who serve as effective leadership role 
        models and mentors.
            (3) In recognition of the quality of the young leaders 
        produced by the senior military colleges, the Department of

[[Page 111 STAT. 1745]]

        Defense and the military services have traditionally maintained 
        special relationships with the colleges, including the policy to 
        grant active duty service in the Army to graduates of the 
        colleges who desire such service and who are recommended for 
        such service by their ROTC professors of military science.
            (4) Each of the senior military colleges has demonstrated an 
        ability to adapt its systems and operations to changing 
        conditions in, and requirements of, the Armed Forces without 
        compromising the quality of leaders produced and without 
        interruption of the close relationship between the colleges and 
        the Department of Defense.

    (c) <<NOTE: 10 USC 2111a note.>>  Sense of Congress.--In light of 
the findings in subsection (b), it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the proposed initiative of the Secretary of the Army to 
        end the commitment to active duty service for all graduates of 
        senior military colleges who desire such service and who are 
        recommended for such service by their ROTC professors of 
        military science is short-sighted and contrary to the long-term 
        interests of the Army;
            (2) as they have in the past, the senior military colleges 
        can and will continue to accommodate to changing military 
        requirements to ensure that future graduates entering military 
        service continue to be officers of superb quality who are 
        quickly assimilated by the Armed Forces and fully prepared to 
        make significant contributions to the Armed Forces through 
        extended military careers; and
            (3) decisions of the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary 
        of a military department that fundamentally and unilaterally 
        change the long-standing relationship of the Armed Forces with 
        the senior military colleges are not in the best interests of 
        the Department of Defense or the Armed Forces and are patently 
        unfair to students who made decisions to enroll in the senior 
        military colleges on the basis of existing Department and Armed 
        Forces policy.

    (d) Continuation of Support for Senior Military 
Colleges.--Section 2111a of title 10, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (f); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new 
        subsections:

    ``(d) Termination or Reduction of Program Prohibited.--The Secretary 
of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments may not take 
or authorize any action to terminate or reduce a unit of the Senior 
Reserve Officers' Training Corps at a senior military college unless the 
termination or reduction is specifically requested by the college.
    ``(e) Assignment to Active Duty.--(1) The Secretary of the Army 
shall ensure that a graduate of a senior military college who desires to 
serve as a commissioned officer on active duty upon graduation from the 
college, who is medically and physically qualified for active duty, and 
who is recommended for such duty by the professor of military science at 
the college, shall be assigned to active duty. This paragraph shall 
apply to a member of the program at a senior military college who 
graduates from the college after March 31, 1997.
    ``(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the 
Secretary of the Army from requiring a member of the program

[[Page 111 STAT. 1746]]

who graduates from a senior military college to serve on active duty.''.
    (e) Technical Corrections.--Subsection (f) of such section, as 
redesignated by subsection (d)(1), is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (2), by striking out ``College'' and

        how that rate compared to the average success rate of cadets and 
        midshipmen during that same period.
            (2) The advantages of permitting United States nationals to 
        participate in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
        program.
            (3) The disadvantages of permitting United States nationals 
        to participate in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps 
        program.
            (4) The incremental cost of including United States 
        nationals in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps.
            (5) Methods of minimizing the risk that United States 
        nationals admitted to the Senior Reserve Officers' Training 
        Corps would be later disqualified because of ineligibility for 
        United States citizenship.
            (6) The recommendations of the Secretary on whether United 
        States nationals should be eligible to participate in the Senior 
        Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, and if so, a

               PART III--TRAINING OF ARMY DRILL SERGEANTS

SEC. 556. <<NOTE: 10 USC 4318 note.>>  REFORM OF ARMY DRILL SERGEANT 
            SELECTION AND TRAINING PROCESS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army shall reform the process 
for selection and training of drill sergeants for the Army.
    (b) Measures To Be Taken.--As part of such reform, the Secretary 
shall undertake the following measures (unless, in the case of any such 
measure, the Secretary determines that that measure would not result in 
improved effectiveness and efficiency in the drill sergeant selection 
and training process):
            (1) Review the overall process used by the Department of the 
        Army for selection of drill sergeants to determine--
                    (A) whether that process is providing drill sergeant 
                candidates in sufficient quantity and quality to meet 
                the needs of the training system; and
                    (B) whether duty as a drill sergeant is a career-
                enhancing assignment (or is seen by potential drill 
                sergeant candidates as a career-enhancing assignment) 
                and what steps could be taken to ensure that such duty 
                is in fact a career-enhancing assignment.
            (2) Incorporate into the selection process for all drill 
        sergeants the views and recommendations of the officers and 
        senior noncommissioned officers in the chain of command of each 
        candidate for selection (particularly those of senior 
        noncommissioned officers) regarding the candidate's suitability 
        and qualifications to be a drill sergeant.
            (3) Establish a requirement for psychological screening for 
        each drill sergeant candidate.
            (4) Reform the psychological screening process for drill 
        sergeant candidates to improve the quality, depth, and rigor of 
        that screening process.
            (5) Revise the evaluation system for drill sergeants in 
        training to provide for a so-called ``whole person'' assessment 
        that gives insight into the qualifications and suitability of a 
        drill sergeant candidate beyond the candidate's ability to 
        accomplish required performance tasks.
            (6) Revise the Army military personnel records system so 
        that, under conditions and circumstances to be specified in 
        regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a drill sergeant 
        trainee who fails to complete the training to be a drill 
        sergeant and is denied graduation will not have the fact of that 
        failure recorded in those personnel records.
            (7) Provide each drill sergeant in training with the 
        opportunity, before or during that training, to work with new 
        recruits in initial entry training and to be evaluated on that 
        opportunity.

    (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary shall 
submit to the Committee on National Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate a 
report of the reforms adopted pursuant to this section or, in the case 
of any measure specified in any of paragraphs (1) through (7) of 
subsection (b) that was not adopted, the rationale why that measure was 
not adopted.

SEC. 562. DUTIES.

    (a) Functions Relating to Requirements and Restrictions Regarding 
Cross-Gender Relationships.--The commission shall consider issues 
relating to personal relationships of members of the Armed Forces as 
follows:
            (1) Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and 
        practices that govern personal relationships between men and 
        women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between 
        members of the Armed Forces and non-military personnel of the 
        opposite sex.
            (2) Assess the extent to which the laws, regulations, 
        policies, and directives have been applied consistently 
        throughout the Armed Forces without regard to the armed force, 
        grade, rank, or gender of the individuals involved.
            (3) Assess the reports of the independent panel, the 
        Department of Defense task force, and the review of existing 
        guidance on fraternization and adultery that have been required 
        by the Secretary of Defense.

    (b) Functions Relating to Gender-Integrated and Gender-Segregated 
Basic Training.--(1) The commission shall review the parts of the 
initial entry training programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine 
Corps that constitute the basic training of new recruits (in this 
subtitle referred to as ``basic training''). The review shall include a 
review of the basic training policies and practices of each of those 
services with regard to gender-integrated and gender-segregated basic 
training and, for each of the services, the effectiveness of gender-
integrated and gender-segregated basic training.
    (2) As part of the review under paragraph (1), the commission shall 
(with respect to each of the services) take the following 
measures:
            (A) Determine how each service defines gender-integration 
        and gender-segregation in the context of basic training.
            (B) Determine the historical rationales for the 
        establishment and disestablishment of gender-integrated or 
        gender-segregated basic training.
            (C) Examine, with respect to each service, the current 
        rationale for the use of gender-integrated or gender-segregated 
        basic training and the rationale that was current as of the time 
        the service made a decision to integrate, or to segregate, basic 
        training by gender (or as of the time of the most recent 
        decision to continue to use a gender-integrated format or a

[[Page 111 STAT. 1752]]

        gender-segregated format for basic training), and, as part of 
        the examination, evaluate whether at the time of that decision, 
        the Secretary of the military department with jurisdiction over 
        that service had substantive reason to believe, or has since 
        developed data to support, that gender-integrated basic 
        training, or gender-segregated basic training, improves the 
        readiness or performance of operational units.
            (D) Assess whether the concept of ``training as you will 
        fight'' is a valid rationale for gender-integrated basic 
        training or whether the training requirements and objectives for 
        basic training are sufficiently different from those of 
        operational units so that such concept, when balanced against 
        other factors relating to basic training, might not be a 
        sufficient rationale for gender-integrated basic training.
            (E) Identify the requirements unique to each service that 
        could affect a decision by the Secretary concerned to adopt a 
        gender-integrated or gender-segregated format for basic training 
        and assess whether the format in use by each service has been 
        successful in meeting those requirements.
            (F) Assess, with respect to each service, the degree to 
        which different standards have been established, or if not 
        established are in fact being implemented, for males and females 
        in basic training for matters such as physical fitness, physical 
        performance (such as confidence and obstacle courses), military 
        skills (such as marksmanship and hand-grenade qualifications), 
        and nonphysical tasks required of individuals and, to the degree 
        that differing standards exist or are in fact being implemented, 
        assess the effect of the use of those differing standards.
            (G) Identify the goals that each service has set forth in 
        regard to readiness, in light of the gender-integrated or 
        gender-segregated format that such service has adopted for basic 
        training, and whether that format contributes to the readiness 
        of operational units.
            (H) Assess the degree to which performance standards in 
        basic training are based on military readiness.
            (I) Evaluate the policies of each of the services regarding 
        the assignment of adequate numbers of female drill instructors 
        in gender-integrated training units who can serve as role models 
        and mentors for female trainees.
            (J) Review Department of Defense and military department 
        efforts to objectively measure or evaluate the effectiveness of 
        gender-integrated basic training, as compared to gender-
        segregated basic training, particularly with regard to the 
        adequacy and scope of the efforts and with regard to the 
        relevancy of findings to operational unit requirements, and 
        determine whether the Department of Defense and the military 
        departments are capable of measuring or evaluating the 
        effectiveness of that training format objectively.
            (K) Compare the pattern of attrition in gender-integrated 
        basic training units with the pattern of attrition in gender-
        segregated basic training units and assess the relevancy of the 
        findings of such comparison.
            (L) Compare the level of readiness and morale of gender-
        integrated basic training units with the level of readiness and 
        morale of gender-segregated units, and assess the relevancy of 
        the findings of such comparison and the implications, for 
        readiness, of any differences found.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1753]]

            (M) Compare the experiences, policies, and practices of the 
        armed forces of other industrialized nations regarding gender-
        integrated training with those of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
        Marine Corps.
            (N) Review, and take into consideration, the current 
        practices, relevant studies, and private sector training 
        concepts pertaining to gender-integrated training.
            (O) Assess the feasibility and implications of conducting 
        basic training (or equivalent training) at the company level and 
        below through separate units for male and female recruits, 
        including the costs and other resource commitments required to 
        implement and conduct basic training in such a manner and the 
        implications for readiness and unit cohesion.
            (P) Assess the feasibility and implications of requiring 
        drill instructors for basic training units to be of the same sex 
        as the recruits in those units if the basic training were to be 
        conducted as described in subparagraph (O).

    (c) Functions Relating to Basic Training Programs 
Generally.--The commission shall review the course objectives, 
structure, and length of the basic training programs of the Army, Navy, 
Air Force, and Marine Corps. The commission shall also review the 
relationship between those basic training objectives and the advanced 
training provided in the initial entry training programs of each of 
those services. As part of that review, the commission shall (with 
respect to each of those services) take the following measures:
            (1) Determine the current end-state objectives established 
        for graduates of basic training, particularly in regard to--
                    (A) physical conditioning;
                    (B) technical and physical skills proficiency;
                    (C) knowledge;
                    (D) military socialization, including the 
                inculcation of service values and attitudes; and
                    (E) basic combat operational requirements.
            (2) Assess whether those current end-state objectives, and 
        basic training itself, should be modified (in structure, length, 
        focus, program of instruction, training methods or otherwise) 
        based, in part, on the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the perspectives of operational 
                units on the quality and qualifications of the initial 
                entry training graduates being assigned to those units, 
                considering in particular whether the basic training 
                system produces graduates who arrive in operational 
                units with an appropriate level of skills, physical 
                conditioning, and degree of military socialization to 
                meet unit requirements and needs.
                    (B) An assessment of the demographics, backgrounds, 
                attitudes, experience, and physical fitness of new 
                recruits entering basic training, considering in 
                particular the question of whether, given the entry 
                level demographics, education, and background of new 
                recruits, the basic training systems and objectives are 
                most efficiently and effectively structured and 
                conducted to produce graduates who meet service needs.
                    (C) An assessment of the perspectives of personnel 
                who conduct basic training with regard to measures 
                required to improve basic training.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1754]]

            (3) Assess the extent to which the initial entry training 
        programs of each of the services continue, after the basic 
        training phases of the programs, effectively to reinforce and 
        advance the military socialization (including the inculcation of 
        service values and attitudes), the physical conditioning, and 
        the attainment and improvement of knowledge and proficiency in 
        fundamental military skills that are begun in basic training.

    (d) Recommendations.--The commission shall prepare--
            (1) with respect to each of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
        Marine Corps, an evaluation of gender-integrated and gender-
        segregated basic training programs, based upon the review under 
        subsection (b);
            (2) recommendations for such changes to the current system 
        of basic training as the commission considers warranted; and
            (3) recommendations for such changes to laws, regulations, 
        policies, directives, and practices referred to in subsection 
        (a)(1) as the commission considers warranted.

shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a report 
setting forth a strategic plan for the work of the commission and the 
activities and initial findings of the commission.
    (2) Not later than September 16, 1998, the commission shall submit a 
final report to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives. The 
final report shall set forth the activities, findings, and 
recommendations of the commission, including any recommendations for 
congressional action and administrative action that the commission 
considers appropriate. The report shall specifically set forth the views 
of the Secretaries of the military departments regarding the matters 
described in subparagraphs (O) and (P) of subsection (b)(2).

                          (i) When rations in kind are not available.

                field duty or sea duty (as defined in regulations 
                prescribed by the Secretary of Defense). For purposes of 
                the preceding sentence, a member shall not be considered 
                to be performing travel under orders away from his 
                designated post of duty if such member--
                          (i) is an enlisted member serving the member's 
                      first tour of active duty;

                      assignment; and
                          (iii) is not actually traveling between 
                      stations pursuant to orders directing a change of

                    (C) Advance payment.--The allowance to an enlisted 
                member, when authorized, may be paid in advance for a 
                period of not more than three months.
            (2) Officers.--An officer of a uniformed service who is 
        entitled to basic pay is, at all times, entitled to the basic 
        allowances for subsistence. An aviation cadet of the Navy, Air 
        Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard is entitled to the same 
        basic allowance for subsistence as is provided for an officer of 
        the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, respectively.

SEC. 603. CONSOLIDATION OF BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR QUARTERS, VARIABLE 
            HOUSING ALLOWANCE, AND OVERSEAS HOUSING ALLOWANCES.

    (a) Consolidation of Allowances.--Section 403 of title 37, United 
States Code, is amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 403. Basic allowance for housing

    ``(a) General Entitlement.--(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, 
a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is entitled 
to a basic allowance for housing at the monthly rates prescribed under 
this section or another provision of law with regard to the applicable 
component of the basic allowance for housing. The amount of the basic 
allowance for housing for a member will vary according to the pay grade 
in which the member is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes, 
the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the 
member. The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.
    ``(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not 
entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents 
unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned 
indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification 
shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary 
of Defense.
    ``(b) Basic Allowance for Housing Inside the United States.--(1) The 
Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of adequate housing in a 
military housing area in the United States for all members of the 
uniformed services entitled to a basic allowance for housing in that 
area. The Secretary shall base the determination upon the costs of 
adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same 
area.
    ``(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the monthly amount of a basic 
allowance for housing for an area of the United States for a member of a 
uniformed service is equal to the difference between--
            ``(A) the monthly cost of adequate housing in that area, as 
        determined by the Secretary of Defense, for members of the 
        uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the 
        same dependency status as the member; and
            ``(B) 15 percent of the national average monthly cost of 
        adequate housing in the United States, as determined by the 
        Secretary, for members of the uniformed services serving in

[[Page 111 STAT. 1776]]

        the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as the 
        member.

    ``(3) The rates of basic allowance for housing shall be reduced as 
necessary to comply with this paragraph. The total amount that may be 
paid for a fiscal year for the basic allowance for housing under this 
subsection is the product of--
            ``(A) the total amount authorized to be paid for such 
        allowance for the preceding fiscal year (as adjusted under 
        paragraph (5)); and
            ``(B) a fraction--
                    ``(i) the numerator of which is the index of the 
                national average monthly cost of housing for June of the 
                preceding fiscal year; and
                    ``(ii) the denominator of which is the index of the 
                national average monthly cost of housing for June of the 
                fiscal year before the preceding fiscal year.

    ``(4) An adjustment in the rates of the basic allowance for housing 
under this subsection as a result of the Secretary's redetermination of 
housing costs in an area shall take effect on the same date as the 
effective date of the next increase in basic pay under section 1009 of 
this title or other provision of law.
    ``(5) In making a determination under paragraph (3) for a fiscal 
year, the amount authorized to be paid for the preceding fiscal year for 
the basic allowance for housing shall be adjusted to reflect changes 
during the year for which the determination is made in the number, grade 
distribution, geographic distribution in the United States, and 
dependency status of members of the uniformed services entitled to the 
allowance from the number of such members during the preceding fiscal 
year.
    ``(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains 
uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing 
within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance 
for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing 
costs in the area, changes in the national average monthly cost of 
housing, or the promotion of the member.
    ``(7) In the case of a member without dependents who is assigned to 
duty inside the United States, the location or the circumstances of 
which make it necessary that the member be reassigned under the 
conditions of low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or 
permanent change of assignment, the member may be treated as if the 
member were not reassigned if the Secretary concerned determines that it 
would be inequitable to base the member's entitlement to, and amount of, 
a basic allowance for housing on the cost of housing in the area to 
which the member is reassigned.
    ``(c) Basic Allowance for Housing Outside the United States.--(1) 
The Secretary of Defense may prescribe an overseas basic allowance for 
housing for a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside of 
the United States. The Secretary shall establish the basic allowance for 
housing under this subsection on the basis of housing costs in the 
overseas area in which the member is assigned.
    ``(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains 
uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an 
overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is 
not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the 
United States may not be reduced as a result

in currency rates.

Accompany Member.--(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents 
who is on permanent duty at a location described in paragraph (2) is 
entitled to a family separation basic allowance for housing under this 
subsection at a monthly rate equal to the rate of the basic allowance 
for housing established under subsection (b) or the overseas basic 
allowance for housing established under subsection (c), whichever 
applies to that location, for members in the same grade at that location 
without dependents.

location--
            ``(A) to which the movement of the member's dependents is 
        not authorized at the expense of the United States under section 
        406 of this title, and the member's dependents do not reside at 
        or near the location; and
            ``(B) at which quarters of the United States are not 
        available for assignment to the member.

duty at a location or under circumstances that, as determined by the 
Secretary concerned, require the member's dependents to reside at a 
different location, the member shall receive a basic allowance for 
housing, as provided in subsection (a) or (b), as if the member were 
assigned to duty in the area in which the dependents reside, regardless 
of whether the member resides in quarters of the United States or is 
also entitled to a family separation basic allowance for housing by 
reason of paragraph (1).
    ``(4) The family separation basic allowance for housing under this 
subsection shall be in addition to any other allowance or per diem that 
the member is otherwise entitled to receive under this title. A member 
may receive a basic allowance for housing under both paragraphs (1) and 
(3).

rating of the member and adequate for the member and dependents of the 
member, if with dependents, is not entitled to a basic allowance for 
housing.
    ``(2) A member without dependents who is in a pay grade above pay 
grade E-6 and who is assigned to quarters in the United States or a 
housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service, 
appropriate to the grade or rank of the member and adequate for the 
member, may elect not to occupy those quarters and instead to receive 
the basic allowance for housing prescribed for the member's pay grade by 
this section.

assigned to quarters of the United States that do not meet the minimum 
adequacy standards established by the Secretary of Defense for members 
in such pay grade, or to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a 
uniformed service that does not meet such standards, may elect not to 
occupy such quarters or facility and instead to receive the basic

member of a uniformed service without dependents who makes a permanent 
change of station for assignment to a unit conducting field operations

the member was necessarily required to procure quarters at the member's 
expense.

concerned shall consider the availability of quarters for members 
serving in pay grade E-5.

uniformed services in a pay grade below pay grade E-6 who are married to 
each other, have no other dependents, and are simultaneously assigned to 
sea duty are jointly entitled to one basic allowance for housing during 
the period of such simultaneous sea duty. The amount of the allowance 
shall be based on the without dependents rate for the pay grade of the 
senior member of the couple. However, this subparagraph shall not apply 
to a couple if one or both of the members are entitled to a basic 
allowance for housing under subparagraph (B).

(including those restricting the occupancy of housing facilities under 
the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States by 
members, and their dependents, of the armed forces above specified

participation of physicians in CHAMPUS. The study shall include an 
evaluation of the following:
            (1) The methodology used by the Secretary of Defense to

            (4) The difficultly of CHAMPUS in ensuring physician

        formulary for military treatment facility pharmacies and 
        civilian contractor pharmacy benefit administrators.
            (2) The reasons that military treatment facilities deny 
        covered beneficiaries access to pharmacy care and shift such 
        beneficiaries to other sources of pharmacy care.
            (3) The merits and feasibility of using private sector cost 
        control mechanisms implemented by authorized civilian 
        contractors in the Department of Defense medical programs, and 
        the existence of any barriers to the use of such mechanisms, 
        including factors that may undermine the incentives of such 
        contractors to optimize treatment outcomes in managing the care 
        of covered beneficiaries without exceeding budgeted resources.
            (4) The cost impacts, if any, of the use of commercial 
        managed care methods of furnishing pharmaceuticals to covered 
        beneficiaries by TRICARE program contractors instead of

[[Page 111 STAT. 1822]]

        procuring pharmaceuticals at discounted prices pursuant to 
        section 8126 of title 38, United States Code.
            (5) The existence of options for increasing the discounts 
        available to TRICARE program contractors without undermining 
        controls for preventing diversion of items procured by the 
        Department of Defense to nonmilitary populations.

    (b) <<NOTE: Reports.>>  Response to Study.--Not later than 90 days 
after the Comptroller General submits to Congress the study required by

SEC. 752. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR RETIREES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many retired military personnel believe that they were 
        promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years 
        of service.
            (2) Military retirees are the only Federal Government 
        personnel who have been prevented from using their employer-
        provided health care at or after 65 years of age.
            (3) Military health care has become increasingly difficult 
        to obtain for military retirees as the Department of Defense 
        reduces its health care infrastructure.
            (4) Military retirees deserve to have a health care program 
        that is at least comparable with that of retirees from civilian 
        employment by the Federal Government.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1824]]

            (5) The availability of quality, lifetime health care is a 
        critical recruiting incentive for the Armed Forces.
            (6) Quality health care is a critical aspect of the quality 
        of life of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States has incurred a moral obligation to 
        provide health care to members and former members of the Armed 
        Forces who are entitled to retired or retainer pay (or its 
        equivalent);
            (2) it is, therefore, necessary to provide quality, 
        affordable health care to such retirees; and
            (3) Congress and the President should take steps to address 
        the problems associated with the availability of health care for 
        such retirees within two years after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act.

        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public 
        Law 103-337; 10 U.S.C. 1074 note), and sections 270 and 271 of 
        the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 
        (Public Law 103-160; 107 Stat. 1613).
            (2) Recommendations regarding additional research regarding 
        Gulf War illnesses, including research regarding the nature and 
        causes of Gulf War illnesses and appropriate treatments for such 
        illnesses.
            (3) The adequacy of Federal funding and the need for 
        additional funding for medical research initiatives regarding 
        Gulf War illnesses.

SEC. 770. <<NOTE: 10 USC 1074 note.>>  PERSIAN GULF ILLNESS CLINICAL 
            TRIALS PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are many ongoing studies that investigate risk 
        factors which may be associated with the health problems 
        experienced by Persian Gulf veterans; however, there have been 
        no studies that examine health outcomes and the effectiveness of 
        the treatment received by such veterans.
            (2) The medical literature and testimony presented in 
        hearings on Gulf War illnesses indicate that there are 
        therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, that have been 
        effective in treating patients with symptoms similar to those 
        seen in many Persian Gulf veterans.

    (b) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting jointly, shall establish a program 
of cooperative clinical trials at multiple sites to assess the 
effectiveness of protocols for treating Persian Gulf veterans who suffer 
from ill-defined or undiagnosed conditions. Such protocols shall include 
a multidisciplinary treatment model, of which cognitive behavioral 
therapy is a component.
    (c) Funding.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated in section 
201(1) for research, development, test, and evaluation for the Army, the 
sum of $4,500,000 shall be available for program element 62787A (medical 
technology) in the budget of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 
1998 to carry out the clinical trials program established pursuant to 
subsection (b).

SEC. 771. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING GULF WAR ILLNESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Americans served in the Persian Gulf Conflict of 1991 in 
        defense of vital national security interests of the United 
        States.
            (2) It was known to United States intelligence and military 
        commanders that biological and chemical agents were in theater 
        throughout the conflict.
            (3) An undetermined amount of these agents were released 
        into theater.
            (4) A large number of United States military veterans and 
        allied veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of 
        operations have been stricken with a variety of severe 
        illnesses.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1830]]

            (5) Previous efforts to discern the causes of those 
        illnesses have been inadequate, and those illnesses are 
        affecting the health of both veterans and their families.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that all 
promising technology and treatments relating to Gulf War illnesses 
should be fully explored and tested to facilitate treatment for members 
of the Armed Forces and veterans who served the United States in the 
Persian Gulf conflict and are stricken with unexplainable illness.

SEC. 931. TRANSFER OF CERTAIN MILITARY DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS FROM TIARA 
            BUDGET AGGREGATION.

    (a) Transfer.--Effective <<NOTE: Effective date.>>  March 1, 1998, 
the Secretary of Defense shall, for each program identified by the

[[Page 111 STAT. 1864]]

            (1) shall consider whether the current policy is in need of 
        revision to reflect changes in technology and battlefield use of 
        TIARA systems;
            (2) shall specifically consider the appropriateness of the 
        continued inclusion in the TIARA budget aggregation of each of 
        the programs described in subsection (e); and
            (3) may consider the appropriateness of the continued 
        inclusion in the TIARA budget aggregation of any other program 
        (in addition to the programs described to in subsection (e)) 
        that as of the date of the enactment of this Act is managed and 
        budgeted as part of the TIARA budget aggregation.

SEC. 932. REPORT ON COORDINATION OF ACCESS OF COMMANDERS AND DEPLOYED 
            UNITS TO INTELLIGENCE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED BY THE 
            INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Coordination of operational intelligence support for the 
        commanders of the combatant commands and deployed units of the 
        Armed Forces has proven to be inadequate.
            (2) Procedures used to reconcile information among various 
        intelligence community and Department of Defense data bases have 
        proven to be inadequate and, being inadequate, have diminished 
        the usefulness of that information and have precluded commanders 
        and planners within the Armed Forces from fully benefiting from 
        key information that should have been available to them.
            (3) Excessive compartmentalization of responsibilities and 
        information within the Department of Defense and the other 
        elements of the intelligence community has resulted in 
        inaccurate analysis of important intelligence material.
            (4) Excessive restrictions on the distribution of 
        information within the executive branch have disadvantaged units 
        of the Armed Forces that would have benefited most from the 
        information.
            (5) Procedures used in the Department of Defense to ensure 
        that critical intelligence information is provided to the right 
        combat units in a timely manner failed during the Persian Gulf 
        War and, as a result, information about potential chemical 
        weapons storage locations did not reach the units that 
        eventually destroyed those storage areas.
            (6) A recent, detailed review of the events leading to and 
        following the destruction of chemical weapons by members of the 
        Armed Forces at Khamisiyah, Iraq, during the Persian Gulf War 
        has revealed a number of inadequacies in the way the Department 
        of Defense and the other elements of the intelligence community 
        handled, distributed, recorded, and stored intelligence 
        information about the threat of exposure of United States forces 
        to chemical weapons and the toxic agents in those weapons.
            (7) The inadequacy of procedures for recording the receipt 
        of, and reaction to, intelligence reports provided by the 
        intelligence community to combat units of the Armed Forces 
        during the Persian Gulf War has caused it to be impossible to 
        analyze the failures in transmission of intelligence-related 
        information on the location of chemical weapons at Khamisiyah, 
        Iraq, that resulted in the demolition of chemical weapons by 
        members of the Armed Forces unaware of the hazards to which they 
        were exposed.

    (b) Report Requirement.--Not later than March 1, 1998, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to Congress a report that identifies the 
specific actions that have been taken or are being taken to ensure that 
there is adequate coordination of access of commanders of the combatant 
commands and deployed units of the Armed Forces to intelligence 
collected and analyzed by the intelligence community.

imagery intelligence, or geospatial information.''.
    (2) Section 467(4) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (A) by inserting ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (A);
            (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking out ``and geodetic 
        data; and'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``geodetic data, and 
        related products.''; and

departments and agencies of the Federal Government involved in such 
matters.

of Defense.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the Defense 
Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office of the Department of Defense

prisoners of war and missing persons (as defined in chapter 76 of title 
10, United States Code) in analyzing cases involving such persons.

        presence of United States military forces in Okinawa.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1886]]

        regions'' as one of the so-called ``wild card'' scenarios 
        covered in the review.

        infrastructure for forward basing of forces and alternatives to 
        the existing international agreements that provide for basing of 
        United States forces in foreign countries; and
            (2) because the Pacific Rim continues to emerge as a region 
        of significant economic and military importance to the United 
        States, a continued presence of the Armed Forces in that region 
        is vital to the capability of the United States to timely 
        protect its interests in the region.

    (c) Report Required.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate

        will need to station in each region of the world in order to 
        meet the expected or potential future threats to the national 
        security interests of the United States.
            (3) The requirements for access to, and use of, air space 
        and ground maneuver areas in each such region for training for 
        the quantity and types of forces identified for the region 
        pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).
            (4) A list of the international agreements, currently in 
        force, that the United States has entered into with foreign 
        countries regarding the basing of United States forces in those 
        countries and the dates on which the agreements expire.
            (5) A discussion of any anticipated political opposition or 
        other opposition to the renewal of any of those international 
        agreements.
            (6) A discussion of future overseas basing requirements for 
        United States forces, taking into account expected changes in 
        national security strategy, national security environment, and 
        weapons systems.
            (7) The expected costs of maintaining the overseas 
        infrastructure for foreign based forces of the United States, 
        including the costs of constructing any new facilities that will

SEC. 1074. SUSTAINMENT AND OPERATION OF THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress <<NOTE: 10 USC 2281 note.>>  makes the 
following findings:
            (1) The Global Positioning System (consisting of a 
        constellation of satellites and associated facilities capable of 
        providing users on earth with a highly precise statement of 
        their location on earth) makes significant contributions to the 
        attainment of the national security and foreign policy goals of 
        the United States, the safety and efficiency of international 
        transportation, and the economic growth, trade, and productivity 
        of the United States.
            (2) The infrastructure for the Global Positioning System 
        (including both space and ground segments of the infrastructure) 
        is vital to the effectiveness of United States and allied 
        military forces and to the protection of the national security 
        interests of the United States.
            (3) In addition to having military uses, the Global 
        Positioning System has essential civil, commercial, and 
        scientific uses.
            (4) As a result of the increasing demand of civil, 
        commercial, and scientific users of the Global Positioning 
        System--

[[Page 111 STAT. 1908]]

                    (A) there has emerged in the United States a new 
                commercial industry to provide Global Positioning System 
                equipment and related services to the many and varied 
                users of the system; and
                    (B) there have been rapid technical advancements in 
                Global Positioning System equipment and services that 
                have contributed significantly to reductions in the cost 
                of the Global Positioning System and increases in the 
                technical capabilities and availability of the system 
                for military uses.
            (5) It is in the national interest of the United States for 
        the United States--
                    (A) to support continuation of the multiple-use 
                character of the Global Positioning System;
                    (B) to promote broader acceptance and use of the 
                Global Positioning System and the technological 
                standards that facilitate expanded use of the system for 
                civil purposes;
                    (C) to coordinate with other countries to ensure (i) 
                efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum 
                used by the Global Positioning System, and (ii) 
                protection of that spectrum in order to prevent 
                disruption of signals from the system and interference 
                with that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used 
                by the system; and
                    (D) to encourage open access in all international 
                markets to the Global Positioning System and supporting 
                equipment, services, and techniques.

    (b) International <<NOTE: 10 USC 2281 note.>>  Cooperation.--
Congress urges the President to promote the security of the United 
States and its allies, the public safety, and commercial interests by 
taking the following steps:
            (1) Undertaking a coordinated effort within the executive 
        branch to seek to establish the Global Positioning System, and 
        augmentations to the system, as a worldwide resource.
            (2) Seeking to enter into international agreements to 
        establish signal and service standards that protect the Global 
        Positioning System from disruption and interference.
            (3) Undertaking efforts to eliminate any barriers to, and 
        other restrictions of foreign governments on, peaceful uses of 
        the Global Positioning System.
            (4) Requiring that any proposed international agreement 
        involving nonmilitary use of the Global Positioning System or 
        any augmentation to the system not be agreed to by the United 
        States unless the proposed agreement has been reviewed by the 
        Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
        Transportation, and the Secretary of Commerce (acting as the 
        Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board 
        established by Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-6, dated 
        March 28, 1996).

    (c) Fiscal Year 1998 Prohibition of Support of Foreign System.--None 
of the funds authorized to be appropriated under this Act may be used to 
support the operation and maintenance or enhancement of a satellite 
navigation system operated by a foreign country.
    (d) In General.--(1) Part IV of subtitle A of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by inserting after chapter 134 the following new

SEC. 1084. COMMENDATION <<NOTE: 10 USC note prec. 1121.>>  OF MEMBERS OF 
            THE ARMED FORCES AND GOVERNMENT CIVILIAN PERSONNEL WHO 
            SERVED DURING THE COLD WAR; CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) During the period of the Cold War, from the end of World 
        War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the 
        United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a global military 
        rivalry.
            (2) This rivalry, potentially the most dangerous military 
        confrontation in the history of mankind, has come to a close 
        without a direct superpower military conflict.
            (3) Military and civilian personnel of the Department of 
        Defense, personnel in the intelligence community, members of the 
        foreign service, and other officers and employees of the United 
        States faithfully performed their duties during the Cold War.
            (4) Many such personnel performed their duties while 
        isolated from family and friends and served overseas under 
        frequently arduous conditions in order to protect the United 
        States and achieve a lasting peace.
            (5) The discipline and dedication of those personnel were 
        fundamental to the prevention of a superpower military conflict.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1920]]

    (b) Congressional Commendation.--The Congress hereby commends the 
members of the Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Government who 
contributed to the historic victory in the Cold War and expresses its 
gratitude and appreciation for their service and sacrifices.
    (c) Certificates of Recognition.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
prepare a certificate recognizing the Cold War service of qualifying 
members of the Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Department of 
Defense and other Government agencies contributing to national security, 
as determined by the Secretary, and shall provide the certificate to 
such members and civilian personnel upon request.

SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GRANTING OF STATUTORY FEDERAL CHARTERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the practice of providing by 
statute Federal charters to certain nonprofit organizations--
            (1) may be perceived as implying a Government imprimatur of 
        approval of those organizations; and
            (2) may mistakenly lead to public perception that the United 
        States ensures the integrity and worthiness of those 
        organizations.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that because of the perceived implicit Government 
        imprimatur of approval conveyed by enactment of a Federal 
        charter for an organization, such a charter should be granted 
        only in the rarest and most extraordinary cases; and
            (2) that no statutory Federal charter should be enacted 
        after the enactment of this Act unless the charter is approved 
        by Congress upon favorable report by the committees of 
        jurisdiction of the respective Houses.

SEC. 1086. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING MILITARY VOTING RIGHTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) members of the Armed Forces have a fundamental right to 
        vote in Federal, State, and local elections; and
            (2) an extended absence of a member of the Armed Forces from 
        the place of the member's residency or domicile due to military 
        or naval orders is not of itself grounds to consider the 
        member's residency or domicile as lost or changed.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, should 
review how best to protect the right of members of the Armed Forces to 
vote in Federal, State, and local elections while taking into account 
the right of States to prescribe requirements for voter registration. 
Such a review should include an assessment of challenges to military 
voting rights and consideration of possible legislative remedies to 
ensure that, for purposes of voting in Federal, State, and local 
elections, a member of the Armed Forces who is absent from a State in 
compliance with military or naval orders is not, solely by reason of 
that absence, considered to have lost or changed residency or domicile.

SEC. 1087. DESIGNATION OF BOB HOPE AS AN HONORARY VETERAN OF THE ARMED 
            FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 111 STAT. 1921]]

            (1) In its more than 200 years of existence as a nation, the 
        United States has never conferred on any person the status of 
        being an honorary veteran of the Armed Forces of the United 
        States.
            (2) Status as an honorary veteran of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States is and should remain an extraordinary honor not 
        lightly conferred nor frequently granted.
            (3) The lifetime of accomplishments and service of Leslie 
        Townes (Bob) Hope on behalf of members of the Armed Forces of 
        the United States fully justifies the conferring of that status.
            (4) Bob Hope attempted to enlist in the Armed Forces to 
        serve his country during World War II but was informed that the 
        greatest service he could provide his country was as a civilian 
        entertainer for the troops.
            (5) During World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam 
        War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Cold War, Bob Hope travelled 
        to visit and entertain millions of members of the Armed Forces 
        in numerous countries, on ships at sea, and in combat zones 
        ashore.
            (6) Bob Hope has been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, 
        the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Distinguished Service 
        Medal of each of the branches of the Armed Forces and more than 
        100 other citations and awards from national veterans service 
        organizations and civic and humanitarian organizations.
            (7) Bob Hope has given unselfishly of himself for over half 
        a century to be with American service members on foreign shores, 
        working tirelessly to bring a spirit of humor and cheer to 
        millions of service members during their loneliest moments, and 
        has, thereby, extended to them for the American people a touch 
        of home away from home.

    (b) Designation of Bob Hope as Honorary Veteran.--
Congress--
            (1) extends its gratitude, on behalf of the American people, 
        to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope, of the State of California, for his 
        lifetime of accomplishments and service on behalf of members of 
        the Armed Forces of the United States; and
            (2) hereby confers upon him the status of being an honorary 
        veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States.

SEC. 1088. FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION OF AVIATION INSURANCE PROGRAM.

    (a) Extension.--Section 44310 of title 49, United States Code, is

    Subtitle A--United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina

SEC. 1201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) United States Armed Forces were deployed to the Republic 
        of Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) Implementation Force (IFOR) to implement the 
        military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
            (2) The military aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement have 
        been successfully implemented to date with the military forces 
        of the warring factions successfully separated and a cessation 
        in the hostilities that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of 
        thousands of Bosnians.
            (3) Implementation of the civil aspects of the Dayton Peace 
        Agreement has lagged far behind the schedule for such 
        implementation envisioned in the Agreement with the result that 
        United States Armed Forces have undertaken a prolonged 
        engagement in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
            (4) On December 13, 1995, the President stated in a letter 
        to Congress, ``NATO and U.S. military commanders believe, and I 
        expect, that the military mission can be accomplished in about a 
        year. Twelve months will allow IFOR time to complete the 
        military tasks assigned in the Dayton agreement and to establish 
        a secure environment, in which political and economic 
        reconstruction efforts by the parties and international civilian 
        agencies can take hold. Within one year, we expect that the 
        military provisions of the Dayton agreement will have been 
        carried out, implementation of the civilian aspects and economic 
        reconstruction will have been firmly launched, free elections 
        will have been held under international supervision and a stable 
        military balance will have been established.''
            (5) Notwithstanding a number of assurances relating to the 
        accomplishment of the military mission in the Republic of Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina by December 1996, the President, on November 15, 
        1996, announced his decision to extend the presence of United 
        States forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
        participate in the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) until June 
        1998.
            (6) Despite initial projections by the Department of Defense 
        that the costs of United States operations in the Republic of 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina would total $1,500,000,000, the projected 
        cost of United States operations in the Republic of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina through June 1998 is estimated to exceed 
        $7,000,000,000.
            (7) The fiscal year 1998 estimate of the Department of 
        Defense for operations in the Republic of Bosnia and

[[Page 111 STAT. 1929]]

        Herzegovina assumes that the level of military forces 
        participating in SFOR will be reduced soon after the start of 
        the fiscal year.
            (8) The President and the Secretary of Defense have stated 
        that United States forces are to be withdrawn from the Republic 
        of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the end of June 1998.

SEC. 1202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States ground combat forces should not 
        participate in a follow-on force in the Republic of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina after June 1998;
            (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as 
        facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, enables 
        the Western European Union, with the consent of the North 
        Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and strategic 
        direction of NATO assets made available for the Alliance, may be 
        an ideal instrument for a follow-on force for the Republic of 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina;
            (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United 
        States ground combat forces in the Republic of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina may be suitable for a follow-on force for the 
        Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina if the European Security and 
        Defense Identity is not sufficiently developed or is otherwise 
        considered inappropriate for such a mission;
            (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate 
        support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on 
        force, including command and control, intelligence, logistics, 
        and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in the region;
            (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of 
        this expression of the sense of Congress and should urge them 
        strongly to undertake preparations for a Western European Union-
        led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-led SFOR 
        if needed to maintain peace and stability in the Republic of 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina; and
            (6) the President should consult with the Congress with 
        respect to any support to be provided to a Western European 
        Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force in the Republic of Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998.

SEC. 1203. <<NOTE: 10 USC 114 note.>>  WITHDRAWAL OF UNITED STATES 
            GROUND FORCES FROM REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA .

    (a) Limitation.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made available 
for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1998 or any subsequent 
fiscal year may be used for the deployment of any United States ground 
combat forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 
1998, unless the President, not later than May 15, 1998, and after 
consultation with the bipartisan leadership of the two Houses of 
Congress, transmits to Congress a certification--
            (1) that the continued presence of United States ground 
        combat forces, after June 30, 1998, in the Republic of Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina is required in order to meet the national 
        security interests of the United States; and
            (2) that after June 30, 1998, it will remain United States 
        policy that United States ground forces will not serve as, or be 
        used as, civil police in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1930]]

    (b) Report.--The <<NOTE: President.>>  President shall submit with 
the certification under subsection (a) a report that includes the 
following:
            (1) The reasons why that presence is in the national 
        security interest of the United States.
            (2) The number of United States military personnel to be 
        deployed in and around the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        and other areas of the former Yugoslavia after that date.
            (3) The expected duration of any such deployment.
            (4) The mission and objectives of the United States Armed 
        Forces to be deployed in and around the Republic of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina and other areas of the former Yugoslavia after June 
        30, 1998.
            (5) The exit strategy of such forces.
            (6) The incremental costs associated with any such 
        deployment.
            (7) The effect of such deployment on the morale, retention, 
        and effectiveness of United States armed forces.
            (8) A description of the forces from other nations involved 
        in a follow-on mission, shown on a nation-by-nation basis.
            (9) A description of the command and control arrangement 
        established for United States forces involved in a follow-on 
        mission.
            (10) An assessment of the expected threats to United States 
        forces involved in a follow-on mission.
            (11) The plan for rotating units and personnel to and from 
        the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during a follow-on 
        mission, including the level of participation by reserve 
        component units and personnel.
            (12) The mission statement and operational goals of the 
        United States forces involved in a follow-on mission.

    (c) Request for Supplemental Appropriations.--The President shall 
transmit to Congress with a certification under subsection (a) a 
supplemental appropriations request for the Department of Defense for 
such amounts as are necessary for the costs of any continued deployment 
beyond June 30, 1998.
    (d) Construction With President's Constitutional Authority.--Nothing 
in this section shall be deemed to restrict the authority of the 
President under the Constitution to protect the lives of United States 
citizens.
    (e) Construction With Appropriations Provision.--The provisions of 
this section are enacted, and shall be applied, as supplemental to (and 
not in lieu of) the provisions of section 8132 of the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105-56).

            (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including 
        personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) 
        that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to 
        multinational military activities worldwide.

    (b) Authorities To Encourage Actions by United States Allies.--In 
seeking the actions described in subsection (a) with respect to any 
nation, or in response to a failure by any nation to undertake one or

        agreement the United States has with that nation, consistent 
        with the terms of such agreement.
            (5) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment or other 
        appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United States 
        bilateral assistance appropriated for that nation.
            (6) Take any other action the President determines to be 
        appropriate as authorized by law.

    (c) Report on Progress in Increasing Allied Burdensharing.--Not 
later than March 1, 1998, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report on--
            (1) steps taken by other nations to complete the actions 
        described in subsection (a);

SEC. 1222. TEMPORARY USE OF GENERAL PURPOSE VEHICLES AND NONLETHAL 
            MILITARY EQUIPMENT UNDER ACQUISITION AND CROSS SERVICING 
            AGREEMENTS.

    Section 2350(1) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by 
striking out ``other items'' in the second sentence and all that follows 
through ``United States Munitions List'' and inserting in lieu thereof 
``other nonlethal items of military equipment which are not designated 
as significant military equipment on the United States Munitions List 
promulgated''.

SEC. 1223. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORTS REGARDING FINANCIAL COSTS OF 
            ENLARGEMENT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In a report to Congress in February 1997 on the 
        rationale, benefits, costs, and implications of North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization enlargement the Secretary of Defense 
        estimated that the financial cost to the United States of such 
        enlargement will be modest, totaling between $2,000,000,000 and 
        $2,600,000,000 for the period from 1997 through 2009.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1938]]

            (2) A study by the RAND Corporation published in 1996 
        calculated that the total financial cost to the United States of 
        such enlargement will be between $5,000,000,000 and 
        $6,000,000,000 over the same period.
            (3) A March 1996 report by the Congressional Budget Office 
        on the financial costs of enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization alliance estimated the United States share of 
        alliance enlargement costs to be between $4,800,000,000 and 
        $18,900,000,000 through 2010, depending upon political 
        developments in Europe.
            (4) An August 1997 report by the General Accounting Office 
        reviewing the financial cost estimates of the Secretary of 
        Defense concluded that North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        enlargement could entail additional costs beyond those included 
        in the Secretary's estimate and questioned the validity of the 
        Secretary's estimate due to the lack of supporting cost 
        documentation and the inclusion of cost elements not related to 
        NATO enlargement.
            (5) The North Atlantic Alliance is scheduled to complete its 
        analysis of the military requirements for the integration of 
        Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into the Alliance in 
        December 1997.
            (6) The North Atlantic Alliance is also scheduled to 
        complete in December 1997 its financial cost estimate of the 
        military requirements related to the integration of those 
        nations.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
analysis of the North Atlantic Alliance of the military requirements 
relating to NATO enlargement and of the financial costs to the Alliance 
of NATO enlargement will be one of the major factors in the 
consideration by the Senate of the ratification of instruments to 
approve the admission of new member nations to the Alliance and by 
Congress for the authorization and appropriation of the funding for the 
costs associated with such enlargement.
    (c) Report Assessing NATO Cost Analysis.--Not later than March 31, 
1998, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report 
providing--
            (1) an assessment of the analysis by the North Atlantic 
        Alliance of the military requirements related to NATO 
        enlargement and of the estimate of the financial costs to the 
        NATO Alliance for the integration of Poland, the Czech Republic, 
        and Hungary into the Alliance;
            (2) a description of the analytical means used to determine 
        such requirements and costs; and
            (3) a general assessment of the additional military 
        requirements and costs that would result from a significantly 
        increased threat.

    (d) Report on Department of Defense Costs.--(1) The Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to Congress, in conjunction with the submission of 
the President's budget for fiscal year 1999, a report on Department of 
Defense costs for NATO enlargement. The report shall include a detailed 
estimate of such costs for fiscal year 1998 that identifies all 
appropriations, by budget activity, for the military departments and 
other elements of the Department of Defense to support NATO enlargement.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall include in the budget 
justification materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary in 
support of the budget of Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999

[[Page 111 STAT. 1939]]

complete and detailed descriptions and estimates of the amounts provided 
in that budget for the costs of NATO enlargement.

SEC. 1224. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ENLARGEMENT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
            TREATY ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) met on 
        July 8 and 9, 1997, in Madrid, Spain, and issued invitations to 
        the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland to begin accession talks 
        to join NATO.
            (2) Congress has expressed its support for the process of 
        NATO enlargement by approving the NATO Enlargement Facilitation 
        Act of 1996 (title VI of the matter enacted in section 101(c) of 
        division A of Public Law 104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note).
            (3) The United States has supported the position that the 
        process of enlarging NATO will continue after the first round of 
        invitations in July 1997.
            (4) Romania and Slovenia are to be commended for their 
        progress toward political and economic reform and appear to be 
        striving to meet the guidelines for prospective membership in 
        NATO.
            (5) In furthering the purpose and objective of NATO in 
        promoting stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area, 
        NATO should invite Romania and Slovenia to accession 
        negotiations to become NATO members as expeditiously as possible 
        upon the satisfaction of all relevant membership criteria and 
        consistent with NATO security objectives.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization should be commended--
            (1) for having committed to review the process of enlarging 
        the Organization in 1999; and
            (2) for singling out the positive developments toward 
        democracy and rule of law in Romania and Slovenia.

SEC. 1225. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO LEVEL OF UNITED STATES MILITARY 
            PERSONNEL IN THE EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The stability of the Asia-Pacific region is a matter of 
        vital national interest affecting the well-being of all 
        Americans.
            (2) The nations of the Pacific Rim collectively represent 
        the United States largest trading partner and are expected to 
        account for almost one-third of the world's economic activity by 
        the start of the next century.
            (3) The increased reliance by the United States on trade and 
        Middle East oil sources has reinforced United States security 
        interests in the Southeast Asia shipping lanes through the South 
        China Sea and the key straits of Malacca, Sunda, Lombok, and 
        Makassar.
            (4) The South China Sea is an important area for United 
        States Navy ships passing from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean 
        and the Persian Gulf.
            (5) Maintaining freedom of navigation in the South China Sea 
        is an important interest of the United States.
            (6) The threats of proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction, the emerging nationalism amidst long-standing 
        ethnic

[[Page 111 STAT. 1940]]

        and national rivalries, and the unresolved territorial disputes 
        combine to create a political landscape of potential instability 
        and conflict in this region that could jeopardize the interests 
        of the United States and the safety of United States nationals.
            (7) A critical component of the East Asia strategy of the 
        United States is maintaining forward deployed forces in Asia to 
        ensure broad regional stability, to help to deter aggression, to 
        lessen the pressure for arms races, and to contribute to the 
        political and economic advances of the region from which the 
        United States benefits.
            (8) The forward presence of the United States in Northeast 
        Asia enables the United States to respond to regional 
        contingencies, to protect sea lines of communication, to sustain 
        influence, and to support operations as distant as operations in 
        the Persian Gulf.
            (9) The military forces of the United States serve to 
        prevent the political or economic control of the Asia-Pacific 
        region by a rival, hostile power or coalition of such powers, 
        thus preventing any such group from obtaining control over the 
        vast resources, enormous wealth, and advanced technology of the 
        region.
            (10) Allies of the United States in the region can base 
        their defense planning on a reliable American security 
        commitment, a reduction of which could stimulate an arms buildup 
        in the region.
            (11) The Joint Announcement of the United States-Japan 
        Security Consultative Committee of December 1996, acknowledged 
        that ``the forward presence of U.S. forces continues to be an 
        essential element for pursuing our common security objectives''.
            (12) The United States and Japan signed the United States-
        Japan Security Declaration in April 1996, in which the United 
        States reaffirmed its commitment to maintain this level of 
        100,000 United States military personnel in the region.
            (13) The United States military presence is recognized by 
        the nations of the region as serving stability and enabling 
        United States engagement.
            (14) The nations of East Asia and the Pacific consider the 
        commitment of the forces of the United States to be so vital to 
        their future that they scrutinize actions of the United States 
        for any sign of weakened commitment to the security of the 
        region.
            (15) The reduction of forward-based military forces could 
        negatively affect the ability of the United States to contribute 
        to the maintenance of peace and stability of the Asia and 
        Pacific region.
            (16) Recognizing that while the United States must consider 
        the overall capabilities of its forces in its decisions to 
        deploy troops, nevertheless any reduction in the number of 
        forward-based troops may reduce the perception of American 
        capability and commitment in the region that cannot be 
        completely offset by modernization of the remaining forces.
            (17) During time of crisis, deployment of forces to East 
        Asia, even though such forces were previously removed from the 
        area, might be deemed to be an act of provocation that

[[Page 111 STAT. 1941]]

        could be used as a pretext by a hostile power for armed 
        aggression within the region, and the existence of that 
        possibility might hinder such a deployment.
            (18) Proposals to reduce the forward presence of the United 
        States in the East Asia region or subordinate security interests 
        to United States domestic budgetary concerns can erode the 
        perception of the commitment of the United States to its 
        alliances and interests in the region.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should maintain at least approximately 100,000 United States 
military personnel in the East Asia and Pacific region until such time 
as there is a peaceful and permanent resolution to the major security 
and political conflicts in the region.

        or war, including programs to place weapons in space or to 
        develop earth-based weapons capable of attacking space-based 
        systems.
            (9) Trends that would lead the People's Republic of China 
        toward the development of advanced intelligence, surveillance,

[[Page 111 STAT. 1942]]

        and reconnaissance capabilities, including gaining access to 
        commercial or third-party systems with military significance.
            (10) Efforts by the People's Republic of China to develop 
        highly accurate and stealthy ballistic and cruise missiles, 
        including sea-launched cruise missiles, particularly in numbers 
        sufficient to conduct attacks capable of overwhelming projected 
        defense capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.
            (11) Development by the People's Republic of China of 
        command and control networks, particularly those capable of 
        battle management of long-range precision strikes.
            (12) Efforts by the People's Republic of China in the area 
        of telecommunications, including common channel signaling and 
        synchronous digital hierarchy technologies.
            (13) Development by People's Republic of China of advanced 
        aerospace technologies with military applications (including gas 
        turbine ``hot section'' technologies).

            (15) Exploitation by the People's Republic of China for 
        military purposes of the Global Positioning System or other 
        similar systems (including commercial land surveillance 
        satellites), with such analysis and forecasts focusing 
        particularly on indications of an attempt to increase the 
        accuracy of weapons or situational awareness of operating 
        forces.
            (16) Development by the People's Republic of China of

not later than March 15, 1998.

SEC. 1227. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NEED FOR RUSSIAN OPENNESS ON THE 
            YAMANTAU MOUNTAIN PROJECT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The United States and Russia have been working since the 
        end of the Cold War to achieve a strategic relationship based on 
        cooperation and openness between the two nations.
            (2) This effort to establish a new strategic relationship 
        between the two nations has resulted in the conclusion or

[[Page 111 STAT. 1943]]

        agreement in principle on a number of far-reaching agreements, 
        including START I, II, and III, a revision in the Conventional 
        Forces in Europe Treaty, and a series of other agreements (such 
        as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons 
        Convention), designed to further reduce bilateral threats and 
        limit the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
            (3) These far-reaching agreements were based on the 
        understanding between the United States and Russia that there 
        would be a good faith effort on both sides to comply with the 
        letter and spirit of the agreements.
            (4) Reports indicate that Russia has been pursuing 
        construction of a massive underground facility of unknown 
        purpose at Yamantau Mountain and the city of Mezhgorye (formerly 
        the settlements of Beloretsk-15 and Beloretsk-16) that is 
        designed to survive a nuclear war and appears to exceed 
        reasonable defense requirements.
            (5) The Yamantau Mountain project does not appear to be 
        consistent with the lowering of strategic threats, openness, and 
        cooperation that is the basis of the post-Cold War strategic 
        partnership between the United States and Russia.
            (6) The United States has allowed senior Russian military 
        and government officials to have access to key strategic 
        facilities of the United States by providing tours of the North 
        American Air Defense (NORAD) command at Cheyenne Mountain and 
        the United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) headquarters in 
        Omaha, Nebraska, among other sites, and by providing extensive 
        briefings on the operations of those facilities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Russian 
government--
            (1) should provide to the United States Government a written 
        explanation with sufficient detail (including drawings and 
        diagrams) of the purpose and operational concept of the 
        completed and planned facilities at Yamantau Mountain to support 
        a high confidence judgment by the United States that the design 
        of the Yamantau facility is consistent with official Russian 
        government explanations; and
            (2) should allow a United States delegation, to include 
        officials of the executive branch and Members of Congress, to 
        have access to the Yamantau Mountain project and buildings and 
        facilities surrounding the project.

SEC. 1228. ASSESSMENT OF THE CUBAN THREAT TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL 
            SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cuba has maintained a hostile policy in its relations 
        with the United States for over 35 years.
            (2) The United States, as a sovereign nation, must be able 
        to respond to any Cuban provocation and defend the people and 
        territory of the United States against any attack.
            (3) In 1994, the Government of Cuba callously encouraged a 
        massive exodus of Cubans, by boat and raft, toward the United 
        States during which countless numbers of those Cubans lost their 
        lives on the high seas.
            (4) The humanitarian response of the United States to 
        rescue, shelter, and provide emergency care to those Cubans,

[[Page 111 STAT. 1944]]

        together with the actions taken to absorb some 30,000 of those 
        Cubans into the United States, required significant efforts and 
        the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs 
        incurred by the United States and State and local governments in 
        connection with those efforts.
            (5) On February 24, 1996, Cuban MiG aircraft attacked and 
        destroyed, in international airspace, two unarmed civilian 
        aircraft flying from the United States, and the four persons in 
        those unarmed civilian aircraft were killed.
            (6) Since that attack, the Cuban government has issued no 
        apology for the attack, nor has it indicated any intention to 
        conform its conduct to international law that is applicable to 
        civilian aircraft operating in international airspace.

    (b) Review and Assessment.--The Secretary of Defense shall carry out 
a comprehensive review and assessment of--
            (1) Cuban military capabilities; and
            (2) the threats to the national security of the United 
        States that may be posed by Cuba, including--
                    (A) such unconventional threats as (i) encouragement 
                of massive and dangerous migration, and (ii) attacks on 
                citizens and residents of the United States while they 
                are engaged in peaceful protest in international waters 
                or airspace;
                    (B) the potential for development and delivery of 
                chemical or biological weapons; and
                    (C) the potential for internal strife in Cuba that 
                could involve citizens or residents of the United States 
                or the Armed Forces of the United States.

    (c) Report.--Not later than March 31, 1998, the Secretary of Defense 
shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a report 
on the review and assessment. The report shall include the following:
            (1) The Secretary's assessment of the capabilities and 
        threats referred to in subsection (b), including each of the 
        threats described in paragraph (2) of that subsection.
            (2) A discussion of the results of the review and 
        assessment, including an assessment of the contingency plans 
        developed by the Secretary to counter any threat posed by Cuba 
        to the United States.

    (d) Consultation on Review and Assessment.--In performing the review 
and assessment and in preparing the report, the Secretary of Defense 
shall consult with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
commander of the United States Southern Command, and the heads of other 
appropriate departments and agencies of the United States.

SEC. 1229. REPORT ON HELSINKI JOINT STATEMENT.

<<NOTE: President.>>     (a) Requirement.--Not later than March 31, 
1998, the President shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of 
the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of 
Representatives a report on the Helsinki Joint Statement on future 
reductions in nuclear forces. The report shall address the United States 
approach (including verification implications) to implementing the 
Helsinki Joint Statement, in particular, as that Statement relates to 
the following:
            (1) Lower aggregate levels of strategic nuclear warheads.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1945]]

            (2) Measures relating to the transparency of strategic 
        nuclear warhead inventories and the destruction of strategic 
        nuclear warheads.
            (3) Deactivation of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.
            (4) Measures relating to nuclear long-range sea-launched 
        cruise missiles and tactical nuclear systems.
            (5) Issues related to transparency in nuclear materials.

    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``Helsinki 
Joint Statement'' means the agreements between the President of the 
United States and the President of the Russian Federation as contained 
in the Joint Statement on Parameters on Future Reductions in Nuclear 
Forces issued at Helsinki in March 1997.

SEC. 1230. COMMENDATION OF MEXICO ON FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On July 6, 1997, elections were conducted in Mexico in 
        order to fill 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 32 seats in 
        the 128 seat Senate, the office of the Mayor of Mexico City, and 
        local elections in a number of Mexican States.
            (2) For the first time, the federal elections were organized 
        by the Federal Electoral Institute, an autonomous and 
        independent organization established under the Mexican 
        Constitution.
            (3) More than 52,000,000 Mexican citizens registered to 
        vote.
            (4) Eight political parties registered to participate in 
        those elections, including the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
        (PRI), the National Action Party (PAN), and the Democratic 
        Revolutionary Party (PRD).
            (5) Since 1993, Mexican citizens have had the exclusive 
        right to participate as observers in activities related to the 
        preparation and the conduct of elections.
            (6) Since 1994, Mexican law has permitted international 
        observers to be a part of the election process.
            (7) With 84 percent of the ballots counted, PRI candidates 
        received 38 percent of the vote for seats in the Chamber of 
        Deputies, while PRD and PAN candidates received 52 percent of 
        the combined vote.
            (8) PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano has become 
        the first elected Mayor of Mexico City, a post previously 
        appointed by the President.
            (9) PAN members will now serve as governors in seven of 
        Mexico's 31 States.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the recent elections in Mexico were conducted in a free, 
        fair, and impartial manner;
            (2) the will of the Mexican people, as expressed through the 
        ballot box, has been respected by President Ernesto Zedillo and 
        officials throughout his administration; and
            (3) President Zedillo, the Mexican Government, the Federal 
        Electoral Institute of Mexico, the political parties and 
        candidates, and most importantly the citizens of Mexico should 
        all be congratulated for their support and participation in 
        these very historic elections.

SEC. 1231. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CAMBODIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 111 STAT. 1946]]

            (1) During the 1970s and 1980s, Cambodia was wracked by 
        political conflict, war, and violence, including genocide 
        perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.
            (2) The 1991 Paris Agreements on a Comprehensive Political 
        Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict set the stage for a process 
        of political accommodation and national reconciliation among 
        Cambodia's warring parties.
            (3) The international community engaged in a massive effort 
        involving more than $2,000,000,000 to ensure peace, democracy, 
        and prosperity in Cambodia following the Paris Accords.
            (4) The Cambodian people clearly demonstrated their support 
        for democracy when 90 percent of eligible Cambodian voters 
        participated in United Nations-sponsored elections in 1993.
            (5) Since the 1993 elections, Cambodia has made economic 
        progress, as shown by the recent decision of the Association of 
        Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to extend membership in the 
        Association to Cambodia.
            (6) Tensions within the ruling Cambodian coalition have 
        erupted into violence.
            (7) In March 1997, 19 Cambodians were killed and more than 
        100 were wounded in a grenade attack on political demonstrators 
        supportive of the Funcinpec and the Khmer Nation Party.
            (8) During June 1997, fighting erupted in Phnom Penh between 
        forces loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh and Second 
        Prime Minister Hun Sen.
            (9) On July 5, 1997, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen deposed 
        the First Prime Minister in a violent coup d'etat.
            (10) Forces loyal to Hun Sen have executed former Interior 
        Minister Ho Sok and approximately 40 other political opponents 
        loyal to Prince Ranariddh.
            (11) Democracy and stability in Cambodia are threatened by 
        the continued use of violence and other extralegal means to 
        resolve political tensions.
            (12) In response to the July 1997 coup in Cambodia referred 
        to in paragraph (9)--
                    (A) the <<NOTE: President.>>  President has 
                suspended all direct assistance to the Cambodian 
                Government; and
                    (B) the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
                (ASEAN) has decided to delay indefinitely admission of 
                Cambodia to membership in the Association.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the parties in Cambodia should immediately cease the use 
        of violence;
            (2) the United States should take all necessary steps to 
        ensure the safety of United States citizens in Cambodia;
            (3) the United States should call an emergency meeting of 
        the United Nations Security Council to consider all options to 
        restore peace and democratic governance in Cambodia;
            (4) the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian 
        Nations should work together to take immediate steps to restore 
        democracy and the rule of law in Cambodia;
            (5) United States assistance to the Government of Cambodia 
        should remain suspended until violence ends, the democratically 
        elected Government is restored to power, and the

[[Page 111 STAT. 1947]]

        necessary steps have been taken to ensure that the elections 
        scheduled for 1998 take place; and
            (6) the United States should take all necessary steps to 
        encourage other donor nations to suspend assistance as part of a 
        multilateral effort.

SEC. 1232. CONGRATULATING GOVERNOR CHRISTOPHER PATTEN OF HONG KONG.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) His Excellency Christopher F. Patten, the former 
        Governor of Hong Kong, was the twenty-eighth and last British 
        Governor of the dependent territory of Hong Kong before that 
        territory reverted back to the People's Republic of China on 
        July 1, 1997.
            (2) Christopher Patten was a superb administrator and an 
        inspiration to the people whom he governed.
            (3) During Christopher Patten's five years as Governor of 
        Hong Kong, the economy flourished under his stewardship, growing 
        by more than 30 percent in real terms.
            (4) Christopher Patten presided over a capable and honest 
        civil service.
            (5) During the tenure of Christopher Patten as Governor of 
        Hong Kong, common crime declined and the political climate was 
        positive and stable.
            (6) The legacy of Christopher Patten to Hong Kong is the 
        expansion of democracy in Hong Kong's legislative council and a 
        tireless devotion to the rights, freedoms, and welfare of the 
        people of Hong Kong.
            (7) Christopher Patten fulfilled the commitment of the 
        British Government to ``put in place a solidly based democratic 
        administration'' in Hong Kong before July 1, 1997.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
Christopher F. Patten, the last British Governor of the dependent 
territory of Hong Kong--
            (1) served his country with great honor and distinction in 
        that capacity; and
            (2) deserves special thanks and recognition from the United 
        States for his tireless efforts to develop and nurture democracy 
        in Hong Kong.

SEC. 1301. PRESIDENTIAL REPORT CONCERNING DETARGETING OF RUSSIAN 
            STRATEGIC MISSILES.

    (a) Required Report.--Not later than January 1, 1998, the President 
shall submit to Congress a report concerning detargeting of Russian 
strategic missiles. The report shall address each of the following:
            (1) Whether a Russian ICBM that was formerly, but is no 
        longer, targeted at a site in the United States would be 
        automatically retargeted at a site in the United States in the 
        event of the accidental launch of the missile.
            (2) Whether missile detargeting would prevent or 
        significantly reduce the possibility of an unauthorized missile 
        launch carried out by the Russian General Staff and prevent or 
        significantly reduce the consequences to the United States of 
        such a launch.
            (3) Whether missile detargeting would pose a significant 
        obstacle to an unauthorized launch carried out by an operational 
        level below the Russian General Staff if missile operators at 
        such an operational level acquired missile launch codes or had 
        the technical expertise to override missile launch codes.
            (4) The plausibility of an accidental launch of a Russian 
        ICBM, compared to the possibility of a deliberate missile 
        launch, authorized or unauthorized, resulting from Russian 
        miscalculation, overreaction, or aggression.
            (5) The national security benefits derived from detargeting 
        United States and Russian ICBMs.
            (6) The relative consequences to the United States of an 
        unauthorized or accidental launch of a Russian ICBM that has 
        been detargeted and one that has not been detargeted.

    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of subsection (a):
            (1) The term ``Russian ICBM'' means an intercontinental 
        ballistic missile of the Russian Federation.
            (2) The term ``accidental launch'' means a missile launch 
        resulting from mechanical failure.

        adequacy of the provisions contained in the agreement for 
        monitoring and verifying compliance of Russia with the terms of 
        the agreement and, based upon that assessment, the determination 
        of the President specifically as to whether the procedures for 
        monitoring and verification of compliance by Russia with the 
        terms of the agreement are adequate or inadequate.
            (D) A <<NOTE: President.>>  determination by the President 
        as to whether the deactivations to occur under the agreement 
        will be carried out in a symmetrical, reciprocal, or equivalent 
        manner and whether the agreement will require early 
        deactivations of strategic forces by the United States to be 
        carried out substantially more rapidly than deactivations of 
        strategic forces by Russia.
            (E) An assessment <<NOTE: President.>>  by the President of 
        the effect of the proposed early deactivation on the stability 
        of the strategic balance and relative strategic nuclear 
        capabilities of the United States and the Russian Federation at 
        various stages during deactivation and upon completion, 
        including a determination by the President specifically as to 
        whether the proposed early deactivations will adversely affect 
        strategic stability.

purpose if in the report under subsection (c)(3) the President 
determines any of the following:
            (A) That procedures for monitoring and verification of 
        compliance by Russia with the terms of the agreement are 
        inadequate.
            (B) That the agreement will require early deactivations of 
        strategic forces by the United States to be carried out 
        substantially more rapidly than deactivations of strategic 
        forces by Russia.
            (C) That the proposed early deactivations will adversely 
        affect strategic stability.

    (2) The limitation in paragraph (1), if effective by reason of a 
determination by the President described in paragraph (1)(B),

[[Page 111 STAT. 1950]]

shall cease to apply 30 days after the date on which the President 
notifies Congress that the early deactivations under the agreement are 
in the national interest of the United States.
    (e) Contingency Plan for Sustainment of Systems.--(1) Not later then 
February 15, 1998, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a 
plan for the sustainment beyond October 1, 1999, of United States 
strategic nuclear delivery systems and alternative Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty force structures in the event that a strategic arms 
reduction agreement subsequent to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty 
does not enter into force before 2004.
    (2) The plan shall include a discussion of the following matters:
            (A) The actions that are necessary to sustain the United 
        States strategic nuclear delivery systems, distinguishing 
        between the actions that are planned for and funded in the 
        future-years defense program and the actions that are not 
        planned for and funded in the future-years defense program.
            (B) The funding necessary to implement the plan, indicating 
        the extent to which the necessary funding is provided for in the 
        future-years defense program and the extent to which the 
        necessary funding is not provided for in the future-years 
        defense program.

SEC. 1305. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7274p.>>  ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS 
            REGARDING THE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED 
            STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on 
        earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on 
        nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using 
        weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of the 
        nuclear weapons stockpile are essential to ensure its 
        credibility as a deterrent.
            (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the 
        Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
            (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States is 
        prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water Development 
        Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 U.S.C. 2121 
        note) from conducting underground nuclear tests ``unless a 
        foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this date, at which 
        time the prohibition on United States nuclear testing is 
        lifted''.
            (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) 
        requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and support a 
        program to assure that the United States is in a position to 
        maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect 
        of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the 
        event that a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban on nuclear 
        explosive testing is negotiated and ratified.''.
            (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 
        note) required the President to submit an annual report to 
        Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the 
        safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing 
        United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile 
        Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.
            (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to assure 
        that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under a test 
        ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our confidence 
        in the safety, reliability, and the performance of our 
        weapons''. This decision was incorporated in a Presidential 
        Directive.
            (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) 
        also requires that the Secretary of Energy establish a 
        ``stewardship program to ensure the preservation of the core 
        intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in 
        nuclear weapons''.
            (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the 
        safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons 
        stockpile is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management 
        Program. The ability of the United States to maintain and 
        certify the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability

[[Page 111 STAT. 1953]]

        of the nuclear weapons stockpile without testing will require 
        utilization of new and sophisticated computational capabilities 
        and diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current 
        diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are 
        insufficient to certify the safety and reliability of the United 
        States nuclear weapons stockpile into the future. Whereas in the 
        past laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction 
        with nuclear testing, in the future they will provide, under the 
        Department of Energy's stockpile stewardship plan, the sole 
        basis for assessing past test data and for making judgments on 
        phenomena observed in connection with the aging of the 
        stockpile.
            (9) Section 3159 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201; 42 U.S.C. 7274o) 
        requires that the directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories 
        and the nuclear weapons production plants submit a report to the 
        Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs if they 
        identify a problem that has significant bearing on confidence in 
        the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon 
        type, that the Assistant Secretary must transmit that report, 
        along with any comments, to the congressional defense committees 
        and to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense, and 
        that the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council advise Congress regarding 
        its analysis of any such problems.
            (10) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the 
        establishment of a new annual reporting and certification 
        requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe and 
        reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.
            (11) On the same day, the President noted that the Secretary 
        of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the responsibility, 
        after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the 
        Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, and the 
        Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to provide the 
        President with the information regarding the certification 
        referred to in paragraph (10).
            (12) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by

                hostile foreign leadership with access to strategic 
                nuclear forces from acting against the vital interests 
                of the United States;
                    (B) the United States should continue to maintain 
                nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to 
                implement an effective and robust deterrent strategy; 
                and
                    (C) the advice of the persons required to provide 
                the President and Congress with assurances of the 
                safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the 
                nuclear weapons force should be scientifically based, 
                without regard for politics, and of the highest quality 
                and integrity.

    (c) Addition of President to Recipients of Reports by Heads of

SEC. 1307. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNITED 
            STATES OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION AND 
            ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Chemical Weapons Convention requires the destruction 
        of the United States stockpile of lethal chemical agents and 
        munitions by April 29, 2007 (not later than 10 years after the 
        Convention's entry into force).
            (2) The President has substantial authority under existing 
        law to ensure that--
                    (A) the technologies necessary to destroy the 
                stockpile are developed;
                    (B) the facilities necessary to destroy the 
                stockpile are constructed; and
                    (C) Federal, State, and local environmental laws and 
                regulations do not impair the ability of the United 
                States to comply with its obligations under the 
                Convention.
            (3) The Comptroller General has concluded (in GAO Report 
        NSIAD 97018 of February 1997) that--
                    (A) obtaining the necessary Federal and State 
                permits that are required under Federal environmental 
                laws and regulations for building and operating the 
                chemical agents and munitions destruction facilities is 
                among the most unpredictable factors in the chemical 
                demilitarization program; and

[[Page 111 STAT. 1956]]

                    (B) program cost and schedule are largely driven by 
                the degree to which States and local communities are in 
                agreement with proposed disposal methods and whether 
                those methods meet environmental concerns.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President--
            (1) should use the authority of the President under existing 
        law to ensure that the United States is able to construct and 
        operate the facilities necessary to destroy the United States 
        stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions within the 
        time allowed by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and
            (2) while carrying out the obligations of the United States 
        under the Convention, should encourage negotiations between 
        appropriate Federal officials and officials of the State and 
        local governments concerned to attempt to meet their concerns 
        regarding compliance with Federal and State environmental laws 
        and regulations and other concerns about the actions being taken 
        to carry out those obligations.

    (c) Chemical Weapons Convention Defined.--For the purposes of this 
section, the terms ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' and ``Convention'' 
mean the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, 
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, 
ratified by the United States on April 25, 1997, and entered into force 
on April 29, 1997.

SEC. 1308. EXTENSION OF COUNTERPROLIFERATION AUTHORITIES FOR SUPPORT OF 
            UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL COMMISSION ON IRAQ.

    Section 1505 of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Control Act of 1992 
(title XV of Public Law 102-484; 22 U.S.C. 5859a) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (d)(3), by striking out ``or'' after 
        ``fiscal year 1996,'' and by inserting ``, or $15,000,000 for 
        fiscal year 1998'' before the period at the end; and
            (2) in subsection (f), by striking out ``1997'' and 
        inserting in lieu thereof ``1998''.

SEC. 1309. <<NOTE: 10 USC 113 note.>>  ANNUAL REPORT ON MORATORIUM ON 
            USE BY ARMED FORCES OF ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has stated its support for a ban on 
        antipersonnel landmines that is global in scope and verifiable.
            (2) On <<NOTE: Korea.>>  May 16, 1996, the President 
        announced that the United States, as a matter of policy, would 
        eliminate its stockpile of non-self-destructing antipersonnel 
        landmines, except those used for training purposes and in Korea, 
        and that the United States would reserve the right to use self-
        destructing antipersonnel landmines in the event of conflict.
            (3) On May 16, 1996, the President also announced that the 
        United States would lead an effort to negotiate an international 
        treaty permanently banning the use of all antipersonnel 
        landmines.
            (4) The United States is currently participating at the 
        United Nations Conference on Disarmament in negotiations aimed 
        at achieving a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.

[[Page 111 STAT. 1957]]

            (5) On August 18, 1997, the <<NOTE: Canada.>>  
        administration agreed to participate in international 
        negotiations sponsored by Canada (the so-called ``Ottawa 
        process'') designed to achieve a treaty that would outlaw the 
        production, use, and sale of antipersonnel landmines.
            (6) On <<NOTE: Norway.>>  September 17, 1997, the President 
        announced that the United States would not sign the 
        antipersonnel landmine treaty concluded in Oslo, Norway, by 
        participants in the Ottawa process because the treaty would not 
        provide a geographic exception to allow the United States to 
        stockpile and use antipersonnel landmines in Korea or an 
        exemption that would preserve the ability of the United States 
        to use mixed antitank mine systems which could be used to deter 
        an armored assault against United States forces.
            (7) The <<NOTE: Korea.>>  President also announced a change 
        in United States policy whereby the United States--
                    (A) would no longer deploy antipersonnel landmines, 
                including self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, by 
                2003, except in Korea;
                    (B) would seek to field alternatives by that date, 
                or by 2006 in the case of Korea;
                    (C) would undertake a new initiative in the United 
                Nations Conference on Disarmament to establish a global 
                ban on the transfer of antipersonnel landmines; and
                    (D) would increase its current humanitarian demining 
                activities around the world.
            (8) The President's decision would allow the continued use 
        by United States forces of self-destructing antipersonnel 
        landmines that are used as part of a mixed antitank mine system.
            (9) Under existing law (as provided in section 580 of Public 
        Law 104-107; 110 Stat. 751), on February 12, 1999, the United 
        States will implement a one-year moratorium on the use of 
        antipersonnel landmines by United States forces except along 
        internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized 
        zones within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by 
        military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the 
        exclusion of civilians.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should not implement a moratorium on 
        the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States Armed Forces 
        in a manner that would endanger United States personnel or 
        undermine the military effectiveness of United States Armed 
        Forces in executing their missions; and
            (2) the United States should pursue the development of 
        alternatives to self-destructing antipersonnel landmines.

    (c) Annual Report.--Not later than December 31 each year, the 
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees a report concerning antipersonnel landmines. Each such report 
shall include the Secretary's description of the following:
            (1) The military utility of the continued deployment and use 
        by the United States of antipersonnel landmines.
            (2) The effect of a moratorium on the production, 
        stockpiling, and use of antipersonnel landmines on the ability 
        of United States forces to deter and defend against attack on 
        land by hostile forces, including on the Korean peninsula.
            (3) Progress in developing and fielding systems that are 
        effective substitutes for antipersonnel landmines, including an

[[Page 111 STAT. 1958]]

        identification and description of the types of systems that are 
        being developed and fielded, the costs associated with those 
        systems, and the estimated timetable for developing and fielding 
        those systems.
            (4) The effect of a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel 
        landmines on the military effectiveness of current antitank mine 
        systems.
            (5) The number and type of pure antipersonnel landmines that 
        remain in the United States inventory and that are subject to 
        elimination under the President's September 17, 1997, 
        declaration on United States antipersonnel landmine policy.
            (6) The number and type of mixed antitank mine systems that 
        are in the United States inventory, the locations where they are 
        deployed, and their effect on the deterrence and warfighting 
        ability of United States Armed Forces.
            (7) The effect of the elimination of pure antipersonnel 
        landmines on the warfighting effectiveness of the United States 
        Armed Forces.
            (8) The costs already incurred and anticipated of 
        eliminating antipersonnel landmines from the United States 
        inventory in accordance with the policy enunciated by the 
        President on September 17, 1997.
            (9) The benefits that would result to United States military 
        and civilian personnel from an international treaty banning the 
        production, use, transfer, and stockpiling of antipersonnel 
        landmines.

        savings attributable to the 1995 base closure round.

SEC. 2825. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING UTILIZATION OF SAVINGS DERIVED FROM 
            BASE CLOSURE PROCESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Since 1988, the Department of Defense has conducted four 
        rounds of closures and realignments of military installations in 
        the United States, resulting in the closure of 97 installations.
            (2) The cost of carrying out the closure or realignment of 
        installations covered by such rounds is estimated by the 
        Secretary of Defense to be $23,000,000,000.
            (3) The savings expected as a result of the closure or 
        realignment of such installations are estimated by the Secretary 
        to be $10,300,000,000 through fiscal year 1996 and 
        $36,600,000,000 through 2001.
            (4) In addition to such savings, the Secretary has estimated 
        recurring savings as a result of the closure or realignment of 
        such installations of approximately $5,600,000,000 annually.
            (5) The fiscal year 1997 budget request for the Department 
        assumed a savings of between $2,000,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 
        as a result of the closure or realignment of such installations, 
        which savings were to be dedicated to the

[[Page 111 STAT. 2001]]

        modernization of the Armed Forces. The savings assumed in the 
        budget request were not realized.
            (6) The fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Department 
        assumes a savings of $5,000,000,000 as a result of the closure 
        or realignment of such installations, which savings are to be 
        dedicated to the modernization of the Armed Forces.

    (b) Sense of Senate on Use of Savings Resulting From Base Closure 
Process.--It is the sense of the Senate that the savings identified in 
the report under section 2824 should be made available to the Department 
of Defense solely for purposes of the modernization of new weapon 
systems (including research, development, test, and evaluation relating 
to such modernization) and should be used by the Department solely for 
such purposes.

    (c) Reversionary Interest.--If the Secretary of the Navy determines 
at any time that real property located at Naval Station, Long Beach, 
California, and conveyed under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment

is otherwise being used by COSCO in violation of such subsection, all 
right, title, and interest in and to the property shall revert to the 
United States, and the United States shall have immediate right of entry 
thereon.
    (d) National Security Report and Determination.--Not later than 30 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Defense and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall 
separately submit to the President and the congressional defense 
committees a report regarding the potential national security 
implications of conveying property described in subsection (a) to COSCO. 
Each report shall specifically identify any increased risk of espionage, 
arms smuggling, or other illegal activities that could result from a 
conveyance to COSCO and recommend appropriate action to address any such 
risk.
    (e) Waiver Authority.--(1) The President may waive the prohibitions 
contained in this section with respect to a conveyance of property

at the end the following:
    ``(e)(1) For the purposes of this section and except as otherwise 
provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the gross tonnage 
of a vessel shall be the gross tonnage that would have been recognized 
by the Secretary on July 1, 1997, as the tonnage measured under section 
14502 of this title, or as an alternate tonnage measured under section 
14302 of this title as prescribed by the Secretary under section 14104 
of this title.
    ``(2)(A) The Secretary may waive the application of paragraph (1) to 
a tank vessel if--

        for the waiver before January 1, 1998;
            ``(ii) the Secretary determines that--
                    ``(I) the owner of the tank vessel has entered into 
                a binding agreement to alter the tank vessel in a 
                shipyard in the United States to reduce the gross 
                tonnage of the tank vessel by converting a portion of 
                the cargo tanks of the tank vessel into protectively 
                located segregated ballast tanks; and
                    ``(II) that conversion will result in a significant 
                reduction in the risk of a discharge of oil;
            ``(iii) at least 60 days before the date of the issuance of 
        the waiver, the Secretary--
                    ``(I) publishes notice that the Secretary has 
                received the application and made the determinations 
                required by clause (ii), including a description of the 
                agreement entered into pursuant to clause (ii)(I); and
                    ``(II) provides an opportunity for submission of 
                comments regarding the application; and
            ``(iv) the alterations referred to in clause (ii)(I) are 
        completed before the later of--
                    ``(I) the date by which the first special survey of 
                the tank vessel is required to be completed after the 
                date of the enactment of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998; or
                    ``(II) July 1, 1999.

    ``(B) A waiver under subparagraph (A) shall not be effective after 
the expiration of the 3-year period beginning on the first date on which 
the tank vessel would have been prohibited by subsection (c) from 
operating if the alterations referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) were 
not made.

[[Page 111 STAT. 2078]]

    ``(3) This subsection does not apply to a tank vessel that, before 
July 1, 1997, had undergone, or was the subject of a contract for,
