Public Law 105-36
105th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To reauthorize and amend the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, and 
       for other purposes. <<NOTE:  Aug. 5, 1997 -  [H.R. 709]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: National 
Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1997.>> 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 43 USC 31a note.>> 

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Geologic Mapping 
Reauthorization Act of 1997''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 43 USC 31a note.>> 

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in enacting the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 
        (43 U.S.C. 31a et seq.), Congress found, among other things, 
        that--
                    (A) during the 2 decades preceding enactment of that 
                Act, the production of geologic maps had been 
                drastically curtailed;
                    (B) geologic maps are the primary data base for 
                virtually all applied and basic earth-science 
                investigations;
                    (C) Federal agencies, State and local governments, 
                private industry, and the general public depend on the 
                information provided by geologic maps to determine the 
                extent of potential environmental damage before 
                embarking on projects that could lead to preventable, 
                costly environmental problems or litigation;
                    (D) the lack of proper geologic maps has led to the 
                poor design of such structures as dams and waste-
                disposal facilities;
                    (E) geologic maps have proven indispensable in the 
                search for needed fossil fuel and mineral resources; and
                    (F) a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic 
                mapping is required in order to systematically build the 
                Nation's geologic-map data base at a pace that responds 
                to increasing demand;
            (2) the geologic mapping program called for by that Act has 
        not been fully implemented; and
            (3) it is time for this important program to be fully 
        implemented.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENT.
