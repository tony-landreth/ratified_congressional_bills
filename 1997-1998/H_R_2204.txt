          TITLE V--ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR JONES ACT WAIVERS

SEC. 501. <<NOTE: 46 USC 12106 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) current coastwise trade laws provide no administrative 
        authority to waive the United-States-built requirement of those 
        laws for the limited carriage of passengers for hire on vessels 
        built or rebuilt outside the United States;
            (2) requests for such waivers require the enactment of 
        legislation by the Congress;
            (3) each Congress routinely approves numerous such requests 
        for waiver and rarely rejects any such request; and
            (4) the review and approval of such waiver requests is a 
        ministerial function which properly should be executed by an 
        administrative agency with appropriate expertise.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 46 USC 12106 note.>>  ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVER OF 
            COASTWISE TRADE LAWS.

    Notwithstanding sections 12106 and 12108 of title 46, United States 
Code, section 8 of the Act of June 19, 1886 (46 U.S.C. App. 289), and 
section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (46

[[Page 112 STAT. 3446]]

U.S.C. App. 883), the Secretary of Transportation may issue a 
certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for employment 
in the coastwise trade as a small passenger vessel or an uninspected 
passenger vessel for an eligible vessel authorized to carry no more than 
12 passengers for hire if the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity 
for public comment, determines that the employment of the vessel in the 
coastwise trade will not adversely affect--
            (1) United States vessel builders; or
            (2) the coastwise trade business of any person who employs 
        vessels built in the United States in that business.

SEC. <<NOTE: 46 USC 12106 note.>>  503. REVOCATION.

    The Secretary may revoke an endorsement issued under section 502, 
after notice and an opportunity for public comment, if the Secretary 
determines that the employment of the vessel in the coastwise trade has 
substantially changed since the issuance of the endorsement, and--
            (1) the vessel is employed other than as a small passenger 
        vessel or an uninspected passenger vessel; or
            (2) the employment of the vessel adversely affects--
                    (A) United States vessel builders; or
                    (B) the coastwise trade business of any person who

 TITLE <<NOTE: Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act 
of 1998.>>  VI--HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND HYPOXIA

SEC. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1451 note.>>  601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia 
Research and Control Act of 1998''.

SEC. <<NOTE: 16 USC 1451 note.>>  602. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria 
        piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one 
        example of potentially harmful algal blooms composed of 
        naturally occurring species that reproduce explosively and that 
        are increasing in frequency and intensity in the Nation's 
        coastal waters;
            (2) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms include 
        red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast; brown tides 
        in New York and Texas; ciguatera fish poisoning in Hawaii, 
        Florida, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands; and 
        shellfish poisonings in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific 
        Northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska;
            (3) in certain cases, harmful algal blooms have resulted in 
        fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West Indian 
        manatees, beach and shellfish bed closures, threats to public 
        health and safety, and concern among the public about the safety 
        of seafood;
            (4) according to some scientists, the factors causing or 
        contributing to harmful algal blooms may include excessive 
        nutrients in coastal waters, other forms of pollution, the 
        transfer of harmful species through ship ballast water, and 
        ocean currents;
            (5) harmful algal blooms may have been responsible for an 
        estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past 
        decade;
            (6) harmful algal blooms and blooms of non-toxic algal 
        species may lead to other damaging marine conditions such as 
        hypoxia (reduced oxygen concentrations), which are harmful or 
        fatal to fish, shellfish, and benthic organisms;
            (7) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration in the Department of Commerce, 53 percent of 
        United States estuaries experience hypoxia for at least part of 
        the year and a 7,000 square mile area in the Gulf of Mexico off 
        Louisiana and Texas suffers from hypoxia;
            (8) according to some scientists, a factor believed to cause 
        hypoxia is excessive nutrient loading into coastal waters;
            (9) there is a need to identify more workable and effective 
        actions to reduce nutrient loadings to coastal waters;
            (10) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
        through its ongoing research, education, grant, and coastal 
        resource management programs, possesses a full range of 
        capabilities necessary to support a near and long-term 
        comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and control harmful 
        algal blooms and hypoxia;
            (11) funding for the research and related programs of the 
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will aid in 
        improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities for

[[Page 112 STAT. 3448]]

        addressing the human and environmental costs associated with 
        harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and
            (12) other Federal agencies such as the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the 
        National Science Foundation, along with the States, Indian 
        tribes, and local governments, conduct important work related to 
        the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal blooms 
        and hypoxia.
