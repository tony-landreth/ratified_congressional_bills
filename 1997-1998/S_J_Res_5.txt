Public Law 105-5
105th Congress

                            Joint Resolution


 
  Waiving certain provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 relating to the 
appointment of the United States Trade Representative. <<NOTE: Mar. 17, 
                        1997 -  [S.J. Res. 5]>> 

Whereas paragraph (3) of section 141(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
    U.S.C. 2171(b)(3)) became effective on January 1, 1996, and provides 
    certain limitations with respect to the appointment of the United 
    States Trade Representative and Deputy United States Trade 
    Representatives;
Whereas paragraph (3) of section 141(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 does 
    not apply to any individual who was serving as the United States 
    Trade Representative or Deputy United States Trade Representative on 
    the effective date of such paragraph (3) and who continued to serve 
    in that position;
Whereas Charlene Barshefsky was appointed Deputy United States Trade 
    Representative on May 28, 1993, with the advice and consent of the 
    Senate, and was serving in that position on January 1, 1996;
Whereas paragraph (3) of section 141(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 does 
    not apply to Charlene Barshefsky in her capacity as Deputy United 
    States Trade Representative; and
Whereas in light of the foregoing, it is appropriate to continue to 
    waive the provisions of paragraph (3) of section 141(b) of the Trade 
    Act of 1974 with respect to the appointment of Charlene Barshefsky 
    as the United States Trade Representative: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress <<NOTE: 19 USC 2171 note.>>  assembled, 
That notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3) of section 141(b) 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171(b)(3)) or any other provision 
of law, the President, acting by and with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, is authorized to appoint Charlene Barshefsky as the United 
States Trade Representative.

    Approved March 17, 1997.
