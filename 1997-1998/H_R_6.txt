            Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking and Illegal Alcohol 
            Consumption. 20 USC 1011h.>> 

    ``(a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the `Collegiate 
Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking and Illegal Alcohol Consumption'.
    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, in an 
effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, 
all institutions of higher education should carry out the following:
            ``(1) The president of the institution should appoint a task 
        force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, 
        Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full 
        examination of student and academic life at the institution. The 
        task force should make recommendations for a broad range of 
        policy and program changes that would serve to reduce alcohol 
        and other drug-related problems. The institution should provide 
        resources to assist the task force in promoting the campus 
        policies and proposed environmental changes that have been 
        identified.
            ``(2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities 
        for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to 
        engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure 
        activities.
            ``(3) The institution should enforce a `zero tolerance' 
        policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at the 
        institution.
            ``(4) The institution should vigorously enforce the 
        institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who 
        violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or other 
        drug-related problems should be referred for assistance, 
        including on-campus counseling programs if appropriate.
            ``(5) The institution should adopt a policy to discourage 
        alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities. 
        It should adopt policies limiting the advertisement and 
        promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus.
            ``(6) The institution should work with the local community, 
        including local businesses, in a `Town/Gown' alliance to 
        encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and to 
        address illegal alcohol use by students.

``SEC. 350. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1067.>> 

    ``Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support 
        the technological and economic competitiveness of the United 
        States by improving and expanding the scientific and 
        technological capacity of the United States. More and better 
        prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed 
        to improve and expand such capacity.
            ``(2) As the Nation's population becomes more diverse, it is 
        important that the educational and training needs of all 
        Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science 
        and technological fields diminishes our Nation's competitiveness 
        by impairing the quantity of well prepared scientists, 
        engineers, and technical experts in these fields.
            ``(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority 
        institutions provide an important educational opportunity for 
        minority students, particularly in science and engineering 
        fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address 
        the underrepresentation of minorities in science and 
        technological fields.
            ``(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving 
        science and engineering programs at minority institutions as 
        such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student 
        enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of 
        higher education.''.

        technical skills or their first postsecondary experience, 
        individuals with disabilities, dislocated workers, individuals 
        making the transition from welfare-to-work, and individuals who 
        are limited by time and place constraints can benefit from 
        nontraditional, noncampus-based postsecondary education 
        opportunities and appropriate support services.

        based education opportunities is great, as is the need for skill 
        competency credentials and other measures of educational 
        progress and attainment that are valid and widely accepted, but 
        neither need is likely to be adequately addressed by the

prorated based on the percentage of such asset developed or purchased 
with Federal reserve funds, which property shall be used in the 
operation of the program authorized by this part, as provided in 
subsection (d). The Secretary may restrict or regulate the use of such 
asset only to the extent necessary to reasonably protect the Secretary's 
prorated share of the value of such asset. The Secretary may direct a 
guaranty agency, or such agency's officers or directors, to cease any 
activity involving expenditures, use, or transfer of the Federal Fund 
administered by the guaranty agency that the Secretary determines is a 
misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure of the Federal Fund or 
the Secretary's share of such asset.

        each guaranty agency may transfer not more than 180 days' cash

        payments) as a working capital reserve as defined in

        Standards) from the Federal Fund for deposit into the Operating 
        Fund for use in the performance of the guaranty agency's duties 
        under this part. Such transfers may occur during the first 3 
        years following the establishment of the Operating Fund. 
        However, no agency may transfer in excess of 45 percent of the 
        balance, as of September 30, 1998, of the agency's Federal Fund 
        to the agency's Operating Fund during such 3-year period. In 
        determining the amount that may be transferred, the agency shall 
        ensure that sufficient funds remain in the Federal Fund to pay 
        lender claims within the required time periods and to meet the 
        reserve recall requirements of this section and subsections (h) 
        and (i) of section 422.

        Operating Fund during the first 3 years after the date of 
        enactment of this section if the guaranty agency demonstrates to 
        the Secretary that--

                negative without the transfer of such interest; and

                substantially improve the financial circumstances of the 
                guaranty agency.

        begin repayment of sums transferred pursuant to this subsection 
        not later than the start of the fourth year after the 
        establishment of the Operating Fund, and shall repay all amounts 
        transferred not later than 5 years from the date of the 
        establishment of the Operating Fund. With respect to amounts 
        transferred from the Federal Fund, the guaranty agency shall not 
        be required to repay any interest on the funds transferred and 
        subsequently repaid. The guaranty agency shall provide to the 
        Secretary a reasonable schedule for repayment of the sums 
        transferred and an annual financial analysis demonstrating the 
        agency's ability to comply with the schedule and repay all 
        outstanding sums transferred.
            ``(4) Prohibition.--If a guaranty agency transfers funds 
        from the Federal Fund in accordance with this section, and fails 
        to make scheduled repayments to the Federal Fund, the agency may 
        not receive any other funds under this part until the Secretary 
        determines that the agency has made such repayments. The 
        Secretary shall pay to the guaranty agency any funds withheld in 
        accordance with this paragraph immediately upon making the 
        determination that the guaranty agency has made all such 
        repayments.

                only with respect to repayment of interest that was 
                transferred in accordance with paragraph (2); and
                    ``(B) waive paragraph (4);

        are extenuating circumstances (such as State constitutional 
        prohibitions) beyond the control of the agency that justify such 
        a waiver.

                    TITLE V--DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONS

SEC. 501. ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW TITLE V.

    Title V (20 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:

                   ``TITLE V--DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONS

                 ``PART A--HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS

``SEC. 501. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; AND PROGRAM AUTHORITY. <<NOTE: 20 USC 
            1101.>> 

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) Hispanic Americans are at high risk of not enrolling 
        or graduating from institutions of higher education.
            ``(2) Disparities between the enrollment of non-Hispanic 
        white students and Hispanic students in postsecondary education 
        are increasing. Between 1973 and 1994, enrollment of white 
        secondary school graduates in 4-year institutions of higher 
        education increased at a rate two times higher than that of 
        Hispanic secondary school graduates.

[[Page 112 STAT. 1766]]

            ``(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, 
        Hispanic-serving institutions provide a significant proportion 
        of postsecondary opportunities for Hispanic students.
            ``(4) Relative to other institutions of higher education, 
        Hispanic-serving institutions are underfunded. Such institutions 
        receive significantly less in State and local funding, per full-
        time equivalent student, than other institutions of higher 
        education.
            ``(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are succeeding in 
        educating Hispanic students despite significant resource 
        problems that--
                    ``(A) limit the ability of such institutions to 
                expand and improve the academic programs of such 
                institutions; and
                    ``(B) could imperil the financial and administrative 
                stability of such institutions.
            ``(6) There is a national interest in remedying the 
        disparities described in paragraphs (2) and (4) and ensuring 
        that Hispanic students have an equal opportunity to pursue 
        postsecondary opportunities.

    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to--
            ``(1) expand educational opportunities for, and improve the 
        academic attainment of, Hispanic students; and
            ``(2) expand and enhance the academic offerings, program 
        quality, and institutional stability of colleges and 
        universities that are educating the majority of Hispanic college 
        students and helping large numbers of Hispanic students and 
        other low-income individuals complete postsecondary degrees.

    ``(c) Program Authority.--The Secretary shall provide grants and 
related assistance to Hispanic-serving institutions to enable such 
institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Hispanic 
students and other low-income individuals.

        potential distribution of subsidies to students through an 
        income-contingent repayment option.
            (5) The effect on the simplicity of the program, including 
        the effect of the plan on the regulatory burden on students, 
        institutions, lenders, and other program participants.
            (6) The effect on investment in human capital and resources, 
        loan servicing capability, and the quality of service to the 
        borrower.
            (7) The effect on the diversity of lenders, including 
        community-based lenders, originating and secondary market 
        lenders.
            (8) The effect on program integrity.
            (9) The degree to which the mechanism will provide market 
        incentives to encourage continuous improvement in the delivery 
        and servicing of loans.
            (10) The availability of loans to students by region, income 
        level, and by categories of institutions.
            (11) The proposed Federal and State role in the operation of 
        the mechanism.
            (12) A description of how the mechanism will be administered

        large student loan portfolios of basing lender yield on either 
        the 30-day or 90-day commercial paper rate or the LIBOR while 
        continuing to base the borrower rate on the 91-day Treasury

            INSTITUTIONS WITH FEW STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS.

    (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of Education shall conduct a 
study of the effectiveness of cohort default rates as an indicator of 
administrative capability and program quality for institutions of higher 
education at which less than 15 percent of students eligible to borrow 
participate in the Federal student loan programs under title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 and fewer than 30 borrowers enter repayment 
in any fiscal year. At a minimum, the study shall include--

        and of the student populations the institutions serve;
            (2) analysis of cohort default rates as indicators of 
        administrative shortcomings and program quality at the 
        institutions;
            (3) analysis of the effectiveness of cohort default rates as 
        a means to prevent fraud and abuse in the programs assisted 
        under such title;
            (4) analysis of the extent to which the institutions with 
        high cohort default rates are no longer participants in the 
        Federal student loan programs under such title; and
            (5) analysis of the costs incurred by the Department of 
        Education for the calculation, publication, correction, and 
        appeal of cohort default rates for the institutions in relation 
        to any benefits to taxpayers.

    (b) Consultation.--In conducting the study described in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of Education shall consult with institutions of

  PART C <<NOTE: Community Scholarship Mobilization Act.>> --COMMUNITY 
SCHOLARSHIP MOBILIZATION

SEC. 811. SHORT TITLE. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1070 note.>> 

    This part may be cited as the ``Community Scholarship Mobilization 
Act''.

SEC. 812. FINDINGS. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1070 note.>> 

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the local community, when properly organized and 
        challenged, is one of the best sources of academic support, 
        motivation toward achievement, and financial resources for 
        aspiring postsecondary students;
            (2) local communities, working to complement or augment 
        services currently offered by area schools and colleges, can 
        raise the educational expectations and increase the rate of 
        postsecondary attendance of their youth by forming locally-based 
        organizations that provide both academic support (including 
        guidance, counseling, mentoring, tutoring, encouragement, and 
        recognition) and tangible, locally raised, effectively targeted, 
        publicly recognized, financial assistance;
            (3) proven methods of stimulating these community efforts 
        can be promoted through Federal support for the establishment of 
        regional, State, or community program centers to organize and 
        challenge community efforts to develop educational incentives 
        and support for local students; and
            (4) using Federal funds to leverage private contributions to 
        help students from low-income families attain educational and 
        career goals is an efficient and effective investment of scarce 
        taxpayer-provided resources.

PART D--GRANTS TO STATES FOR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY TRANSITION TRAINING 
                    FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH OFFENDERS

SEC. 821. <<NOTE: 20 USC 1151.>> GRANTS TO STATES FOR WORKPLACE AND 
            COMMUNITY TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH 
            OFFENDERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are 
        incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and 
        prisons.
            (2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been 
        sentenced as first-time adult felons.
            (3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high 
        school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have 
        little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.
            (4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only 
        through grade 10.
            (5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of 
        crime into productive citizenship with available educational, 
        vocational, work skills, and related service programs.
            (6) If not involved with educational programs while 
        incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a life 
        of crime upon release.
            (7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is 
        about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique 
        opportunity for education and training.
            (8) Even with quality education and training provided during 
        incarceration, a period of intense supervision, support, and

pursuit of a postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of 
arts or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment counseling and 
other related services which start during incarceration and continue 
through prerelease and while on parole.
    (d) Application.--To be eligible for a grant under this section, a 
State correctional education agency shall submit to the Secretary a 
proposal for a youth offender program that--

            (5) describes how the proposed programs are to be integrated 
        with existing State correctional education programs (such as

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the future of our Nation and world will be determined by 
        the young people of today;
            (2) record levels of youth crime, violence, teenage 
        pregnancy, and substance abuse indicate a growing moral crisis 
        in our society;
            (3) character development is the long-term process of 
        helping young people to know, care about, and act upon such 
        basic values as trustworthiness, respect for self and others, 
        responsibility, fairness, compassion, and citizenship;
            (4) these values are universal, reaching across cultural and 
        religious differences;
            (5) a recent poll found that 90 percent of Americans support 
        the teaching of core moral and civic values;
            (6) parents will always be children's primary character 
        educators;
            (7) good moral character is developed best in the context of 
        the family;
            (8) parents, community leaders, and school officials are 
        establishing successful partnerships across the Nation to 
        implement character education programs;
            (9) character education programs also ask parents, faculty, 
        and staff to serve as role models of core values, to provide 
        opportunities for young people to apply these values, and to 
        establish high academic standards that challenge students to set 
        high goals, work to achieve the goals, and persevere in spite of 
        difficulty;
            (10) the development of virtue and moral character, those 
        habits of mind, heart, and spirit that help young people to 
        know, desire, and do what is right, has historically been a 
        primary mission of colleges and universities; and
            (11) the Congress encourages parents, faculty, and staff 
        across the Nation to emphasize character development in the 
        home, in the community, in our schools, and in our colleges and 
        universities.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
should support and encourage character building initiatives in schools 
across America and urge colleges and universities to affirm that the 
development of character is one of the primary goals of higher 
education.

SEC. 864. EDUCATIONAL MERCHANDISE LICENSING CODES OF CONDUCT.

    It is the sense of Congress that all American colleges and 
universities should adopt rigorous educational merchandise licensing 
codes of conduct to assure that university and college licensed 
merchandise is not made by sweatshop and exploited adult or child labor 
either domestically or abroad, and that such codes should include at 
least the following:
            (1) Public reporting of the code and the companies adhering 
        to the code.

[[Page 112 STAT. 1827]]

            (2) Independent monitoring of the companies adhering to the 
        code by entities not limited to major international accounting 
        firms.
            (3) An explicit prohibition on the use of child labor.
            (4) An explicit requirement that companies pay workers at 
        least the governing minimum wage and applicable overtime.
            (5) An explicit requirement that companies allow workers the 
        right to organize without retribution.
            (6) An explicit requirement that companies maintain a safe 
        and healthy workplace.
