        transmission losses from Black River

[[Page 111 STAT. 187]]

        no event shall such transmission losses be more than 10 percent 
        of the Black River or Upper Eagle Creek Wellfield water. Based 
        on this agreement, the Tribe shall not, in any way, impede, 
        restrict, or sue Phelps Dodge regarding the passage of water 
        from the Phelps Dodge Upper Eagle Creek Wellfield, except that--
                    ``(A) Phelps Dodge shall pay to the United States, 
                on behalf of the Tribe, $5,000 per month, with an annual 
                CPI adjustment from July 23, 1997, to account for the 
                passage of such flows; and

                Wellfield, in accordance with paragraphs (2)(E) and 
                (3)(F) above. In the event that a court determines that 
                Phelps Dodge does not have the right to pump the Upper 
                Eagle Creek Wellfield, the Tribe will no longer be 
                subject to the restriction set forth in this

        to Phelps Dodge's prior occupancy and operation of the Black 
        River facilities. The Tribe agrees not to bring any such claims 
        against the United States. The Tribe also agrees that within 30 
        days after Phelps Dodge has vacated the Reservation, it shall 
        dismiss with prejudice the suit that it has filed in Tribal 
        Court against Phelps Dodge (The San Carlos Apache Tribe v. 
        Phelps Dodge, et al., Case No. C-97-118), which such dismissal 
        shall not be considered a decision on the merits, and any claims 
        that it might assert against Phelps Dodge in connection with 
        Phelps Dodge's prior occupancy and operation of the Black River

        year 1994-1995, while median household income rose 82 percent

real property located within a disaster area pursuant to section 1123 of 
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 
(12 U.S.C. 3352), if the agency determines that the exceptions can

from such disaster that outweigh possible adverse effects.
