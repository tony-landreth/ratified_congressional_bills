                    ``(A) in determining reasonable efforts to be made 
                with respect to a child, as described in this paragraph, 
                and in making such reasonable efforts, the child's

                type described in subparagraph (B) is determined to be 
                inconsistent with the permanency plan for the child, 
                reasonable efforts shall be made to place the child in a 
                timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan, 
                and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize 
                the permanent placement of the child;

                subparagraph (B) are not made with respect to a child as 
                a result of a determination made by a court of competent 
                jurisdiction in accordance with subparagraph (D)--

                      section 475(5)(C)) shall be held for the child 
                      within 30 days after the determination; and
                          ``(ii) reasonable efforts shall be made to 
                      place the child in a timely manner in accordance 
                      with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever 
                      steps are necessary to finalize the permanent 
                      placement of the child; and

U.S.C. 675) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(7) The term `legal guardianship' means a judicially 
        created relationship between child and caretaker which is 
        intended to be permanent and self-sustaining as evidenced by the 
        transfer to the caretaker of the following parental rights with 
        respect to the child: protection, education, care and control of 
        the person, custody of the person, and decisionmaking. The term 
        `legal guardian' means the caretaker in such a relationship.''.

                475(5)(E) of the Social Security Act with respect to not 
                less than \1/3\ of such children as the State shall 
                select, giving priority to children for whom the 
                permanency plan (within the meaning of part E of title 
                IV of the Social Security Act) is adoption and children 
                who have been in foster care for the greatest length of 
                time;

        of this subsection, in the case of a State that has a 2-year 
        legislative session, each year of the session is deemed to be a 
        separate regular session of the State legislature.
            (4) Requirements treated as state plan requirements.--For 
        purposes of part E of title IV of the Social Security Act, the

precluding State courts or State agencies from initiating the 
termination of

                children and result in the placement of children in 
                foster care, including through the placement of children 
                with their parents in residential treatment facilities 
                (including residential treatment facilities for post-
                partum depression) that are specifically designed to 
                serve parents and children together in order to promote 
                family reunification and that can ensure the health and 
                safety of the children in such placements.

                submitted, the Secretary shall consider authorizing a 
                demonstration project which is designed to address

        authorize a State to conduct a demonstration project under this 
        section if the State fails to provide health insurance coverage 
        to any child with special needs (as determined under section 
        473(c)) for whom there is in effect an adoption assistance 
        agreement between a State and an adoptive parent or parents.

        conditions of certain court orders.--In considering an 
        application to conduct a demonstration project under this 
        section that has been submitted by a State in which there is in 
        effect a court order determining that the State's child welfare 
        program has failed to comply with the provisions of part B or E 
        of title IV, or with the Constitution of the United States, the 
        Secretary shall take into consideration the effect of approving 
        the proposed project on the terms and conditions of the court 
        order related to the failure to comply.''.

    (b) <<NOTE: 42 USC 1320a-9 note.>>  Rule of Construction.--Nothing 
in the amendment made by subsection (a) shall be construed as affecting 
the terms and conditions of any demonstration project approved under 
section 1130 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-9) before the 
date of the enactment of this Act.

    (c) Authority To Extend Duration of Demonstrations.--Section 1130(d)

        the State agency has documented to the State court a compelling 
        reason for determining that it would not be in the best 
        interests of the child to return home, be referred for 
        termination of parental rights, or be placed for adoption, with 
        a fit and willing relative, or with a legal guardian) placed in

effect upon--

    (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the 
amendments made by this Act take effect on the date of enactment of this 
Act.
    (b) Delay Permitted if State Legislation Required.--In the case of a

which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines requires 
State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in order 
for the plan to meet the additional requirements imposed by the 
amendments made by this Act, the State plan shall not be regarded as 
failing to comply with the requirements of such part solely on the basis 
of the failure of the plan to meet such additional requirements before 
the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of 
the first regular session of the State legislature that begins after the 
date of enactment of this Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in 
the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of 
such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the 
State legislature.
