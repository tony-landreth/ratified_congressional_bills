        International Labor Affairs of the Department of Labor and the

        critical role in preventing and protecting children from the 
        worst forms of child labor, including situations of trafficking, 
        and in reducing the vulnerabilities of men and women to 
        situations of forced labor and trafficking; and
            (3) the Secretary of Labor also plays a critical role in 
        helping other Federal departments and agencies to prevent goods 
        made with forced and child labor from entering the United States 
        by consulting with such departments and agencies to reduce 
        forced and child labor internationally and ensuring that 
        products made by forced labor and child labor in violation of 
        international standards are not imported into the United States.

SEC. 211. <<NOTE: 22 USC 2370c note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The recruitment or use of children in armed conflict is 
        unacceptable for any government or government-supported entity 
        receiving United States assistance.
            (2) The recruitment or use of children in armed conflict, 
        including direct combat, support roles, and sexual slavery, 
        occurred during 2016 or 2017 in Afghanistan, Iran, Mali, Niger, 
        South Sudan, Sudan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
        Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.
            (3) Entities of the Government of Afghanistan, particularly 
        the Afghan Local Police and Afghan National Police, continue to 
        recruit children to serve as combatants or as servants, 
        including as sex slaves.
            (4) Police forces of the Government of Afghanistan 
        participate in counterterrorism operations, direct and indirect 
        combat, security operations, fight alongside regular armies, and 
        are targeted for violence by the Taliban and other opposition 
        groups.
            (5) In February 2016, a 10-year-old boy was assassinated by 
        the Taliban after he had been publicly honored by Afghan local 
        police forces for his assistance in combat operations against 
        the Taliban.
            (6) Recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by 
        government forces has continued in South Sudan with the return 
        to hostilities.
            (7) At least 19,000 children have been recruited since South 
        Sudan's civil war began in 2013.
