Public Law 115-198
115th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: July 20, 2018 -  [H.R. 2061]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: North Korean 
Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2017. 22 USC 7801 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``North Korean Human Rights 
Reauthorization Act of 2017''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 22 USC 7801 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2014, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) 
        on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
        (DPRK) found that the grave human rights violations still being 
        perpetrated against the people of North Korea, due to policies 
        established at the highest level of the state, amount to crimes 
        against humanity. Crimes include forced starvation, sexual 
        violence against women and children, restrictions on freedom of 
        movement, arbitrary detention, torture, executions, and enforced 
        disappearances, among other hardships.
            (2) The COI also noted that the Government of the People's 
        Republic of China is aiding and abetting in crimes against 
        humanity by forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees back to 
        the DPRK. Upon repatriation, North Koreans are sent to prison 
        camps, tortured, or even executed. The Government of the 
        People's Republic of China's forcible repatriation of North 
        Korean refugees violates its obligation to uphold the principle 
        of non-refoulement, under the United Nations Convention Relating 
        to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, 1951 (as made 
        applicable by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
        done at New York January 31, 1967 (19 UST 6223)).
            (3) Estimates from the COI suggest that between 80,000 and 
        120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in political prison 
        camps in North Korea. Another 70,000 are believed to be held at 
        other detention facilities. Prisoners in both situations are 
        subject to harsh conditions, limited food, sexual abuse, and in 
        most cases hard labor.
            (4) One of the findings of the COI report was the 
        persecution of religious minorities, especially Christians. 
        There is effectively no freedom of religion in North Korea, only 
        worship of the Kim family. Christians are subjected to 
        particularly acute persecution. It has been reported that 
        Christians in North Korea have been tortured, forcibly detained, 
        and even executed for possessing a Bible or professing 
        Christianity.

[[Page 132 STAT. 1520]]

            (5) North Korea profits from its human rights abuses. A 2014 
        report from the Asian Institute for Policy Studies suggests that 
        there are nearly 50,000 North Korean workers forced to labor 
        overseas, sometimes without compensation, and for as much as 20 
        hours at a time. Workers that received compensation were not to 
        be paid more than $150 per month, which is between 10 to 20 
        percent of the value of the labor they performed. Based on this 
        report, the regime may profit as much as $360,000,000 annually 
        from just 50,000 laborers.
            (6) On July 6, 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on 
        North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other senior North Korean 
        officials for human rights violations as required by the North 
        Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 
        114-122). This was the first time that the United States had 
        designated North Korean officials for human rights abuses.
            (7) The North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 
        2016 (Public Law 114-122) requires the President to impose 
        mandatory penalties under United States law on any person that 
        ``knowingly engages in, is responsible for, or facilitates 
        serious human rights abuses by the Government of North Korea''.
            (8) Although the United States Refugee Admissions Program 
        remains the largest in the world by far, the United States has 
        only resettled 212 refugees from North Korea since the date of 
        the enactment of the North Korea Human Rights Act of 2004 
        (Public Law 108-333).
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Government should continue to make it 
        a priority to improve information access in North Korea by 
        exploring the use of new and emerging technologies and expanding 
        nongovernmental radio broadcasting to North Korea, including 
        news and information;
            (2) the United Nations has a significant role to play in 
        promoting and improving human rights in North Korea and should 
        press for access for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
        human rights in North Korea as well as the United Nations High 
        Commissioner for Human Rights;
            (3) because North Koreans fleeing into China face a well-
        founded fear of persecution upon their forcible repatriation, 
        the United States should urge China to--
                    (A) immediately halt the forcible repatriation of 
                North Koreans;
                    (B) allow the United Nations High Commissioner for 
                Refugees unimpeded access to North Koreans inside China 
                to determine whether such North Koreans require 
                protection as refugees;
                    (C) fulfill its obligations under the 1951 United 
                Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
                the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 
                and the Agreement on the Upgrading of the UNHCR Mission 
                in the People's Republic of China to UNHCR Branch Office 
                in the People's Republic of China (signed December 1, 
                1995);

[[Page 132 STAT. 1521]]

                    (D) address the concerns of the United Nations 
                Committee against Torture by incorporating the principle 
                of non-refoulement into Chinese domestic legislation; 
                and
                    (E) recognize the legal status of North Korean women 
                who marry or have children with Chinese citizens, and 
                ensure that all such children are granted resident 
                status and access to education and other public services 
                in accordance with Chinese law and international 
                standards;
            (4) the President should continue to designate all 
        individuals found to have committed violations described in 
        section 104(a) of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy 
        Enhancement Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 2914(a)), regarding 
        complicity in censorship and human right abuses;
            (5) the United States currently blocks United States 
        passports from being used to travel to North Korea without a 
        special validation from the Department of State, and the 
        Department of State should continue to take steps to increase 
        public awareness about the risks and dangers of travel by United 
        States citizens to North Korea;
            (6) the United States should continue to seek cooperation 
        from all foreign governments to allow the United Nations High 
        Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) access to process North Korean 
        refugees overseas for resettlement and to allow United States 
        officials access to process refugees for resettlement in the 
        United States (if that is the destination country of the 
        refugees' choosing); and
            (7) the Secretary of State, through diplomacy by senior 
        officials, including United States ambassadors to Asia-Pacific 
        countries, and in close cooperation with South Korea, should 
        make every effort to promote the protection of North Korean 
        refugees and defectors.
