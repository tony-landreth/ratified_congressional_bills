SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The crime of human trafficking involves the exploitation 
        of adults through force, fraud, or coercion, and children for 
        such purposes as forced labor or commercial sex.
            (2) Reliable data on the prevalence of human trafficking in 
        the United States is not available, but cases have been reported 
        in all 50 States, the territories of the United States, and the 
        District of Columbia.
            (3) Each year, thousands of individuals may be trafficked 
        within the United States, according to recent estimates from 
        victim advocates.
            (4) More accurate and comprehensive data on the prevalence 
        of human trafficking is needed to properly combat this form of 
        modern slavery in the United States.
            (5) Victims of human trafficking can include men, women, and 
        children who are diverse with respect to race, ethnicity, and 
        nationality, among other factors.
            (6) Since the enactment of the Trafficking Victims 
        Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386; 114 Stat. 1464), 
        human traffickers have launched increasingly sophisticated 
        schemes to increase the scope of their activities and the number 
        of their victims.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
supports additional efforts to raise awareness of and oppose human 
trafficking.

     TITLE I--FREDERICK DOUGLASS TRAFFICKING PREVENTION ACT OF 2017
