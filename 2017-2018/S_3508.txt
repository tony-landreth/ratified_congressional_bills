SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT TO RESPOND 
                        TO MARINE DEBRIS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the President should--
            (1) support research and development on systems and 
        materials that reduce--
                    (A) derelict fishing gear; and
                    (B) the amount of solid waste that is generated from 
                land-based sources and the amount of such waste that 
                enters the marine environment;
            (2) work with representatives of foreign countries that 
        discharge the largest amounts of solid waste from land-based 
        sources into the marine environment, to develop mechanisms to 
        reduce such discharges;
            (3) carry out studies to determine--
                    (A) the primary means of discharges referred to in 
                paragraph (2);
                    (B) the manner in which waste management 
                infrastructure can be most effective in preventing such 
                discharges; and
                    (C) the long-term impacts of marine debris on the 
                national economies of the countries with which work is 
                undertaken under paragraph (2) and on the global 
                economy, including the impacts of reducing the discharge 
                of such debris;
            (4) work with representatives of the countries with which 
        work is undertaken in paragraph (2) to conclude one or more new 
        international agreements that include provisions--
                    (A) to mitigate the discharge of land-based solid 
                waste into the marine environment; and
                    (B) to provide technical assistance and investment 
                in waste management infrastructure to reduce such 
                discharges, if the President determines such assistance 
                or investment is appropriate; and
            (5) encourage the United States Trade Representative to 
        consider the impact of discharges of land-based solid waste from 
        the countries with which work is conducted under paragraph (2) 
        in relevant future trade agreements.
SEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS SUPPORTING GREAT LAKES LAND-BASED 
                        MARINE DEBRIS ACTION PLAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Great Lakes Land-Based Marine 
Debris Action Plan (NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&R-49) is vital to 
the ongoing efforts to clean up the Great

[[Page 132 STAT. 3744]]

Lakes Region and getting rid of harmful debris, such as microplastics, 
abandoned vessels, and other forms of pollution that are threatening the 
survival of native marine animals and damaging the Great Lakes' 
recreation and tourism economy.

2018''.
SEC. 202. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 29, 2015, the SS El Faro cargo vessel left 
        Jacksonville, Florida bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, carrying 
        391 shipping containers, 294 trailers and cars, and a crew of 33 
        people, including 28 Americans.
            (2) On the morning of October 1, the El Faro sent its final 
        communication reporting that the engines were disabled and the 
        ship was listing, leaving the ship directly in the path of 
        Hurricane Joaquin and resulting in the sinking of the vessel and 
        the loss of all 33 lives.
            (3) The National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast 
        Guard made recommendations to address safety issues, such as 
        improving weather information and training, improving planning 
        and response to severe weather, reviewing the Coast Guard's 
        program delegating vessel inspections to third-party 
        organizations to assess the effectiveness of the program, and

[[Page 132 STAT. 3745]]

        improving alerts and equipment on the vessels, among other 
        recommendations.
            (4) Safety issues are not limited to the El Faro. For 2017, 
        over 21,000 deficiencies were issued to United States commercial 
        vessels and more than 2,500 U.S. vessels were issued ``no-sail'' 
        requirements.
            (5) The maritime industry, particularly the men and women of 
        the United States merchant marine, play a vital and important 
        role to the national security and economy of our country, and a 
        strong safety regime is necessary to ensure the vitality of the 
        industry and the protection of current and future mariners, and 
        to honor lost mariners.
