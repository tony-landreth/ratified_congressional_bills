appropriate, to reduce such barriers.
SEC. 839. DRAWBRIDGES CONSULTATION.

    (a) Consultation.--In addition and subsequent to any rulemaking 
conducted under section 117.8 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, 
related to permanent changes to drawbridge openings that result from 
Amtrak service between New Orleans, Louisiana and Orlando, Florida, the 
Commandant shall consult with owners or operators of rail lines used for 
Amtrak passenger service between New Orleans, Louisiana and Orlando,

schedules necessary to facilitate the On Time Performance of passenger 
trains. These changes to schedules shall not impact Coast Guard response 
times to operational missions.

commencement of Amtrak passenger service on the rail lines between New 
Orleans, Louisiana and Orlando, Florida at the following intervals:
            (1) Not less than 3 months following the commencement of 
        Amtrak passenger service.

of trains described in subsection (a) and that those changes do not 
unreasonably obstruct the navigability of the affected waterways, then 
the Commandant shall submit those findings to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives.

  TITLE IX-- <<NOTE: Vessel Incidental Discharge Act of 2018.>> VESSEL 
INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT
SEC. 901. <<NOTE: 33 USC 1251 note.>>  SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act of 
2018''.
SEC. 902. <<NOTE: 33 USC 1322 note.>>  PURPOSES; FINDINGS.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to provide for the establishment of uniform, 
        environmentally sound standards and requirements for the 
        management of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a 
        vessel;

[[Page 132 STAT. 4323]]

            (2) to charge the Environmental Protection Agency with 
        primary responsibility for establishing standards relating to 
        the discharge of pollutants from vessels;
            (3) to charge the Coast Guard with primary responsibility 
        for prescribing, administering, and enforcing regulations, 
        consistent with the discharge standards established by the 
        Environmental Protection Agency, for the design, construction, 
        installation, and operation of the equipment and management 
        practices required onboard vessels; and
            (4) to preserve the flexibility of States, political 
        subdivisions, and certain regions with respect to the 
        administration and enforcement of standards relating to the 
        discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in maritime 
        commerce and transportation.

    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Environmental Protection Agency is the principal 
        Federal authority charged under the Federal Water Pollution 
        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) with regulating through the 
        issuance of permits for the discharge of pollutants into the 
        navigable waters of the United States;
            (2) the Coast Guard is the principal Federal authority 
        charged with administering, enforcing, and prescribing 
        regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants from 
        vessels; and
            (3) during the period of 1973 to 2010--
                    (A) the Environmental Protection Agency promulgated 
                regulations exempting certain discharges incidental to 
                the normal operation of vessels from otherwise 
                applicable permitting requirements of the Federal Water 
                Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and
                    (B) Congress enacted laws on numerous occasions 
                governing the regulation of discharges incidental to the 
                normal operation of vessels, including--
                          (i) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships 
                      (33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.);
                          (ii) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance 
                      Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 
                      et seq.);
                          (iii) the National Invasive Species Act of 
                      1996 (16 U.S.C. 4701 note; Public Law 104-332);
                          (iv) section 415 of the Coast Guard 
                      Authorization Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-383; 112 
                      Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the Coast Guard and 
                      Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 U.S.C. 
                      1901 note; Public Law 108-293), which established 
                      interim and permanent requirements, respectively, 
                      for the regulation of vessel discharges of certain 
                      bulk cargo residue;
                          (v) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of

                      Law 106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-315), which 
                      prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges in 
                      certain areas of Alaska;
                          (vi) section 204 of the Maritime 
                      Transportation Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 
                      1902a), which established requirements for the 
                      regulation of vessel discharges of agricultural 
                      cargo residue material in the form of hold 
                      washings; and
                          (vii) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization 
                      Act of 2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which 
                      provided for
