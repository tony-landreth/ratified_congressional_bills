among other States shall occur on such dates during the same year as the 
Secretary shall fix, and shall be made on the basis of criteria 
established by regulation. No funds may be reallotted for any use other 
than the use for which the funds were appropriated. Any amount 
reallotted to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year shall 
remain available for obligation during the succeeding fiscal year and 
shall be deemed to be part of the State's allotment for the year in 
which the amount is obligated.
