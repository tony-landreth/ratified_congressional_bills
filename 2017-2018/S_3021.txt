                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 1101. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
                          BILLS.

    It is the sense of Congress that, because the missions of the Corps 
of Engineers for navigation, flood control, beach erosion control and 
shoreline protection, hydroelectric power, recreation, water supply, 
environmental protection, restoration, and enhancement, and fish and 
wildlife mitigation benefit all Americans, and because water resources 
development projects are critical to maintaining the country's economic 
prosperity, national security, and environmental protection, Congress 
should consider a water resources development bill not less often than 
once every Congress.
SEC. 1102. STUDY OF THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF 
                          ENGINEERS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with 
the National Academy of Sciences to convene a committee of experts to 
carry out a comprehensive study on--
            (1) the ability of the Corps of Engineers to carry out its 
        statutory missions and responsibilities, and the potential 
        effects of transferring the functions (including regulatory 
        obligations), personnel, assets, and civilian staff 
        responsibilities of the Secretary relating to civil works from 
        the Department of Defense to a new or existing agency or 
        subagency of the Federal Government, including how such a 
        transfer might affect the Federal Government's ability to meet 
        the current statutory missions and responsibilities of the Corps 
        of Engineers; and
            (2) <<NOTE: Recommenda- tions.>>  improving the Corps of 
        Engineers' project delivery processes, including recommendations 
        for such improvements, taking into account factors including--
                    (A) the effect of the annual appropriations process 
                on the ability of the Corps of Engineers to efficiently 
                secure and carry out contracts for water resources 
                development projects and perform regulatory obligations;
                    (B) the effect that the current Corps of Engineers 
                leadership and geographic structure at the division and 
                district levels has on its ability to carry out its 
                missions in a cost-effective manner; and
                    (C) the effect of the frequency of rotations of 
                senior leaders of the Corps of Engineers and how such 
                frequency affects the function of the district.

    (b) Considerations.--The study carried out under subsection (a) 
shall include consideration of--
            (1) effects on the national security of the United States;

        investment, cost savings, and prioritization, in the 
        formulation, evaluation, and budgeting of such projects.

    (b) <<NOTE: Analyses.>>  Considerations.--The study under subsection 
(a) shall include--
            (1) an analysis of the current economic principles and 
        analytical methodologies used by or applied to the Corps of 
        Engineers in determining the total benefits and total costs 
        during the formulation of, and plan selection for, a water 
        resources development project;
            (2) an analysis of improvements or alternatives to how the 
        Corps of Engineers utilizes the National Economic Development, 
        Regional Economic Development, Environmental Quality, and Other 
        Social Effects accounts developed by the Institute for Water 
        Resources of the Corps of Engineers in the formulation of, and 
        plan selection for, such projects;
            (3) an analysis of whether such principles and methodologies 
        fully account for all of the potential benefits of project 
        alternatives, including any reasonably associated benefits of 
        such alternatives that are not contrary to law, Federal policy, 
        or sound water resources management;
            (4) an analysis of whether such principles and methodologies 
        fully account for all of the costs of project alternatives, 
        including potential societal costs, such as lost ecosystem 
        services, and full lifecycle costs for such alternatives;
            (5) an analysis of the methodologies utilized by the Federal 
        Government in setting and applying discount rates for benefit-
        cost analyses used in the formulation, evaluation, and budgeting 
        of Corps of Engineers water resources development projects;
            (6) an analysis of whether or not the Corps of Engineers--
                    (A) considers cumulative benefits of locally 
                developed projects, including Master Plans approved by 
                the Corps; and
                    (B) uses the benefits referred to in subparagraph 
                (A) for purposes of benefit-cost analysis for project 
                justification for potential projects within such Master 
                Plans; and

SEC. 1104. <<NOTE: 33 USC 2282d note.>>  DISSEMINATION OF 
                          INFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress plays a central role in identifying, 
        prioritizing, and authorizing vital water resources 
        infrastructure activities throughout the United States.
            (2) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 
        (Public Law 113-121) established a new and transparent process 
        to review and prioritize the water resources development 
        activities of the Corps of Engineers with strong congressional 
        oversight.
            (3) Section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d) requires the Secretary 
        to develop and submit to Congress each year a Report to Congress 
        on Future Water Resources Development and, as part of the annual 
        report process, to--
                    (A) publish a notice in the Federal Register that 
                requests from non-Federal interests proposed feasibility 
                studies and proposed modifications to authorized water 
                resources development projects and feasibility studies 
                for inclusion in the report; and
                    (B) review the proposals submitted and include in 
                the report those proposed feasibility studies and 
                proposed modifications that meet the criteria for 
                inclusion established under such section 7001.
            (4) Congress will use the information provided in the annual 
        Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development to 
        determine authorization needs and priorities for purposes of 
        water resources development legislation.
            (5) To ensure that Congress can gain a thorough 
        understanding of the water resources development needs and 
        priorities of the United States, it is important that the 
        Secretary take sufficient steps to ensure that non-Federal 
        interests are made aware of the new annual report process, 
        including the need for non-Federal interests to submit proposals 
        during the Secretary's annual request for proposals in order for 
        such proposals to be eligible for consideration by Congress.

    (b) Dissemination of Process Information.--The Secretary shall
