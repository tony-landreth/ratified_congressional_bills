    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 213 of the Reclamation 
Reform Act of 1982 (43 U.S.C. 390mm), any landowner within the Northport 
Irrigation District in the State of Nebraska (referred to in this 
section as the ``District'') may repay, at any time, the construction 
costs of project facilities allocated to the landowner's land within the 
District.
    (b) Applicability of Full-Cost Pricing Limitations.--On discharge, 
in full, of the obligation for repayment of all construction costs 
described in subsection (a) that are allocated to all land the landowner 
owns in the District in question, the parcels of land shall not be 
subject to the ownership and full-cost pricing limitations under Federal 
reclamation law (the Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, chapter 1093), 
and Acts supplemental to and amendatory of that Act (43 U.S.C. 371 et

            (1) modifies any contractual rights under, or amends or 
        reopens, the reclamation contract between the District and the 
        United States; or
            (2) modifies any rights, obligations, or relationships 
        between the District and landowners in the District under
