        be in the public interest; and

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Emergency event.--The term ``emergency event'' means a 
        situation--
                    (A) that occurs at a location on which a plant or 
                commodity is grown or produced or facility providing for 
                the

[[Page 132 STAT. 4918]]

                storage of, or other services with respect to, a plant 
                or commodity;
                    (B) for which the lack of availability of methyl 
                bromide for a particular use would result in significant 
                economic loss to the owner, lessee, or operator of the 
                location or facility or the owner, grower, or purchaser 
                of the plant or commodity; and
                    (C) that, in light of the specific agricultural, 
                meteorological, or other conditions presented, requires 
                the use of methyl bromide to control a pest or disease 
                in the location or facility because there are no 
                technically feasible alternatives to methyl bromide 
                easily accessible by an entity referred to in 
                subparagraph (B) at the time and location of the event 
                that--
                          (i) are registered under the Federal 
                      Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 
                      U.S.C. 136 et seq.) for the intended use or pest 
                      to be so controlled; and
                          (ii) would adequately control the pest or 
                      disease presented at the location or facility.
            (2) Pest.--The term ``pest'' has the meaning given the term 
        in section 2 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
        Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136).

    (b) Study.--

            (2) Requirements.--The study under paragraph (1) shall 
        include--
                    (A) a risk-benefit analysis of authorizing State, 
                local, or Tribal authorities, in accordance with 
                appropriate requirements and criteria, such as the 
                recommendations developed under subparagraph (E)--
                          (i) to determine when the use of methyl 
                      bromide is required; and
                          (ii) to authorize such use;
                    (B) a risk-benefit analysis of authorizing the 
                Secretary, in accordance with appropriate requirements 
                and criteria, such as the recommendations developed 
                under subparagraph (E)--
                          (i) to determine when the use of methyl 
                      bromide is required; and
                          (ii) to authorize such use;
                    (C) a historic estimate of situations occurring on 
                or after September 15, 1997, that could have been deemed 
                emergency events;
                    (D) a detailed assessment of the adherence of the 
                United States to international obligations of the United 
                States with respect to the prevention of ozone 
                depletion; and
                    (E) an assessment and recommendations on appropriate 
                requirements and criteria to be met to authorize the use 
                of methyl bromide in response to an emergency event 
                (including any recommendations for revising the 
                definition of the term ``emergency event'' in subsection 
                (a)) in a manner that fully complies with the Montreal 
                Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 
                including

[[Page 132 STAT. 4919]]

                Decision IX/7 of the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of 
                the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
                Deplete the Ozone Layer.

SEC. 12511. PRECISION AGRICULTURE CONNECTIVITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Precision agriculture technologies and practices allow 
        farmers to significantly increase crop yields, eliminate overlap 
        in operations, and reduce inputs such as seed, fertilizer, 
        pesticides, water, and fuel.
            (2) These technologies allow farmers to collect data in real 
        time about their fields, automate field management, and maximize 
        resources.
            (3) Studies estimate that precision agriculture technologies 
        can reduce agricultural operation costs by up to 25 dollars per 
        acre and increase farm yields by up to 70 percent by 2050.
            (4) The critical cost savings and productivity benefits of 
        precision agriculture cannot be realized without the 
        availability of reliable broadband Internet access service 
        delivered to the agricultural land of the United States.
            (5) The deployment of broadband Internet access service to 
        unserved agricultural land is critical to the United States

[[Page 132 STAT. 4993]]

        economy and to the continued leadership of the United States in 
        global food production.
            (6) Despite the growing demand for broadband Internet access 
        service on agricultural land, broadband Internet access service 
        is not consistently available where needed for agricultural 
        operations.
            (7) The Federal Communications Commission has an important 
        role to play in the deployment of broadband Internet access 
        service on unserved agricultural land to promote precision 
        agriculture.

    (b) Task Force.--
            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A)(i) The term ``broadband Internet access 
                service'' means a mass-market retail service by wire or 
                radio that provides the capability to transmit data to, 
                and receive data from, all or substantially all Internet 
                endpoints, including any capabilities that are 
                incidental to, and enable the operation of, the 
                communications service, but excluding dial up internet 
                access service.
                    (ii) Such term includes any service the Commission 
                finds to be providing a functional equivalent of the 
                service described in clause (i).
                    (B) The term ``Commission'' means the Federal 
                Communications Commission.
                    (C) The term ``Department'' means the Department of 
                Agriculture.
                    (D) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of 
                Agriculture.
                    (E) The term ``Task Force'' means the Task Force for 
                Reviewing the Connectivity and Technology Needs of 
                Precision Agriculture in the United States established 
                under paragraph (2).
