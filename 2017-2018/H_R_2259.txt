measures, in accordance with local laws, to preserve any information or 
material, in any medium or format, that may be relevant to determining 
the cause or root cause of the death of the volunteer, including 
personal effects, medication, and other tangible items belonging to the

inspect such items before their final disposition.

Inspector General and the detailing department, for a period not to 
exceed 1 year. This paragraph may not be construed to limit or modify 
any other source of authority for reimbursable or nonreimbursable 
details. A nonreimbursable detail made under this section may not be 
considered an augmentation of the appropriations of the Peace Corps.

    ``(6) Upon request, the Peace Corps may make available necessary 
funds to the Inspector General of the Peace Corps for reviews conducted 
by the Inspector General under this section. The request shall be 
limited to costs relating to hiring, procuring, or otherwise obtaining 
medical-related experts or expert services, and associated travel.
