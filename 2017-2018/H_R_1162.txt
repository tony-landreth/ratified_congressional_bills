SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy has 
        successfully treated more than 400 veterans with post-traumatic 
        stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, 
        chronic pain, and opiate addiction.
            (2) Recent clinical trials and randomized, placebo-
        controlled, double-blind studies have produced promising 
        measurable outcomes in the evolution of magnetic EEG/EKG-guided 
        resonance therapy.
            (3) The outcomes described in paragraph (2) have resulted in 
        escalating demand from returning members of the Armed Forces and 
        veterans who are seeking access to magnetic EEG/EKG-guided 
        resonance therapy.
            (4) Congress recognizes the importance of initiating 
        innovative pilot programs that demonstrate the use and 
        effectiveness of new treatment options for post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, 
        chronic pain, and opiate addiction.
