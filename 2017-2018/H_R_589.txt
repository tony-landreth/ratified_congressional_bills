SEC. 103. <<NOTE: 42 USC 18611.>>  SENSE OF CONGRESS ON 
                        ACCELERATING ENERGY INNOVATION.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) although important progress has been made in cost 
        reduction and deployment of clean energy technologies, 
        accelerating clean energy innovation will help meet critical 
        competitiveness, energy security, and environmental goals;
            (2) accelerating the pace of clean energy innovation in the 
        United States calls for--
                    (A) supporting existing research and development 
                programs at the Department and the world-class National 
                Laboratories;
                    (B) exploring and developing new pathways for 
                innovators, investors, and decision-makers to leverage 
                the resources of the Department for addressing the 
                challenges and comparative strengths of geographic 
                regions; and
                    (C) recognizing the financial constraints of the 
                Department, regularly reviewing clean energy programs to 
                ensure that taxpayer investments are maximized;
            (3) the energy supply, demand, policies, markets, and 
        resource options of the United States vary by geographic region;
            (4) a regional approach to innovation can bridge the gaps 
        between local talent, institutions, and industries to identify 
        opportunities and convert United States investment into domestic 
        companies; and
            (5) Congress, the Secretary, and energy industry 
        participants should advance efforts that promote international,

[[Page 132 STAT. 3132]]

        domestic, and regional cooperation on the research and 
        development of energy innovations that--
                    (A) provide clean, affordable, and reliable energy 
                for everyone;
                    (B) promote economic growth;
                    (C) are critical for energy security; and
