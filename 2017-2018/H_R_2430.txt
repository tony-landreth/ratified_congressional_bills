                      that enrollment in such trials more accurately 
                      reflects the patients most likely to receive the 
                      drug, as applicable and as appropriate, while 
                      establishing safe use and supporting findings of

        manufacturer or importer to meet with appropriate personnel of 
        the Food and Drug Administration to discuss the appropriate 
        classification of such accessory prior to submitting a written 
        request under this clause for classification of the accessory.
            ``(iii) <<NOTE: Deadlines.>>  The Secretary shall respond to 
        a request made under clause (ii) not later than 85 calendar days 
        after receiving such request by issuing a written order 
        classifying the accessory or denying the

        agree with the recommendation for classification submitted by 
        the manufacturer or importer, the response shall include a 
        detailed description and justification for such 
        determination. <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication. Notice.>>  
        Within 30 calendar days after granting such a request, the 
        Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register 
        announcing such response.

    ``(E) Nothing in this paragraph may be construed as precluding a 
manufacturer of an accessory of a new type from using the classification 
process described in subsection (f)(2) to obtain classification of such 
accessory in accordance with the criteria and requirements set forth in 
that subsection.''.

SEC. 809. GAO STUDY OF ISSUES REGARDING FIRST CYCLE APPROVALS OF 
                        GENERIC MEDICINES.

    (a) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Study by GAO.--The Comptroller General 
of the United States shall conduct a study to determine the following:
            (1) <<NOTE: Time period.>>  The rate of first cycle 
        approvals and tentative approvals for applications submitted 
        under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
        (21 U.S.C. 355(j)) during the period beginning on October 1, 
        2012, and ending on September 30, 2017. The rate of first cycle 
        approvals and tentative approvals shall be determined and 
        reported per each GDUFA cohort year during this period.
            (2) <<NOTE: Assessment.>>  If the rate determined pursuant 
        to paragraph (1) for any GDUFA cohort year is lower than 20 
        percent, the reasons contributing to the relatively low rate of 
        first cycle approvals and tentative approvals for generic drug 
        applications shall be itemized, assessed, and reported. In 
        making the assessment required by this paragraph, the 
        Comptroller General shall consider, among other things, the role 
        played by--
                    (A) the Food and Drug Administration's 
                implementation of approval standards for generic drug 
                applications;
                    (B) the extent to which those approval standards are 
                communicated clearly to industry and applied 
                consistently during the review process;
                    (C) the procedures for reviewing generic drug 
                applications, including timelines for review activities 
                by the Food and Drug Administration;
                    (D) the extent to which those procedures are 
                followed consistently (and those timelines are met) by 
                the Food and Drug Administration;
                    (E) the processes and practices for communication 
                between the Food and Drug Administration and sponsors of 
                generic drug applications; and
                    (F) the completeness and quality of original generic 
                drug applications submitted to the Food and Drug 
                Administration.
            (3) Taking into account the determinations made pursuant to 
        paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review process improvements 
        implemented pursuant to this Act, whether there are ways the 
        review process for generic drugs could be improved to increase 
        the rate of first cycle approvals and tentative approvals for 
        generic drug applications. In making this determination, the 
        Comptroller General shall consider, among other things, options 
        for increasing review efficiency and communication 
        effectiveness.

[[Page 131 STAT. 1076]]

    (b) <<NOTE: Time period. Reports.>>  Completion Date.--Not later 
than the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on the date of
