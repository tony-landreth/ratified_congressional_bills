                                 An Act


 
   To reauthorize and amend the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction 
 Program, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 11, 2018 -  [S. 1768]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: National 
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. 42 USC 
7701 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Earthquake Hazards Reduction 
Program Reauthorization Act of 2018''.
SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Section 2 of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 
1977 (42 U.S.C. 7701) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by inserting ``, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
                Rico,'' after ``States'';
                    (B) by inserting ``Oregon,'' after ``New York,''; 
                and
                    (C) by inserting ``Tennessee,'' after ``South 
                Carolina'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``prediction techniques 
        and'';
            (3) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:
            ``(4) A well-funded seismological research program could 
        provide the scientific understanding needed to fully implement 
        an effective earthquake early warning system.'';
            (4) in paragraphs (6) and (7), by striking ``lifelines'' 
        each place it appears and inserting ``lifeline infrastructure''; 
        and
            (5) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(12) The built environment has generally been constructed 
        and maintained to meet the needs of the users under normal 
        conditions. When earthquakes occur, the built environment is 
        generally designed to prevent severe injuries or loss of human 
        life and is not expected to remain operational or able to 
        recover under any specified schedule.
            ``(13) The National Research Council published a study on 
        reducing hazards and risks associated with earthquakes based on 
        the goals and objectives for achieving national earthquake 
        resilience described in the strategic plan entitled `Strategic 
        Plan for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program'. The 
        study and an accompanying report called for work in 18 tasks 
        focused on research, preparedness, and mitigation and annual 
        funding of approximately $300,000,000 per year for 20 years.''.

    (b) Purpose.--Section 3 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7702) is amended--

[[Page 132 STAT. 4409]]

            (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), in the first 
        sentence, by inserting ``and increase the resilience of 
        communities'' after ``future earthquakes'';
            (2) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``to individuals and the 
        communities'' after ``an earthquake'';
            (3) in paragraph (2), by striking ``in time of disaster'' 
        and inserting ``to facilitate community-wide post-earthquake 
        recovery and in times of disaster'';
            (4) in paragraph (3), by striking ``for predicting damaging 
        earthquakes and'';
            (5) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``and planning'' after 
        ``model building''; and
            (6) in paragraph (5), by striking ``reconstruction'' and 
        inserting ``re-occupancy, recovery, reconstruction,''.

    (c) Definitions.--
            (1) Lifeline infrastructure.--
                    (A) In general.--Section 4(6) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
                7703(6)) is amended by striking ``lifelines'' and 
                inserting ``lifeline infrastructure''.
                    (B) Conforming amendment.--Such Act (42 U.S.C. 7701 
                et seq.) is amended by striking ``lifelines'' each place 
                it appears and inserting ``lifeline infrastructure''.
            (2) Community resilience.--Section 4 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
        7703) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(10) The term `community resilience' means the ability of 
        a community to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and 
        more successfully adapt to adverse seismic events.''.

            (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``develop, operate'' 
        and all that follows through ``7708),'' and inserting ``continue 
        the development of the Advanced National Seismic System,
