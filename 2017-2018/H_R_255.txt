To authorize the National Science Foundation to support entrepreneurial

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Promoting Women

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship 
Act''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 42 USC 1885a note.>>  FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) women make up almost 50 percent of the workforce, but 
        less than 25 percent of the workforce in science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions;
            (2) women are less likely to focus on the STEM disciplines 
        in undergraduate and graduate study;
            (3) only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM 
        fields work in STEM jobs;
            (4) there is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM 
        degrees to extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can 
        be leaders in discovery commercialization;
            (5) studies have shown that technology and commercialization 
        ventures are successful when women are in top management 
        positions; and
            (6) the National Science Foundation's mission includes 
        supporting women in STEM disciplines.
SEC. 3. SUPPORTING WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURIAL PROGRAMS.

    Section 33 of the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1885a) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (10);
            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (11) and 
        inserting ``; and''; and
