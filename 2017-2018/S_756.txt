        Federal Prison Industries for competition with private sector 
        providers of products and services.
            (3) An evaluation of whether the following factors create an 
        unfair competitive environment between Federal Prison Industries 
        and private sector providers of products and services which 
        would be exacerbated by further expansion:
                    (A) Federal Prison Industries's status as a 
                mandatory source of supply for Federal agencies and the 
                requirement that the buying agency must obtain a waiver 
                in order to make a competitive purchase from the private 
                sector if the item to be acquired is listed on the 
                schedule of products and services published by Federal 
                Prison Industries.
                    (B) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Federal Prison 
                Industries's ability to determine that the price to be 
                paid by Federal Agencies is fair and reasonable, rather 
                than such a determination being made by the buying 
                agency.
                    (C) <<NOTE: Examination.>>  An examination of the 
                extent to which Federal Prison Industries is bound by

                the delivered product with the specified design and 
                performance specifications and adherence to the delivery 
                schedule required by the Federal agency, based on the 
                transactions being categorized as interagency transfers.
                    (D) <<NOTE: Examination.>>  An examination of the 
                extent to which Federal Prison Industries avoids 
                transactions that are little more than pass through 
                transactions where the work provided by inmates does not 
                create meaningful value or meaningful work opportunities 
                for inmates.
                    (E) <<NOTE: Compliance.>>  The extent to which

                regulations applicable to, and enforceable against, 
                Federal contractors.
                    (F) The wages Federal Prison Industries pays to 
                inmates, taking into account inmate productivity and 
                other factors such as security concerns associated with 
                having a facility in a prison.
                    (G) The effect of any additional cost advantages 
                Federal Prison Industries has over private sector 
                providers of goods and services, including--
                          (i) the costs absorbed by the Bureau of 
                      Prisons such as inmate medical care and
