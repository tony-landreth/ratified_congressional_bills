                      full-body exposure to a covered substance 
                      frequently may be unavailable because such tests 
                      were classified or such records were lost or 
                      destroyed;
                          (ii) that many veterans were sworn to secrecy 
                      following testing described in clause (i);
                          (iii) each statement based on personal 
                      knowledge of a veteran who served at a site listed 
                      in paragraph (3);

                      Secretary of Defense under subsection (b)(2); and
                          (v) any evidence the Secretary considers 
                      relevant; and
                    (B) may not determine that testing of full-body 
                exposure to a covered substance did not occur at a site 
                based solely on--
                          (i) information contained in the Department of 
                      Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs 
                      Chemical Biological Warfare Database; or
                          (ii) any list of known sites of testing of 
                      full-body exposure to a covered substance 
                      maintained by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
                      or the Department of Defense.
            (5) <<NOTE: Determination.>>  Presumption of exposure.--In 
        carrying out paragraph (1), when the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs makes a determination regarding whether a veteran 
        experienced full-body exposure to a covered substance, the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) shall presume, unless there is affirmative 
                evidence to establish otherwise, that the veteran 
                experienced such exposure by reason of the service of 
                the veteran in World War II--
                          (i) based on the locations listed in paragraph 
                      (3); and
                          (ii) consistent with the places, types, and 
                      circumstances of service of the veteran in 
                      accordance with section 1154 of title 38; and
                    (B) shall resolve each reasonable doubt in favor of 
                the veteran.
            (6) Effective date of award.--The effective date of any 
        award of disability compensation resulting from reconsideration 
        of a claim under paragraph (1) shall be fixed in accordance

[[Page 131 STAT. 998]]

        with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of 
        the receipt of the claim for compensation described in paragraph 
        (2).

    (b) Investigation and Report by the Secretary of Defense.--Not later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of Defense shall--
            (1) investigate and assess each site--
                    (A) where the Army Corps of Engineers has uncovered 
                evidence of testing conducted by the Department of 
                Defense during World War II to assess the effects of 
                full-body exposure to a covered substance on humans; or
                    (B) with regards to which more than two veterans 
                have been denied claims for compensation under chapter 
                11 of title 38, United States Code, in connection with 
                exposure to a covered substance at such site; and
            (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees and 
        the Secretary of Veterans Affairs a report on testing described 
        in paragraph (1)(A), including--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Lists.>>  a list of each location where 
                such testing occurred, including locations investigated 
                and assessed under paragraph (1);
                    (B) the dates of each such testing; and

                experienced full-body exposure to a covered substance in

                individuals who experienced full-body exposure to a 
                covered substance in the course of testing described in 
                subsection (b)(1)(A);
                    (B) the number of claims filed with the Secretary 
                for disability compensation under chapter 11 of title
