carrier program:
            (1) The use of such a contract will result in significant 
        savings compared to the total anticipated costs of carrying out 
        the program through annual contracts. In certifying cost savings 
        under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall include a 
        written explanation of--
                    (A) the estimated obligations and expenditures by

        request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid 
        contract cancellation.
            (3) There is a stable design for the property to be acquired 
        and that the technical risks associated with such property are 
        not excessive.
            (4) The estimates of both the cost of the contract and the 
        anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a contract 
        authorized under subsection (a) are realistic.

SEC. 317. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION 
                        PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has identified nearly 39,500 
        sites that fall under the installation restoration program sites 
        and munitions response sites.
            (2) The installation response program addresses 
        contamination from hazardous substances, pollutants, or 
        contaminants and active military installations, formerly used 
        defense site properties, and base realignment and closure 
        locations in the United States.

[[Page 132 STAT. 1715]]

            (3) Munitions response sites are known or suspected to 
        contain unexploded ordnance, discarded military munitions, or 
        munitions constitutes are addressed through the military 
        munitions response program.
            (4) The installation restoration program sites and munitions 
        response sites have had significant impacts on state and local 
        governments that have had to bear the increased costs of 
        environmental degradation, notably groundwater contamination, 
        and local populations that have had to live with the 
        consequences of contaminated drinking, including increased 
        health concerns and decreasing property values.
            (5) Through the end of fiscal year 2017, the Department of 
        Defense had achieved response complete at 86 percent of 
        installation restoration program sites and munitions response 
        sites, but projects that it will fall short of meeting its goal 
        of 90 percent by the end of fiscal year 2018.
            (6) The fiscal year 2019 budget request for environmental 
        restoration and base realignment and closure amounted to nearly 
        $1,318,320,000, a decrease of $53,429,000 from the amount 
        authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2018 (Public Law 115-91).

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the environmental restoration and base realignment and 
        closure programs are important for the protection of the 
        environment, the health of the military and civilian personnel 
        and their families who live and work on military installations, 
        to ensure that current and legacy military operations do not 
        adversely affect the health or environments of surrounding 
        communities;
            (2) the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces should 
        seek to reduce the financial burden on state and local 
        government who are bearing significant costs of cleanup stemming 
        from defense related activities;
            (3) the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces should 
        expedite and streamline cleanup at locations where contamination 
        is having a direct impact on civilian access to clean drinking 
        water;
            (4) the Department of Defense and the Armed Forces should 
        continue to engage with and help allay local community concerns 
        about the safety of the drinking water due to environmental

SEC. 334. SURFACE WARFARE TRAINING IMPROVEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2017, there were three collisions and one grounding 
        involving United States Navy ships in the Western Pacific. The 
        two most recent mishaps involved separate incidents of a Japan-
        based United States Navy destroyer colliding with a commercial 
        merchant vessel, resulting in the combined loss of 17 sailors.
            (2) The causal factors in these four mishaps are linked 
        directly to a failure to take sufficient action in accordance 
        with the rules of good seamanship.
            (3) Because risks are high in the maritime environment, 
        there are widely accepted standards for safe seamanship and 
        navigation. In the United States, the International Convention 
        on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 
        (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ``STCW'') for 
        Seafarers, standardizes the skills and foundational knowledge a 
        maritime professional must have in seamanship and navigation.
            (4) Section 568 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2139) 
        endorsed the STCW process and required the Secretary of Defense 
        to maximize the extent to which Armed Forces service, training, 
        and qualifications are creditable toward meeting merchant 
        mariner licenses and certifications.
            (5) The Surface Warfare Officer Course Curriculum is being 
        modified to include ten individual Go/No Go Mariner Assessments/
        Competency Check Milestones to ensure standardization and 
        quality of the surface warfare community.
            (6) The Military-to-Mariner Transition report of September 
        2017 notes the Army maintains an extensive STCW qualifications 
        program and that a similar Navy program does not exist.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of the Navy should establish a 
        comprehensive individual proficiency assessment process and 
        include such

[[Page 132 STAT. 1727]]

        an assessment prior to all operational surface warfare officer 
        tour assignments; and
            (2) the Secretary of the Navy should significantly expand 
        the STCW qualifications process to improve seamanship and 
        navigation individual skills training for surface warfare 
        candidates, surface warfare officers, quartermasters and 
        operations specialists to include an increased set of courses 
        that directly correspond to STCW standards.

    (c) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2019, the Secretary of the Navy 
shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report that 
includes each of the following:
            (1) A detailed description of the surface warfare officer 
        assessments process.
            (2) A list of programs that have been approved for credit 
        toward merchant mariner credentials.
            (3) A complete gap analysis of the existing surface warfare 
        training curriculum and STCW.
            (4) A complete gap analysis of the existing surface warfare 
        training curriculum and the 3rd mate unlimited licensing 
        requirement.
            (5) An assessment of surface warfare options to complete the 
        3rd mate unlimited license and the STCW qualification.

        critical importance to the national security of the United 
        States;
            (2) the Soo Locks are the only waterway connection from Lake 
        Superior to the Lower Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway;
            (3) only the Poe Lock is of sufficient size to allow for the 
        passage of the largest cargo vessels that transport well over 90 
        percent of all iron ore mined in the United States, and this 
        lock is nearing the end of its 50-year useful lifespan;
            (4) a report issued by the Office of Cyber and 
        Infrastructure Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security 
        concluded that an unscheduled 6-month outage of the Poe Lock 
        would cause--

                unemployment; and

                production to cease;

[[Page 132 STAT. 1734]]

            (5) the Corps of Engineers is reevaluating a past economic 
        evaluation report to update the benefit-to-cost ratio for 
        building a new lock at the Soo Locks; and
            (6) the Secretary of the Army and all relevant Federal 
        agencies should--
                    (A) expedite the completion of the report described 
                in paragraph (5) and ensure the analysis adequately 
                reflects the critical importance of the Soo Locks 
                infrastructure to the national security and economy of 
                the United States; and

shall develop policies for the Department of Defense to ensure the best 
information regarding past performance of certain subcontractors and 
joint venture partners is available when awarding Department of Defense 
contracts. The policies shall include proposed revisions to the Defense 
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement as follows:
            (1) Required performance evaluations, as part of a 
        government-wide evaluation reporting tool, for first-tier 
        subcontractors on construction and architect-engineer contracts 
        performing a portion of the contract valued at the threshold set 
        forth in section 42.1502(e) of the Federal Acquisition 
        Regulation, or 20 percent of the value of the prime contract, 
        whichever is higher, provided--
                    (A) the information included in rating the 
                subcontractor is not inconsistent with the information 
                included in the rating for the prime contractor;
                    (B) the subcontractor evaluation is conducted 
                consistent with the provisions of section 42.15 of the 
                Federal Acquisition Regulation;
                    (C) negative evaluations of a subcontractor in no 
                way obviate the prime contractor's responsibility for 
                successful completion of the contract and management of 
                its subcontractors; and
                    (D) that in the judgment of the contracting officer, 
                the overall execution of the work is impacted by the 
                performance of the subcontractor or subcontractors.
            (2) Required performance evaluations, as part of a 
        government-wide evaluation reporting tool, of individual 
        partners of joint venture-awarded construction and architect-
        engineer contracts valued at the threshold set forth in section 
        42.1502(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, to ensure that 
        past performance on joint venture projects is considered in 
        future awards to individual joint venture partners, provided--
                    (A) at a minimum, the rating for joint ventures 
                includes an identification that allows the evaluation to 
                be retrieved for each partner of the joint venture;
                    (B) each partner, through the joint venture, is 
                given the same opportunity to submit comments, rebutting 
                statements, or additional information, consistent with 
                the provisions of section 42.15 of the Federal 
                Acquisition Regulation; and

[[Page 132 STAT. 1856]]

                    (C) the rating clearly identifies the 
                responsibilities of joint venture partners for discrete 
                elements of the work where the partners are not jointly 
                and severally responsible for the project.
            (3) Processes to request exceptions from the annual 
        evaluation requirement under section 42.1502(a) of the Federal 
        Acquisition Regulation for construction and architect-engineer 
        contracts where submission of the annual evaluations would not 
        provide the best representation of the performance of a 
        contractor, including subcontractors and joint venture partners, 
        including--
                    (A) where no severable element of the work has been 
                completed;
                    (B) where the contracting officer determines that--
                          (i) an insubstantial portion of the contract 
                      work has been completed in the preceding year; and
                          (ii) the lack of performance is at no fault to 
                      the contractor; or
                    (C) where the contracting officer determines that 
                there is an issue in dispute which, until resolved, 
                would likely cause the annual rating to inaccurately 
                reflect the past performance of the contractor.
SEC. 824. SUBCONTRACTING PRICE AND APPROVED PURCHASING SYSTEMS.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 893 of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 10 U.S.C. 
2302 note) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (g), by adding at the end the following 
        new paragraph:

        given the term in section 44.101 of the Federal Acquisition 
        Regulation (or any similar regulation).''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:

    ``(i) Consent to Subcontract.--If the contractor on a Department of 
Defense contract requiring a contracting officer's written consent prior 
to the contractor entering into a subcontract has an approved purchasing 
system, the contracting officer may not withhold such consent without 
the written approval of the program manager.''.

than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
of Defense shall revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation 
Supplement to conform with the amendments to section 893 of the Ike

SEC. 880 <<NOTE: 41 USC 3701 note.>> . USE OF LOWEST PRICE 
                        TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE SOURCE SELECTION 
                        PROCESS.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States Government to avoid using lowest price technically acceptable 
source selection criteria in circumstances that would deny the 
Government the benefits of cost and technical tradeoffs in the source 
selection process.
    (b) Revision of Federal Acquisition Regulation.--Not later than 120 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to require that, for 
solicitations issued on or after the date that is 120 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, lowest price technically acceptable 
source selection criteria are used only in situations in which--
            (1) an executive agency is able to comprehensively and 
        clearly describe the minimum requirements expressed in terms of 
        performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be 
        used to determine acceptability of offers;
            (2) the executive agency would realize no, or minimal, value 
        from a contract proposal exceeding the minimum technical or 
        performance requirements set forth in the request for proposal;
            (3) the proposed technical approaches will require no, or 
        minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority 
        as to the desirability of one offeror's proposal versus a 
        competing proposal;
            (4) the executive agency has a high degree of confidence 
        that a review of technical proposals of offerors other than the 
        lowest bidder would not result in the identification of factors 
        that could provide value or benefit to the executive agency;

[[Page 132 STAT. 1910]]

            (5) the contracting officer has included a justification for 
        the use of a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation 
        methodology in the contract file; and
            (6) the executive agency has determined that the lowest 
        price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations 
        and support.

    (c) Avoidance of Use of Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source 
Selection Criteria in Certain Procurements.--To the maximum extent 
practicable, the use of lowest price technically acceptable source 
selection criteria shall be avoided in the case of a procurement that is 
predominately for the acquisition of--
            (1) information technology services, cybersecurity services, 
        systems engineering and technical assistance services, advanced 
        electronic testing, audit or audit readiness services, health 
        care services and records, telecommunications devices and 
        services, or other knowledge-based professional services;
            (2) personal protective equipment; or
            (3) knowledge-based training or logistics services in 
        contingency operations or other operations outside the United 
        States, including in Afghanistan or Iraq.

    (d) Report Requirement.--Not later than one year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for two years, the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report on the number of instances in which 
lowest price technically acceptable source selection criteria is used 
for a contract exceeding $5,000,000, including an explanation of how the 
situations listed in subsection (b) were considered in making a 
determination to use lowest price technically acceptable source 
selection criteria.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Executive agency.--The term ``executive agency'' has the 
        meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40, United

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) gaining and maintaining situational awareness and

        States is critical to national security;
            (2) the United States Government must devote adequate 
        resources to securing the border, both at, and between, ports of 
        entry, and the agency tasked with that mission, the Department 
        of Homeland Security, should be adequately resourced to conduct 
        such mission; and
            (3) the Department of Defense must ensure that when it acts 
        in support of that mission, such as when mobilized by the 
        President to conduct homeland defense activities, or when 
        military facilities are adjacent to an international border of 
        the United States, it has adequate resources, capabilities, and

                          JUVENILE-ON-JUVENILE PROBLEMATIC SEXUAL 
                          BEHAVIOR COMMITTED ON MILITARY 
                          INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Policy Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a 
policy, applicable across the military installations of the Department 
of Defense (including installations outside the United States), on the 
response of the Department to allegations of juvenile-on-juvenile 
problematic sexual behavior on military installations. The policy shall 
be designed to ensure a consistent, standardized response to such 
allegations across the Department.
    (b) Elements.--The policy required by this section shall provide for 
the following:
            (1) Any report or other allegation of juvenile-on-juvenile 
        problematic sexual behavior on a military installation that is 
        received by the installation commander, a law enforcement 
        organization, a Family Advocacy Program, a child development 
        center, a military treatment facility, or a Department school 
        operating on the installation or otherwise under Department 
        administration for the installation shall be reviewed by the 
        Family Advocacy Program of the installation.
            (2) Personnel of Family Advocacy Programs conducting reviews 
        shall have appropriate training and experience in working with 
        juveniles.
            (3) Family Advocacy Programs conducting reviews shall 
        conduct a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary review and recommend 
        treatment, counseling, or other appropriate interventions for 
        complainants and respondents.
            (4) Each review shall be conducted--
                    (A) with full involvement of appropriate authorities 
                and entities, including parents or legal guardians of 
                the juveniles involved (if practicable); and

[[Page 132 STAT. 1997]]

                    (B) to the extent practicable, in a manner that 
                protects the sensitive nature of the incident concerned, 
                using language appropriate to the treatment of juveniles 
                in written policies and communication with families.
            (5) The requirement for investigation of a report or other 
        allegation shall not be deemed to terminate or alter any 
        otherwise applicable requirement to report or forward the report 
        or allegation to appropriate Federal, State, or local 
        authorities as possible criminal activity.
            (6) There shall be established and maintained a centralized 
        database of information on each incident of problematic sexual 
        behavior that is reviewed by a Family Advocacy Program under the 
        policy established under this section, with--
                    (A) the information in such database kept strictly 
                confidential; and
                    (B) because the information involves alleged conduct 
                by juveniles, additional special precautions taken to 
                ensure the information is available only to persons who 
                require access to the information.
            (7) There shall be entered into the database, for each 
        substantiated or unsubstantiated incident of problematic sexual 
        behavior, appropriate information on the incident, including--
                    (A) a description of the allegation;
                    (B) whether or not the review is completed;
                    (C) whether or not the incident was subject to an 
                investigation by a law enforcement organization or 
                entity, and the status and results of such 
                investigation; and
                    (D) whether or not action was taken in response to 
                the incident, and the nature of the action, if any, so 
                taken.

        standards.

                necessary to support the addition; and

cyber capabilities to impose costs on any foreign power targeting the 
United States or United States persons with a cyber attack or malicious 
cyber activity described in subsection (a).

SEC. 1673. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR POSTURE OF THE UNITED 
                          STATES.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) for more than 70 years the nuclear deterrent of the 
        United States has played, and will continue to play, a central 
        role in the national security of the United States and 
        international stability;
            (2) strong, credible, and flexible nuclear forces of the 
        United States deter aggression by adversaries and assure the 
        allies of the United States that the extended deterrence 
        commitments of the United States are steadfast;
            (3) the 2017 National Security Strategy, the 2018 National 
        Defense Strategy, and the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review correctly 
        assess changes in the security environment related to interstate 
        strategic competition and recognize that the defense policies 
        and posture of the United States, including those related to 
        nuclear forces, must undergo measured adjustments;
            (4) the United States remains committed to, and will 
        continue to honor, its full range of nuclear arms control and 
        nonproliferation treaty obligations and seeks continued 
        engagement for prudent and verifiable agreements, however, the 
        policies and actions of the United States must also hold states 
        that violate such treaties accountable for such violations and 
        take such violations into account when considering further arms 
        control agreements;
            (5) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) plays an 
        essential role in the national security of the United States and 
        NATO should continue to strengthen and align its nuclear and 
        conventional deterrence posture, planning, and exercises to 
        align with modern threats, including modernizing its dual-
        capable aircraft, command and control networks, nuclear-related 
        facilities, and conventional capabilities;
            (6) the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review rightly states that the 
        United States requires reliable, diverse, and tailorable nuclear 
        forces capable of responding to a variety of current threats 
        while preparing for future uncertainty and directs

[[Page 132 STAT. 2159]]

        implementation of a comprehensive nuclear modernization program 
        at both the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear 
        Security Administration; and
            (7) the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear 
        Security Administration must integrate, partner, and organize 
        themselves to successfully execute all aspects of the nuclear 
        modernization program, including those regarding nuclear forces, 
        warheads, infrastructure, command and control, and personnel.

        ammonium perchlorate, for use in solid rocket motors. Such 
        analysis shall include assessments of the near- and long-term 
        costs, operating and sustainment costs, program impacts, 
        opportunities for competition, opportunities for redundant or 
        complementary capabilities, and national security implications 
        of using such a model.
            (2) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2019, the Secretary and 
        the Under Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense 
        committees the business case analysis conducted under paragraph

                          INVESTMENT RISK REVIEW MODERNIZATION ACT 
                          OF 2018.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Foreign Investment Risk Review 
Modernization Act of 2018''.
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) <<NOTE: 50 USC 4565 note.>>  Findings.--Congress makes the 
following findings:
            (1) According to a February 2016 report by the International 
        Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, 12,000,000 
        United States workers, equivalent to 8.5 percent of the labor 
        force, have jobs resulting from foreign investment, including 
        3,500,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector alone.
            (2) In 2016, new foreign direct investment in United States 
        manufacturing totaled $129,400,000,000.
            (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of 
        Commerce concluded that, in 2015--
                    (A) foreign-owned affiliates in the United States--
                          (i) contributed $894,500,000,000 in value 
                      added to the United States economy;
                          (ii) exported goods valued at 
                      $352,800,000,000, accounting for nearly a quarter 
                      of total exports of goods from the United States; 
                      and
                          (iii) undertook $56,700,000,000 in research 
                      and development; and

[[Page 132 STAT. 2175]]

                    (B) the 7 countries investing the most in the United 
                States, all of which are United States allies (the 
                United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, Canada, 
                Switzerland, and the Netherlands) accounted for 72.1 
                percent of the value added by foreign-owned affiliates 
                in the United States and more than 80 percent of 
                research and development expenditures by such entities.
            (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, from 
        2011 to 2016, the number of transactions reviewed by the 
        Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (commonly 
        referred to as ``CFIUS'') grew by 55 percent, while the staff of 
        the Committees assigned to the reviews increased by 11 percent.
            (5) According to a February 2018 report of the Government 
        Accountability Office on the Committee on Foreign Investment in 
        the United States (GAO-18-249): ``Officials from Treasury and 
        other member agencies are aware of pressures on their CFIUS 
        staff given the current workload and have expressed concerns 
        about possible workload increases.''. The Government 
        Accountability Office concluded: ``Without attaining an 
        understanding of the staffing levels needed to address the 
        current and future CFIUS workload, particularly if legislative 
        changes to CFIUS's authorities further expand its workload, 
        CFIUS may be limited in its ability to fulfill its objectives 
        and address threats to the national security of the United 
        States.''.
            (6) On March 30, 1954, Dwight David Eisenhower--five-star 
        general, Supreme Allied Commander, and 34th President of the 
        United States--in his ``Special Message to the Congress on 
        Foreign Economic Policy'', counseled: ``Great mutual advantages 
        to buyer and seller, to producer and consumer, to investor and 
        to the community where investment is made, accrue from high 
        levels of trade and investment.''. President Eisenhower 
        continued: ``The internal strength of the American economy has 
        evolved from such a system of mutual advantage. In the press of 
        other problems and in the haste to meet emergencies, this 
        nation--and many other nations of the free world--have all too 
        often lost sight of this central fact.''. President Eisenhower 
        concluded: ``If we fail in our trade policy, we may fail in all. 
        Our domestic employment, our standard of living, our security, 
        and the solidarity of the free world--all are involved.''.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) foreign investment provides substantial economic 
        benefits to the United States, including the promotion of 
        economic growth, productivity, competitiveness, and job 
        creation, thereby enhancing national security;
            (2) maintaining the commitment of the United States to an 
        open investment policy encourages other countries to reciprocate 
        and helps open new foreign markets for United States businesses;
            (3) it should continue to be the policy of the United States 
        to enthusiastically welcome and support foreign investment, 
        consistent with the protection of national security;
            (4) at the same time, the national security landscape has 
        shifted in recent years, and so has the nature of the 
        investments that pose the greatest potential risk to national 
        security, which warrants an appropriate modernization of the 
        processes and

[[Page 132 STAT. 2176]]

        authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United 
        States and of the United States export control system;
            (5) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
        plays a critical role in protecting the national security of the 
        United States, and, therefore, it is essential that the member 
        agencies of the Committee are adequately resourced and able to 
        hire appropriately qualified individuals in a timely manner, and 
        that those individuals' security clearances are processed as a 
        high priority;
            (6) the President should conduct a more robust international 
        outreach effort to urge and help allies and partners of the 
        United States to establish processes that are similar to the 
        Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to screen 
        foreign investments for national security risks and to 
        facilitate coordination;
            (7) the President should lead a collaborative effort with 
        allies and partners of the United States to strengthen the 
        multilateral export control regime;
            (8) any penalties imposed by the United States Government 
        with respect to an individual or entity pursuant to a 
        determination that the individual or entity has violated 
        sanctions imposed by the United States or the export control 
        laws of the United States should not be reversed for reasons 
        unrelated to the national security of the United States; and
            (9) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States 
        should continue to review transactions for the purpose of 
        protecting national security and should not consider issues of 
        national interest absent a national security nexus.

    (c) Sense of Congress on Consideration of Covered Transactions.--It 
is the sense of Congress that, when considering national security risks, 
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States may consider--
            (1) whether a covered transaction involves a country of 
        special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic 
        goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical 
        infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in 
        areas related to national security;
            (2) the potential national security-related effects of the 
        cumulative control of, or pattern of recent transactions 
        involving, any one type of critical infrastructure, energy 
        asset, critical material, or critical technology by a foreign 
        government or foreign person;
            (3) whether any foreign person engaging in a covered 
        transaction with a United States business has a history of 
        complying with United States laws and regulations;
            (4) the control of United States industries and commercial 
        activity by foreign persons as it affects the capability and 
        capacity of the United States to meet the requirements of 
        national security, including the availability of human 
        resources, products, technology, materials, and other supplies 
        and services, and in considering ``the availability of human 
        resources'', should construe that term to include potential 
        losses of such availability resulting from reductions in the 
        employment of United States persons whose knowledge or skills 
        are critical to national security, including the continued 
        production in the United States of items that are likely to be 
        acquired by the

[[Page 132 STAT. 2177]]

        Department of Defense or other Federal departments or agencies 
        for the advancement of the national security of the United 
        States;
            (5) the extent to which a covered transaction is likely to 
        expose, either directly or indirectly, personally identifiable 
        information, genetic information, or other sensitive data of 
        United States citizens to access by a foreign government or 
        foreign person that may exploit that information in a manner 
        that threatens national security; and
            (6) whether a covered transaction is likely to have the 
        effect of exacerbating or creating new cybersecurity 
        vulnerabilities in the United States or is likely to result in a 
        foreign government gaining a significant new capability to 
        engage in malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United 
        States, including such activities designed to affect the outcome 
        of any election for Federal office.

     PART I-- <<NOTE: Export Controls Act of 2018.>> AUTHORITY AND 
ADMINISTRATION OF CONTROLS
SEC. 1751. <<NOTE: 50 USC 4801 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This part may be cited as the ``Export Controls Act of 2018''.

[[Page 132 STAT. 2210]]

SEC. <<NOTE: 50 USC 4811.>> 1752. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    The following is the policy of the United States:
            (1) To use export controls only after full consideration of 
        the impact on the economy of the United States and only to the 
        extent necessary--
                    (A) to restrict the export of items which would make 
                a significant contribution to the military potential of 
                any other country or combination of countries which 
                would prove detrimental to the national security of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) to restrict the export of items if necessary to 
                further significantly the foreign policy of the United 
                States or to fulfill its declared international 
                obligations.
            (2) The national security and foreign policy of the United 
        States require that the export, reexport, and in-country 
        transfer of items, and specific activities of United States 
        persons, wherever located, be controlled for the following 
        purposes:
                    (A) To control the release of items for use in--
                          (i) the proliferation of weapons of mass 
                      destruction or of conventional weapons;
                          (ii) the acquisition of destabilizing numbers 
                      or types of conventional weapons;
                          (iii) acts of terrorism;
                          (iv) military programs that could pose a 
                      threat to the security of the United States or its 
                      allies; or
                          (v) activities undertaken specifically to 
                      cause significant interference with or disruption 
                      of critical infrastructure.
                    (B) To preserve the qualitative military superiority 
                of the United States.
                    (C) To strengthen the United States defense 
                industrial base.
                    (D) To carry out the foreign policy of the United 
                States, including the protection of human rights and the 
                promotion of democracy.
                    (E) To carry out obligations and commitments under 
                international agreements and arrangements, including 
                multilateral export control regimes.
                    (F) To facilitate military interoperability between 
                the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty 
                Organization (NATO) and other close allies.
                    (G) To ensure national security controls are 
                tailored to focus on those core technologies and other 
                items that are capable of being used to pose a serious 
                national security threat to the United States.
            (3) The national security of the United States requires that 
        the United States maintain its leadership in the science, 
        technology, engineering, and manufacturing sectors, including 
        foundational technology that is essential to innovation. Such 
        leadership requires that United States persons are competitive 
        in global markets. The impact of the implementation of this part 
        on such leadership and competitiveness must be evaluated on an 
        ongoing basis and applied in imposing controls under sections 
        1753 and 1754 to avoid negatively affecting such leadership.
            (4) The national security and foreign policy of the United 
        States require that the United States participate in 
        multilateral

[[Page 132 STAT. 2211]]

        organizations and agreements regarding export controls on items 
        that are consistent with the policy of the United States, and 
        take all the necessary steps to secure the adoption and 
        consistent enforcement, by the governments of such countries, of 
        export controls on items that are consistent with such policy.
            (5) Export controls should be coordinated with the 
        multilateral export control regimes. Export controls that are 
        multilateral are most effective, and should be tailored to focus 
        on those core technologies and other items that are capable of 
        being used to pose a serious national security threat to the 
        United States and its allies.
            (6) Export controls applied unilaterally to items widely 
        available from foreign sources generally are less effective in 
        preventing end-users from acquiring those items. Application of 
        unilateral export controls should be limited for purposes of 
        protecting specific United States national security and foreign 
        policy interests.
            (7) The effective administration of export controls requires 
        a clear understanding both inside and outside the United States 
        Government of which items are controlled and an efficient 
        process should be created to regularly update the controls, such 
        as by adding or removing such items.
            (8) The export control system must ensure that it is 
        transparent, predictable, and timely, has the flexibility to be 
        adapted to address new threats in the future, and allows 
        seamless access to and sharing of export control information 
        among all relevant United States national security and foreign 
        policy agencies.
            (9) Implementation and enforcement of United States export 
        controls require robust capabilities in monitoring, 
        intelligence, and investigation, appropriate penalties for 
        violations, and the ability to swiftly interdict unapproved 
        transfers.
            (10) Export controls complement and are a critical element 
        of the national security policies underlying the laws and 
        regulations governing foreign direct investment in the United 
        States, including controlling the transfer of critical 
        technologies to certain foreign persons. Thus, the President, in 
        coordination with the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, the 
        Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of 
        other Federal agencies, as appropriate, should have a regular 
        and robust process to identify the emerging and other types of 
        critical technologies of concern and regulate their release to 
        foreign persons as warranted regardless of the nature of the 
        underlying transaction. Such identification efforts should draw 
        upon the resources and expertise of all relevant parts of the 
        United States Government, industry, and academia. These efforts 
        should be in addition to traditional efforts to modernize and 
        update the lists of controlled items under the multilateral 
        export control regimes.
            (11) The authority under this part may be exercised only in 
        furtherance of all of the objectives set forth in paragraphs (1) 
        through (10).

                    (B) Determination under other provisions of law.--A

    (d) Enhanced Controls.--
            (1) In general.--In furtherance of section 1753(a), the

                security and foreign policy that the authority of this 
                part may be used to address; and
                    (B) exercising the authority under this part to 
                implement policies, regulations, procedures, and actions

                this part;
                    (D) standards for compliance by persons subject to

        (a).

[[Page 132 STAT. 2217]]

    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
administration of export controls under this part should be consistent 
with the procedures relating to export license applications described in

SEC. 1756. <<NOTE: 50 USC 4815.>> LICENSING.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall, consistent with delegations as 
described in section 1755, establish a procedure to license or otherwise 
authorize the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of items 
controlled under this part in order to carry out the policy set forth in 
section 1752 and the requirements set forth in section 1753(b). The 
procedure shall ensure that--
            (1) license applications and other requests for 
        authorization are considered and decisions made with the 
        participation of appropriate Federal agencies, as appropriate; 
        and
            (2) licensing decisions are made in an expeditious manner, 
        with transparency to applicants on the status of license and 
        other authorization processing and the reason for denying any 
        license or request for authorization.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary should make best efforts to ensure that an accurate, 
consistent, and timely evaluation and processing of licenses or other 
requests for authorization to export, reexport, or in-country transfer 
items controlled under this part is generally accomplished within 30 
days from the date of such license request.
    (c) Fees.--No fee may be charged in connection with the submission, 
processing, or consideration of any application for a license or other 
authorization or other request made in connection with any regulation in 
effect under the authority of this part.
    (d) Additional Procedural Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--The procedure required under subsection (a) 
        shall provide for the assessment of the impact of a proposed 
        export of an item on the United States defense industrial base 
        and the denial of an application for a license or a request for 
        an authorization of any export that would have a significant 
        negative impact on such defense industrial base, as described in 
        paragraph (3).
            (2) Information from applicant.--The procedure required 
        under subsection (a) shall also require an applicant for a 
        license to provide the information necessary to make the 
        assessment provided under paragraph (1), including whether the 
        purpose or effect of the export is to allow for the significant 
        production of items relevant for the defense industrial base 
        outside the United States.
            (3) Significantly negative impact defined.--A significant 
        negative impact on the United States defense industrial base is 
        the following:
                    (A) A reduction in the availability of an item 
                produced in the United States that is likely to be 
                acquired by the Department of Defense or other Federal 
                department or agency for the advancement of the national 
                security of the United States, or for the production of 
                an item in the United States for the Department of 
                Defense or other agency for the advancement of the 
                national security of the United States.

        Secretary determines is practicable. The proceeds of the

person and a hearing, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order 
requiring such person to appear and give testimony or to appear and 
produce books, records, and other writings, regardless of format, that 
are the subject of the subpoena. Any failure to obey such order of the 
court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.
    (d) Best Practice Guidelines.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
        heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, should publish and 
        update ``best practices'' guidelines to assist persons in

        export control programs in compliance with the regulations 
        issued under this part.
            (2) Export compliance program.--The implementation by a 
        person of an effective export compliance program and a high 
        quality overall export compliance effort by a person should 
        ordinarily be given weight as mitigating factors in a civil 
        penalty action against the person under this part.

    (e) Reference to Enforcement.--For purposes of this section, a 
reference to the enforcement of, or a violation of, this part includes a

                export control and sanctions systems; and

                the realignment or closure of the installation.

                the end of the fifth fiscal year after the completion of 
                the realignment or closure, the savings resulting from 
                the realignment or closure will exceed the costs of 
                carrying out the realignment or closure, together with 
                an estimate

[[Page 132 STAT. 2259]]

                exceed the costs of carrying out the realignment or 
                closure.

SEC. 3142. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COMPENSATION OF INDIVIDUALS 
                          RELATING TO URANIUM MINING AND NUCLEAR 
                          TESTING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 
        note) was enacted in 1990 to provide monetary compensation to 
        individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious 
        diseases following their exposure to radiation released during 
        atmospheric nuclear weapons testing during the Cold War or 
        following exposure to radiation as a result of employment in the 
        uranium industry during the Cold War.
            (2) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation 
        Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) formally 
        acknowledged the dangers to which some employees of sites of the 
        Department of Energy and its vendors during the Cold War were 
        exposed. That Act also acknowledged that, although establishing 
        the link between occupational hazards and specific diseases can 
        be difficult, scientific evidence exists to support the 
        conclusion that some activities related to Cold War nuclear 
        weapons production have resulted in increased risk of illness 
        and death to workers. That Act established a formal process for 
        the submission of claims for medical expenses and lump sum 
        compensation for former employees and contractors and survivors 
        of those former employees and contractors.
            (3) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, more than 
        150,231 claims have been paid out under the Radiation Exposure 
        Compensation Act and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness 
        Compensation Program Act of 2000, for a total of at least 
        $17,400,000,000 in lump sum compensation and medical expenses.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States Government should appropriately compensate and recognize the 
employees, contractors, and other individuals described in subsection 
(a).
