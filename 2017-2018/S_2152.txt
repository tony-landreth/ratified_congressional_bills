Public Law 115-299
115th Congress

                                 An Act


 
  To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for assistance for 
 victims of child pornography, and for other purposes. <<NOTE: Dec. 7, 
                          2018 -  [S. 2152]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Amy, Vicky, and 
Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018. 18 USC 1 note.>> 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child 
Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 18 USC 2259 note.>>  FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The demand for child pornography harms children because 
        it drives production, which involves severe child sexual abuse 
        and exploitation.
            (2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not 
        end, with child sex assault because child pornography is a 
        permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those images 
        compounds the harm to the child.
            (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court 
        recognized that ``every viewing of child pornography is a 
        repetition of the victim's abuse''.
            (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of 
        Children has stated that for victims of child pornography, ``the 
        sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that abuse 
        which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent distribution 
        and viewing become psychologically intertwined and each compound 
        the harm suffered by the child-victim''.
            (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result 
        of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals 
        have viewed and will in the future view images of their 
        childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason 
        that child pornography is outlawed.
            (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who 
        reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim's 
        childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and 
        aggravating the harms to that individual victim.
            (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child 
        pornography be compensated for the harms resulting from every 
        perpetrator who contributes to their anguish. Such an aggregate 
        causation standard reflects the nature of child pornography and 
        the unique ways that it actually harms victims.

SEC. 3. DETERMINING RESTITUTION.

    (a) Determining Restitution.--Section 2259(b) of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting ``Except 
                as provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and
                    (B) by striking ``as determined by the court 
                pursuant to paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's 
                losses'';
            (2) by striking paragraph (3);
            (3) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and
            (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:
            ``(2) Restitution <<NOTE: Courts.>>  for trafficking in 
        child pornography.--If the defendant was convicted of 
        trafficking in child pornography, the court shall order 
        restitution under this section in an amount to be determined by 
        the court as follows:
                    ``(A) Determining the full amount of a victim's 
                losses.--The court shall determine the full amount of 
                the victim's losses that were incurred or are reasonably 
                projected to be incurred by the victim as a result of 
                the trafficking in child pornography depicting the 
                victim.
                    ``(B) Determining a restitution amount.--After 
                completing the determination required under subparagraph 
                (A), the court shall order restitution in an amount that 
                reflects the defendant's relative role in the causal 
                process that underlies the victim's losses, but which is 
                no less than $3,000.
                    ``(C) Termination of payment.--A victim's total 
                aggregate recovery pursuant to this section shall not 
                exceed the full amount of the victim's demonstrated 
                losses. After the victim has received restitution in the 
                full amount of the victim's losses as measured by the 
                greatest amount of such losses found in any case 
                involving that victim that has resulted in a final 
                restitution order under this section, the liability of 
                each defendant who is or has been ordered to pay 
                restitution for such losses to that victim shall be 
                terminated. The court may require the victim to provide 
                information concerning the amount of restitution the 
                victim has been paid in other cases for the same 
                losses.''.

States Code, is amended--

            (3) by striking ``under this chapter, including, in the 
        case'' and inserting ``under this chapter. In the case'';
            (4) by inserting after ``or any other person appointed as 
        suitable by the court,'' the following: ``may assume the crime 
        victim's rights under this section,''; and
            (5) by inserting before paragraph (4), as so designated, the 
        following:
            ``(1) Child pornography production.--For purposes of this 
        section and section 2259A, the term `child pornography 
        production' means conduct proscribed by subsections (a) through

        be incurred in the future, by the victim, as a proximate result 
        of the offenses involving the victim, and in the case of 
        trafficking in child pornography offenses, as a proximate result 
        of all trafficking in child pornography offenses involving the 
        same victim, including--
                    ``(A) medical services relating to physical, 
                psychiatric, or psychological care;

        pornography' means conduct proscribed by section 2251(d), 2252, 
        2252A(a)(1) through (5), 2252A(g)(in cases in which the series

                defendant is convicted of trafficking in child 
                pornography, any victim of that trafficking in child

                Crime Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101(d)).

                assistance under this subsection, a court shall 
                determine whether the claimant is a victim of the

                pornography.
                    ``(C) Order.--If a court determines that a claimant
