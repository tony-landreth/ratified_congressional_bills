    ``(a) Entry of Plea of Not Guilty.--If an accused in a military 
commission under this chapter after a plea of guilty sets up matter 
inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that the accused has 
entered the plea of guilty through lack of understanding of its meaning 
and effect, or if the accused fails or refuses to plead, a plea of not 
guilty shall be entered in the record, and the military commission shall 
proceed as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.
    ``(b) Finding of Guilt After Guilty Plea.--With respect to any 
charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the 
accused in a military commission under this chapter and accepted by the 
military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification may 
be entered immediately without a vote. The finding shall constitute the 
finding of the commission unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn prior

continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.

``Sec. 949j. Opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence

    ``(a) Right <<NOTE: Regulations.>> of Defense Counsel.--Defense

        information from documents to be made available to the accused;

authorize trial counsel, in the course of complying with discovery 
obligations under this section, to protect from disclosure the sources, 
methods, or activities by which the United States acquired evidence if 
the military judge finds that the sources, methods, or activities by 
which the United States acquired such evidence are classified. The 
military judge may require trial counsel to provide, to the extent 
practicable, an unclassified summary of the sources, methods, or 
activities by which the United States acquired such evidence.
    ``(d) Exculpatory Evidence.--(1) As soon as practicable, trial 
counsel shall disclose to the defense the existence of any evidence 
known to trial counsel that reasonably tends to exculpate the accused.

with an adequate substitute in accordance with the procedures under 
subsection (c).
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `evidence known to trial 
counsel', in the case of exculpatory evidence, means exculpatory 
evidence that the prosecution would be required to disclose in a trial 
by general court-martial under chapter 47 of this title.

``Sec. 949k. Defense of lack of mental responsibility

    ``(a) Affirmative Defense.--It is an affirmative defense in a trial 
by military commission under this chapter that, at the time of the 
commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a 
result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate 
the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease 
or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.
    ``(b) Burden of Proof.--The accused in a military commission under 
this chapter has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental 
responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.
    ``(c) Findings Following Assertion of Defense.--Whenever lack of 
mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is 
properly at issue in a military commission under this chapter, the 
military judge shall instruct the members of the commission as to the 
defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and shall 
charge them to find the accused--

            ``(3) subject to subsection (d), not guilty by reason of 
        lack of mental responsibility.

    ``(d) Majority Vote Required for Finding.--The accused shall be 
found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility under 
subsection (c)(3) only if a majority of the members present at the time 
the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental 
responsibility has been established.

``Sec. 949l. Voting and rulings

    ``(2) Any ruling made by the military judge upon a question of law 
or an interlocutory question (other than the factual issue of mental 
responsibility of the accused) is conclusive and constitutes the ruling

enactment, but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military 
commission.

declarative of existing law, they do not preclude trial for crimes that 
occurred before the date of the enactment of this chapter.

        by him would be punishable by this chapter; or
