        from a qualified investment entity (as defined in section 
        897(h)(4)) to a nonresident alien individual or a foreign 
        corporation is treated under section 897(h)(1) as gain realized 
        by such individual or corporation from the sale or exchange of a 
        United States real property interest, the qualified investment 
        entity shall deduct and withhold under subsection (a) a tax 
        equal to 35 percent (or, to the extent provided in regulations,
