Right to Financial Privacy Act, or section 802(a) of the National 
Security Act of 1947 may, in the United States district court for the 
district in which that person or entity does business or resides, 
petition for an order modifying or setting aside the request. The court 
may modify or set aside the request if compliance would be unreasonable, 
oppressive, or otherwise unlawful.
    ``(b)(1) The recipient of a request for records, a report, or other 
information under section 2709(b) of this title, section 626(a) or (b)

finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger 
the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, 
counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with 
diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any 
person. If, at the time of the petition, the Attorney General, Deputy 
Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or the Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, or in the case of a request by a 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government other 
than the Department of Justice, the head or deputy head of such

disclosure may result in a danger to the national security of the United 
States, interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or 
counterintelligence investigation, interference with diplomatic 
relations, or danger to the life or physical safety of any person. In 
the event of re-certification, the court may modify or set aside such a 
nondisclosure requirement if it finds that there is no reason to believe 
that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, 
interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence 
investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life 
or physical safety of any person. If the recertification that disclosure 
may endanger the national security of the United States or interfere 
with diplomatic relations is made by the Attorney General, Deputy 
Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General, or the Director of the

order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt thereof. Any 
process under this section may be served in any judicial district in 
which the person or entity may be found.
    ``(d) In all proceedings under this section, subject to any right to 
an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any
