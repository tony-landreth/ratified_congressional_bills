SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``James Campbell National Wildlife 
Refuge Expansion Act of 2005''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the 
        James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge for the purpose of 
        promoting the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian 
        waterbirds;
            (2) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service leases 
        approximately 240 acres of high-value wetland habitat (including 
        ponds, marshes, freshwater springs, and adjacent land) and 
        manages the habitat in accordance with the National Wildlife 
        Refuge System Improvement Act (16 U.S.C. 668dd note; Public Law 
        105-312);
            (3) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service entered into 
        a contract to purchase in fee title the land described in 
        paragraph (2) from the estate of James Campbell for the purposes 
        of--
                    (A) permanently protecting the endangered species 
                habitat; and
                    (B) improving the management of the Refuge;
            (4) the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has 
        identified for inclusion in the Refuge approximately 800 acres 
        of additional high-value wildlife habitat adjacent to the Refuge 
        that are owned by the estate of James Campbell;
            (5) the land of the estate of James Campbell on the Kahuku 
        Coast features coastal dunes, coastal wetlands, and coastal 
        strand that promote biological diversity for threatened and 
        endangered species, including--
                    (A) the 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds 
                described in paragraph (1);
                    (B) migratory shorebirds;
                    (C) waterfowl;
                    (D) seabirds;
                    (E) endangered and native plant species;
                    (F) endangered monk seals; and
                    (G) green sea turtles;

[[Page 120 STAT. 379]]

            (6) because of extensive coastal development, habitats of 
        the type within the Refuge are increasingly rare on the Hawaiian 
        islands;
            (7) expanding the Refuge will provide increased 
        opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses, including 
        wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education 
        and interpretation; and
            (8) acquisition of the land described in paragraph (4)--
                    (A) will create a single, large, manageable, and 
                ecologically-intact unit that includes sufficient buffer 
                land to reduce impacts on the Refuge; and
                    (B) is necessary to reduce flood damage following 
                heavy rainfall to residences, businesses, and public 
                buildings in the town of Kahuku.
