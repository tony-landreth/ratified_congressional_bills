        under section 1866A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1395cc-1). Under such methodology, 80 percent of the reductions 
        in expenditures under title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
        resulting from participation of individuals that are 
        attributable to the medical home (as reduced by the total care 
        managements fees paid to the medical home under the project) 
        shall be paid to the medical home. The amount of such reductions 
        in expenditures shall be determined by using assumptions with

        hospitalization rates, medical errors, and adverse drug 
        reactions.
            (3) Source.--Payments paid under the project shall be made

        the project and shall submit to Congress, by a date specified by 
        the Secretary, a report on the project and on the evaluation of 
        the project for each such year.
            (2) Final evaluation and report.--The Secretary shall 
        provide for an evaluation of the project and shall submit to 
        Congress, not later than one year after completion of the

            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the land designated as wilderness by this 
                subtitle is located--

[[Page 120 STAT. 3034]]

                          (i) in the semiarid region of the Great Basin; 
                      and
                          (ii) at the headwaters of the streams and 
                      rivers on land with respect to which there are few 
                      if any--
                                    (I) actual or proposed water 
                                resource facilities located upstream; 
                                and
                                    (II) opportunities for diversion, 
                                storage, or other uses of water 
                                occurring outside the land that would 
                                adversely affect the wilderness values 
                                of the land;
                    (B) the land designated as wilderness by this 
                subtitle is generally not suitable for use or 
                development of new water resource facilities; and
                    (C) because of the unique nature of the land 
                designated as wilderness by this subtitle, it is 
                possible to provide for proper management and protection 
                of the wilderness and other values of land in ways 
                different from those used in other laws.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to protect the 
        wilderness values of the land designated as wilderness by this 
        subtitle by means other than a federally reserved water right.
            (3) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this subtitle--
                    (A) shall constitute or be construed to constitute 
                either an express or implied reservation by the United 
                States of any water or water rights with respect to a 
                wilderness designated by this subtitle;
                    (B) shall affect any water rights in the State 
                (including any water rights held by the United States) 
                in existence on the date of enactment of this Act;
                    (C) shall be construed as establishing a precedent 
                with regard to any future wilderness designations;
                    (D) shall affect the interpretation of, or any 
                designation made pursuant to, any other Act; or
                    (E) shall be construed as limiting, altering, 
                modifying, or amending any interstate compact or 
                equitable apportionment decree that apportions water 
                among and between the State and other States.
            (4) Nevada water law.--The Secretary shall follow the 
        procedural and substantive requirements of State law in order to 
        obtain and hold any water rights not in existence on the date of 
        enactment of this Act with respect to the wilderness areas 
        designated by this subtitle.
            (5) New projects.--
                    (A) Definition of water resource facility.--In this 
                paragraph, the term ``water resource facility''--
                          (i) means irrigation and pumping facilities, 
                      reservoirs, water conservation works, aqueducts, 
                      canals, ditches, pipelines, wells, hydropower 
                      projects, transmission and other ancillary 
                      facilities, and other water diversion, storage, 
                      and carriage structures; and
                          (ii) does not include wildlife guzzlers.
                    (B) Restriction on new water resource facilities.--
                Except as otherwise provided in this title, on or after 
                the date of enactment of this Act, neither the President 
                nor any other officer, employee, or agent of the United 
                States shall fund, assist, authorize, or issue a license 
                or permit for the development of any new water resource

[[Page 120 STAT. 3035]]

                facility within a wilderness area that is wholly or

                threatened and endangered species;
            (3) forest land and rangeland in the Great Basin are 
        degraded as a direct consequence of land management practices 
        (including practices to control and prevent wildfires) that 
        disrupt the occurrence of frequent low-intensity fires that have 
        periodically removed flammable undergrowth; and
            (4) additional scientific information is needed in the Great 
        Basin for--
                    (A) the design, implementation, and adaptation of

SEC. 3012. EFFECTIVE DATE OF MODIFICATIONS TO THE HARMONIZED TARIFF

    Section 1206(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(19 U.S.C. 3006(c)) is amended by striking ``15<SUP>th</SUP>'' and

    TITLE IV--EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT (NORMAL TRADE 
             RELATIONS TREATMENT) TO THE PRODUCTS OF VIETNAM

SEC. 4001. <<NOTE: 19 USC 2434 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In July 1995, President Bill Clinton announced the 
        formal normalization of diplomatic relations between the United 
        States and Vietnam.
            (2) Vietnam has taken cooperative steps with the United 
        States under the United States Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command 
        (formerly the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting)

[[Page 120 STAT. 3178]]

        established in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush to provide the 
        fullest possible accounting of MIA and POW cases.
            (3) In 2000, the United States and Vietnam concluded a 
        bilateral trade agreement that included commitments on goods, 
        services, intellectual property rights, and investment. The 
        agreement was approved by joint resolution enacted pursuant to 
        section 405(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(c)), and 
        entered into force in December 2001.
            (4) Since 2001, normal trade relations treatment has 
        consistently been extended to Vietnam pursuant to title IV of 
        the Trade Act of 1974.
            (5) Vietnam has undertaken significant market-based economic 
        reforms, including the reduction of government subsidies, 
        tariffs and nontariff barriers, and extensive legal reform. 
        These measures have dramatically improved Vietnam's business and 
        investment climate.
            (6) Vietnam has completed its negotiations to join the World 
        Trade Organization (WTO). On May 31, 2006, the United States and 
        Vietnam signed a comprehensive bilateral agreement providing 
        greater market access for goods and services and other trade 
        liberalizing commitments. On November 7, 2006, the WTO General 
        Council approved Vietnam's membership. Vietnam's National 
        Assembly ratified Vietnam's WTO accession commitments on 
        November 28, 2006, and Vietnam will become the 150th Member of 
        the WTO 30 days thereafter.
            (7) On November 13, 2006, the Department of State removed 
        Vietnam from its list of Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) 
        for severe violations of religious freedom. In reaching this 
        determination, the Department of State cited significant 
        improvements in Vietnam toward advancing religious freedom, 
        though problems remain that merit immediate attention and 
        important work remains to be done to fully protect religious 
        freedom in Vietnam.

        Vietnam; and

        respect to Vietnam, proclaim the extension of nondiscriminatory 
        treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of 
        that country.

    (b) Termination of the Applicability of Title IV.--On and after the 
effective date of the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the 
products of Vietnam under subsection (a), title IV of the Trade Act of 
1974 shall cease to apply to that country.
