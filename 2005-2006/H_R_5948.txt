    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: Belarus 
Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006.>> 
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 22 USC 5801 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act 
of 2006''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Section 2 of the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 5811 note) 
is amended to read as follows:
``SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) The Government of the Republic of Belarus has engaged 
        in a pattern of clear and uncorrected violations of human rights 
        and fundamental freedoms.
            ``(2) The Government of Belarus has engaged in a pattern of 
        clear and uncorrected violations of basic principles of 
        democratic governance, including through a series of 
        fundamentally flawed presidential and parliamentary elections 
        undermining the legitimacy of executive and legislative 
        authority in that country.
            ``(3) The most recent presidential elections in Belarus held 
        on March 19, 2006, failed to meet the commitments of the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for 
        democratic elections and the arbitrary use of state power and 
        widespread detentions show a disregard for the basic rights of 
        freedom of assembly, association, and expression, and raise 
        doubts regarding the willingness of authorities in Belarus to 
        tolerate political competition.
            ``(4) The regime of Aleksandr Lukashenka has maintained 
        power in Belarus by orchestrating an illegal and 
        unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new 
        constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the 13th 
        Supreme Soviet, install a largely powerless National Assembly, 
        extend his term of office, and remove applicable term limits.
            ``(5) The Government of Belarus has failed to make a 
        credible effort to solve the cases of disappeared opposition 
        figures Yuri Zakharenka, Viktor Gonchar, and Anatoly Krasovsky 
        in 1999 and journalist Dmitry Zavadsky in 2000, even though 
        credible allegations and evidence exist linking top officials of 
        the Lukashenka regime with these disappearances.

[[Page 120 STAT. 3667]]

            ``(6) Political opposition figures Aleksandr Kozulin, 
        Tsimafei Dranchuk, Mikalay Astreyka, Artur Finkevich, Mikalay 
        Razumau, Katsyaryna Sadouskaya, Zmitser Dashkevich, Mikhail 
        Marynich, Mikalay Statkevych, Pavel Sevyarinets, Andrei Klimau, 
        Valery Levaneusky, and Siarhei Skrebets have been imprisoned or 
        served `corrective labor' sentences because of their political 
        activity.
            ``(7) Hundreds of pro-democratic political activists have 
        been subjected to frequent harassment and jailings, especially 
        during, and in the aftermath of the fatally flawed March 19, 
        2006, presidential elections in Belarus.
            ``(8) The Government of Belarus has attempted to maintain a 
        monopoly over the country's information space, targeting 
        independent media for systematic reprisals and elimination, 
        while suppressing the right to freedom of speech and expression 
        of those dissenting from the regime.
            ``(9) The Belarusian authorities have perpetuated a climate 
        of fear in Belarus by mounting a systematic crackdown on civil 
        society through the harassment, repression, and closure of 
        nongovernmental organizations and independent trade unions.
            ``(10) The Lukashenka regime has increasingly subjected 
        leaders and members of minority and unregistered religious 
        communities to harassment, including the imposition of heavy 
        fines, denying permission to meet for religious services, 
        prosecutions, and jail terms for activities in the practice of 
        their faith.
            ``(11) The Belarusian authorities have further attempted to 
        silence dissent through retribution against human rights and 
        pro-democracy activists through threats, firings, expulsions, 
        beatings and other forms of intimidation.''.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

        March 19, 2006, presidential elections held in Belarus and 
        support the call for new presidential elections;
            ``(6) to refuse to recognize any possible referendum, or the
