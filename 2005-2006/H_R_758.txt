                                 An Act


 
   To establish an interagency aerospace revitalization task force to 
    develop a national strategy for aerospace workforce recruitment, 
    training, and cultivation. <<NOTE: Dec. 20, 2006 -  [H.R. 758]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The aerospace industry generates nearly 15 percent of 
        the gross domestic product of the United States, supports 
        approximately 11,000,000 jobs in the United States, and leads 
        the United States economy in net exports.
            (2) The aerospace industry contributes directly to the 
        economic and national security of the United States through 
        military, space, air transport, and information technology 
        applications.
            (3) A skilled and educated workforce represents the most 
        valuable asset of the United States economy.
            (4) In 2004, total employment in the aerospace industry fell 
        to its lowest point in 50 years.
            (5) 27 percent of the aerospace manufacturing workforce will 
        become eligible for retirement by 2008.
            (6) Students in the United States rank near the bottom of 
        the leading industrialized countries of the world in mathematics 
        and science test performance.
            (7) To ensure the stability of high-skilled jobs and the 
        global competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry, the 
        United States requires coordinated Federal Government policies 
        to sustain and expand the science, mathematics, engineering, and 
        manufacturing workforce.
