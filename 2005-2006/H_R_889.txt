    (c) <<NOTE: 33 USC 2704 note.>> Report.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 45 days after the date

        Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
        Representatives.
            (2) Contents.--The report shall include, at a minimum, the 
        following:
                    (A) An analysis of the extent to which oil 
                discharges from vessels and nonvessel sources have or 
                are likely to result in removal costs and damages (as 
                defined in section 1001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
                (33 U.S.C. 2701)) for which no defense to liability

                    (C) Based on analyses under this paragraph and 
                taking into account other factors impacting the Fund, 
                recommendations on whether the liability limits need to 
                be adjusted in order to prevent the principal of the 
                Fund from declining to levels that are likely to be 
                insufficient to cover expected claims.
            (3) Annual updates.--The Secretary shall provide an update 
        of the report to the Committees referred to in paragraph (1) on 
        an annual basis.
