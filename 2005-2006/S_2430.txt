109th Congress

                                 An Act


 
 To amend the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990 to 
provide for implementation of recommendations of the United States Fish 
  and Wildlife Service contained in the Great Lakes Fishery Resources 
        Restoration Study. <<NOTE: Oct. 11, 2006 -  [S. 2430]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Great Lakes Fish and 
Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006.>> assembled,

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 16 USC 941 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife 
Restoration Act of 2006''.

SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 941 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Great Lakes have fish and wildlife communities that 
        are structurally and functionally changing;
            (2) successful fish and wildlife management focuses on the 
        lakes as ecosystems, and effective management requires the 
        coordination and integration of efforts of many partners;
            (3) it is in the national interest to undertake activities 
        in the Great Lakes Basin that support sustainable fish and 
        wildlife resources of common concern provided under the 
        recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration 
        authorized under Executive Order 13340 (69 Fed. Reg. 29043; 
        relating to the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force);
            (4) additional actions and better coordination are needed to 
        protect and effectively manage the fish and wildlife resources, 
        and the habitats upon which the resources depend, in the Great 
        Lakes Basin;
            (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, actions are not 
        funded that are considered essential to meet the goals and 
        objectives in managing the fish and wildlife resources, and the 
        habitats upon which the resources depend, in the Great Lakes 
        Basin; and
            (6) the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (16 
        U.S.C. 941 et seq.) allows Federal agencies, States, and tribes 
        to work in an effective partnership by providing the funding for 
        restoration work.
