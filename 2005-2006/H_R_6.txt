                be computed on a percentage of the gross proceeds from 
                the sale of electricity, at a royalty rate that is 
                expected to yield total royalty payments equivalent to 
                payments that would have been received for comparable 
                production under the royalty rate in effect for the 
                lease before the date of enactment of this subsection.

        insular areas of the United States, and for other purposes'', 
        approved December 24, 1980 (48 U.S.C. 1492), as having the 
        potential to--
                    (A) significantly reduce the dependence of an 
                insular area on imported fossil fuels; or
                    (B) provide needed distributed generation to an 
                insular area.
            (2) Request.--The Secretary shall conduct a feasibility 
        study under paragraph (1) on--
                    (A) the request of an electric utility located in an 
                insular area that commits to fund at least 10 percent of 
                the cost of the study; and
                    (B) if the electric utility is located in the 
                Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the 
                Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau, written 
                support for that request by the President or the

                (1); and
                    (B) determining the feasibility of potential 
                projects.
            (4) Feasibility.--For the purpose of a feasibility study 
        under paragraph (1), a project shall be determined to be 
        feasible if the project would significantly reduce the 
        dependence of an insular area on imported fossil fuels, or 
        provide needed distributed generation to an insular area, at a 
        reasonable cost.

    (b) Implementation.--
            (1) In general.--On a determination by the Secretary (in 
        consultation with the Secretary of the Interior) that a project

[[Page 119 STAT. 683]]

        is feasible under subsection (a) and a commitment by an electric 
        utility to operate and maintain the project, the Secretary may 
        provide such technical and financial assistance as the Secretary 
        determines is appropriate for the implementation of the project.
            (2) Regional utility organizations.--In providing assistance 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider providing the 
        assistance through regional utility organizations.

    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--
            (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated to 
        the Secretary--
                    (A) $500,000 for each fiscal year for project

                    (B) $4,000,000 for each fiscal year for project 
                implementation under subsection (b).
            (2) Limitation of funds received by insular areas.--No 
        insular area may receive, during any 3-year period, more than 20 
        percent of the total funds made available during that 3-year 
        period under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) unless 
        the Secretary determines that providing funding in excess of 
        that percentage best advances existing opportunities to meet the 
        objectives of this section.

        account.

    (d) Limitation.--Funds in the lease revenue account shall not exceed 
$3,000,000 at any one time. Whenever funds in the lease revenue account 
are obligated or expended so that the balance in the account falls below 
that amount, lease revenues referred to in subsection (c)(2) shall be 
deposited in the account to maintain a balance of $3,000,000.
    (e) Termination of Account.--At <<NOTE: Certification.>> such time

        the amount delivered, except that transportation and processing 
        reimbursements paid to, or deductions claimed by, the lessee 
        shall be subject to review and audit.

                field or area in which the royalty production was 
                produced.
                    (B) Requirement.--Royalty production shall be placed 
                in marketable condition by the lessee at no cost to the

        and gas taken in-kind that otherwise would be deposited to 
        miscellaneous receipts, without regard to fiscal year 
        limitation, or may use oil or gas received as royalty taken in-
        kind (referred to in this paragraph as ``royalty production'') 
        to pay the cost of--
                    (A) transporting the royalty production;
                    (B) processing the royalty production;
                    (C) disposing of the royalty production; or
                    (D) any combination of transporting, processing, and

                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), the Secretary may not use revenues from the sale of 
                oil and gas taken in-kind to pay for personnel, travel, 
                or other administrative costs of the Federal Government.
                    (B) Exception.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), 
                the Secretary may use a portion of the revenues from

                to pay salaries and other administrative costs directly 
                related to the royalty in-kind program.

    (c) Reimbursement of Cost.--If the lessee, pursuant to an agreement 
with the United States or as provided in the lease, processes the 
royalty gas or delivers the royalty oil or gas at a point not on or 
adjacent to the lease area, the Secretary shall--

[[Page 119 STAT. 699]]

            (1) reimburse the lessee for the reasonable costs of 
        transportation (not including gathering) from the lease to the 
        point of delivery or for processing costs; or
            (2) allow the lessee to deduct the transportation or 
        processing costs in reporting and paying royalties in-value for 
        other Federal oil and gas leases.

    (d) Benefit to the United States Required.--The Secretary may 
receive oil or gas royalties in-kind only if the Secretary determines 
that receiving royalties in-kind provides benefits to the United States 
that are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have 
been received had royalties been taken in-value.
    (e) Reports.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than September 30, 2006, the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that addresses--
                    (A) actions taken to develop business processes and 
                automated systems to fully support the royalty-in-kind 
                capability to be used in tandem with the royalty-in-
                value approach in managing Federal oil and gas revenue; 
                and
                    (B) future royalty-in-kind businesses operation 
                plans and objectives.
            (2) Reports on oil or gas royalties taken in-kind.--For each

        takes oil or gas royalties in-kind from production in any State 
        or from the outer Continental Shelf, excluding royalties taken 
        in-kind and sold to refineries under subsection (h), the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes--
                    (A) the 1 or more methodologies used by the 
                Secretary to determine compliance with subsection (d), 
                including the performance standard for comparing amounts 
                received by the United States derived from royalties in-
                kind to amounts likely to have been received had 
                royalties been taken in-value;
                    (B) an explanation of the evaluation that led the 
                Secretary to take royalties in-kind from a lease or 
                group of leases, including the expected revenue effect 
                of taking royalties in-kind;
                    (C) actual amounts received by the United States 
                derived from taking royalties in-kind and costs and 
                savings incurred by the United States associated with 
                taking royalties in-kind, including administrative 
                savings and any new or increased administrative costs; 
                and
                    (D) an evaluation of other relevant public benefits 
                or detriments associated with taking royalties in-kind.

    (f) Deduction of Expenses.--
            (1) In general.--Before making payments under section 35 of 
        the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) or section 8(g) of the 
        Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g)) of 
        revenues derived from the sale of royalty production taken in-
        kind from a lease, the Secretary shall deduct amounts paid or 
        deducted under subsections (b)(4) and (c) and deposit the amount 
        of the deductions in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.
            (2) Accounting for deductions.--When the Secretary allows 
        the lessee to deduct transportation or processing costs under 
        subsection (c), the Secretary may not reduce any payments to 
        recipients of revenues derived from any other Federal oil and 
        gas lease as a consequence of that deduction.

[[Page 119 STAT. 700]]

    (g) Consultation With States.--The Secretary--
            (1) shall consult with a State before conducting a royalty 
        in-kind program under this subtitle within the State;
            (2) may delegate management of any portion of the Federal 
        royalty in-kind program to the State except as otherwise 
        prohibited by Federal law; and
            (3) shall consult annually with any State from which Federal 
        oil or gas royalty is being taken in-kind to ensure, to the 
        maximum extent practicable, that the royalty in-kind program 
        provides revenues to the State greater than or equal to the 
        revenues likely to have been received had royalties been taken 
        in-value.

    (h) Small Refineries.--
            (1) Preference.--If the Secretary finds that sufficient 
        supplies of crude oil are not available in the open market to 
        refineries that do not have their own source of supply for crude 
        oil, the Secretary may grant preference to those refineries in 
        the sale of any royalty oil accruing or reserved to the United 
        States under Federal oil and gas leases issued under any mineral 
        leasing law, for processing or use in those refineries at 
        private sale at not less than the market price.
            (2) Proration among refineries in production area.--In 
        disposing of oil under this subsection, the Secretary may, at 
        the discretion of the Secretary, prorate the oil among 
        refineries described in paragraph (1) in the area in which the 
        oil is produced.

    (i) Disposition to Federal Agencies.--
            (1) Onshore royalty.--Any royalty oil or gas taken by the 
        Secretary in-kind from onshore oil and gas leases may be sold at 
        not less than the market price to any Federal agency.
            (2) Offshore royalty.--Any royalty oil or gas taken in-kind 
        from a Federal oil or gas lease on the outer Continental Shelf 
        may be disposed of only under section 27 of the Outer 
        Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1353).

    (j) Federal Low-Income Energy Assistance Programs.--
            (1) Preference.--In disposing of royalty oil or gas taken 
        in-kind under this section, the Secretary may grant a preference 
        to any person, including any Federal or State agency, for the 
        purpose of providing additional resources to any Federal low-
        income energy assistance program.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to 
        Congress--
                    (A) assessing the effectiveness of granting 
                preferences specified in paragraph (1); and
                    (B) providing a specific recommendation on the 
                continuation of authority to grant preferences.

unit or communitization agreement, that produces on average the combined 
equivalent of less than 15 barrels of oil per well per day or 90,000,000 
British thermal units of gas per

[[Page 119 STAT. 701]]

well per day calculated based on the average over the 3 most recent 
production months, including only wells that produce on more than half 
of the days during those 3 production months.

    Section 27(d)(1) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 184(d)(1)) is 
amended by inserting after ``acreage held in special tar sand areas'' 
the following: ``, and acreage under any lease any portion of which has 
been committed to a federally approved unit or cooperative plan or 
communitization agreement or for which royalty (including compensatory 
royalty or royalty in-kind) was paid in the preceding calendar year,''.

SEC. 353. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15909.>> GAS HYDRATE PRODUCTION INCENTIVE.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to promote natural gas 
production from the natural gas hydrate resources on the outer 
Continental Shelf and Federal lands in Alaska by providing royalty 
incentives.
    (b) Suspension of Royalties.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may grant royalty relief in 
        accordance with this section for natural gas produced from gas 
        hydrate resources under an eligible lease.
            (2) Eligible leases.--A lease shall be an eligible lease for 
        purposes of this section if--
                    (A) it is issued under the Outer Continental Shelf 
                Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), or is an oil and gas 
                lease issued for onshore Federal lands in Alaska;
                    (B) it is issued prior to January 1, 2016; and
                    (C) production under the lease of natural gas from 
                gas hydrate resources commences prior to January 1, 
                2018.
            (3) Amount of relief.--The Secretary shall conduct a 
        rulemaking and grant royalty relief under this section as a 
        suspension volume if the Secretary determines that such royalty 
        relief would encourage production of natural gas from gas 
        hydrate resources from an eligible lease. The maximum suspension 
        volume shall be 30 billion cubic feet of natural gas per lease. 
        Such relief shall be in addition to any other royalty relief 
        under any other provision applicable to the lease that does not 
        specifically grant a gas hydrate production incentive. Such 
        royalty suspension volume shall be applied to any eligible 
        production occurring on or after the date of publication of the 
        advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.
            (4) Limitation.--The Secretary may place limitations on 
        royalty relief granted under this section based on market price.

    (c) Application.--This section shall apply to any eligible lease 
issued before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act.
    (d) Rulemakings.--
            (1) Requirement.--
        The <<NOTE: Publication. Notices. Deadlines.>> Secretary shall 
        publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180

and on Federal lands in Alaska through the provision of other production 
incentives or through technical or financial assistance.

SEC. 354. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15910.>> ENHANCED OIL AND NATURAL GAS 
            PRODUCTION THROUGH CARBON DIOXIDE INJECTION.

    (a) Production Incentive.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Approximately two-thirds of the original oil in 
                place in the United States remains unproduced.
                    (B) Enhanced oil and natural gas production from the 
                sequestering of carbon dioxide and other appropriate 
                gases has the potential to increase oil and natural gas 
                production.
                    (C) Capturing and productively using carbon dioxide 
                would help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is--
                    (A) to promote the capturing, transportation, and 
                injection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon 
                dioxide, and other appropriate gases or other matter for 
                sequestration into oil and gas fields; and
                    (B) to promote oil and natural gas production from 
                the outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal lands 
                under lease by providing royalty incentives to use 
                enhanced recovery techniques using injection of the 
                substances referred to in subparagraph (A).

    (b) Suspension of Royalties.--
            (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that reduction 
        of the royalty under a Federal oil and gas lease that is an 
        eligible lease is in the public interest and promotes the 
        purposes of this section, the Secretary shall undertake a 
        rulemaking to provide for such reduction for an eligible lease.
            (2) Rulemakings.--
        The <<NOTE: Publication. Notices. Deadlines.>> Secretary shall 
        publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 
        days after the date of enactment of this Act and complete the 
        rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Eligible leases.--A lease shall be an eligible lease for 
        purposes of this section if--
                    (A) it is a lease for production of oil and gas from 
                the outer Continental Shelf or Federal onshore lands;
                    (B) the injection of the substances referred to in 
                subsection (a)(2)(A) will be used as an enhanced 
                recovery technique on such lease; and
                    (C) the Secretary determines that the lease contains 
                oil or gas that would not likely be produced without the 
                royalty reduction provided under this section.

[[Page 119 STAT. 716]]

            (4) Amount of relief.--The rulemaking shall provide for a 
        suspension volume, which shall not exceed 5,000,000 barrels of 
        oil equivalent for each eligible lease. Such suspension volume 
        shall be applied to any production from an eligible lease 
        occurring on or after the date of publication of any advanced 
        notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection.
            (5) Limitation.--The Secretary may place limitations on the 
        royalty reduction granted under this section based on market 
        price.
            (6) Application.--This section shall apply to any eligible 
        lease issued before, on, or after the date of enactment of this 
        Act.

    (c) Demonstration Program.--

SEC. 373. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF MINERALS UNDER 
            PADRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pursuant to Public Law 87-712 (16 U.S.C. 459d et seq.; 
        popularly known as the ``Federal Enabling Act'') and various 
        deeds and actions under that Act, the United States is the owner 
        of only the surface estate of certain lands constituting the 
        Padre Island National Seashore.
            (2) Ownership of the oil, gas, and other minerals in the 
        subsurface estate of the lands constituting the Padre Island 
        National Seashore was never acquired by the United States, and 
        ownership of those interests is held by the State of Texas and 
        private parties.
            (3) Public Law 87-712 (16 U.S.C. 459d et seq.)--
                    (A) expressly contemplated that the United States 
                would recognize the ownership and future development of 
                the oil, gas, and other minerals in the subsurface 
                estate of the lands constituting the Padre Island 
                National Seashore by the owners and their mineral 
                lessees; and
                    (B) recognized that approval of the State of Texas 
                was required to create Padre Island National Seashore.
            (4) Approval was given for the creation of Padre Island 
        National Seashore by the State of Texas through Tex. Rev. Civ. 
        Stat. Ann. Art. 6077(t) (Vernon 1970), which expressly 
        recognized that development of the oil, gas, and other minerals 
        in the subsurface of the lands constituting Padre Island 
        National Seashore would be conducted with full rights of ingress 
        and egress under the laws of the State of Texas.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that with regard 
to Federal law, any regulation of the development of oil, gas, or other 
minerals in the subsurface of the lands constituting Padre Island 
National Seashore should be made as if those lands retained the status 
that the lands had on September 27, 1962.

regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe. Not later 
than 180 days after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey the remaining mineral 
rights to the parties who as of the date of enactment of the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 would be recognized as holders of a right, title, or 
interest to any portion of such minerals under the laws of the State of 
Louisiana, but for the interest of the United States in such minerals.
    ``(c) Oil and Gas <<NOTE: Deadlines.>> Resource Assessment and 
Report.--The United States Geological Survey shall conduct a resource 
assessment and publish a report of the findings of such resource 
assessment (`USGS Assessment and Report') within 1 year of the date of 
enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The USGS Assessment and 
Report shall provide an assessment of all oil and gas resources 
underlying the certain lands in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, as 
described in section 103 (the `Livingston Parish lands'). Upon a finding 
by the Secretary of the Interior based upon the USGS Assessment and 
Report that it is unlikely that economically recoverable oil and gas 
resources are present, the Secretary shall convey all rights to oil and 
gas underlying such lands to the recipients, or their successors, heirs, 
or assigns, of the conveyances under subsection (b). Such further 
conveyances shall be made within 180 days after a finding by the

SEC. 390. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15942.>> NEPA REVIEW.

    (a) NEPA Review.--Action by the Secretary of the Interior in 
managing the public lands, or the Secretary of Agriculture in managing 
National Forest System Lands, with respect to any of the activities 
described in subsection (b) shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption 
that the use of a categorical exclusion under

[[Page 119 STAT. 748]]

the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) would apply if the 
activity is conducted pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act for the 
purpose of exploration or development of oil or gas.
    (b) Activities Described.--The activities referred to in subsection 
(a) are the following:
            (1) Individual surface disturbances of less than 5 acres so 
        long as the total surface disturbance on the lease is not 
        greater than 150 acres and site-specific analysis in a document 
        prepared pursuant to NEPA has been previously completed.
            (2) Drilling an oil or gas well at a location or well pad 
        site at which drilling has occurred previously within 5 years 
        prior to the date of spudding the well.
            (3) Drilling an oil or gas well within a developed field for 
        which an approved land use plan or any environmental document 
        prepared pursuant to NEPA analyzed such drilling as a reasonably 
        foreseeable activity, so long as such plan or document was 
        approved within 5 years prior to the date of spudding the well.
            (4) Placement of a pipeline in an approved right-of-way 
        corridor, so long as the corridor was approved within 5 years 
        prior to the date of placement of the pipeline.
            (5) Maintenance of a minor activity, other than any 
        construction or major renovation or a building or facility.

                   Subtitle H--Refinery Revitalization

SEC. 391. <<NOTE: 42 USC 15951.>> FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) it serves the national interest to increase petroleum 
        refining capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, jet 
        fuel, kerosene, and petrochemical feedstocks wherever located 
        within the United States, to bring more supply to the markets 
        for the use of the American people;
            (2) United States demand for refined petroleum products 
        currently exceeds the country's petroleum refining capacity to 
        produce such products;
            (3) this excess demand has been met with increased imports;
            (4) due to lack of capacity, refined petroleum product 
        imports are expected to grow from 7.9 percent to 10.7 percent of 
        total refined product by 2025;
            (5) refiners are still subject to significant environmental 
        and other regulations and face several new requirements under 
        the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) over the next decade; 
        and
            (6) better coordination of Federal and State regulatory 
        reviews may help facilitate siting and construction of new 
        refineries to meet the demand in the United States for refined 
        products.

    (b) Definitions.--In this subtitle:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the

                appropriate steps to gain recognition in Canada and 
                Mexico.

    ``(d) Reliability Standards.--(1) The Electric Reliability 
Organization shall file each reliability standard or modification to a 
reliability standard that it proposes to be made effective under this 
section with the Commission.
    ``(2) The Commission may approve, by rule or order, a proposed 
reliability standard or modification to a reliability standard if it 
determines that the standard is just, reasonable, not unduly 
discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest. The 
Commission shall give due weight to the technical expertise of the 
Electric Reliability Organization with respect to the content of a 
proposed standard or modification to a reliability standard and to the 
technical expertise of a regional entity organized on an 
Interconnection-wide basis with respect to a reliability standard to be 
applicable within that Interconnection, but shall not defer with respect 
to the effect of a standard on competition. A proposed standard or 
modification shall take effect upon approval by the Commission.
    ``(3) The Electric Reliability Organization shall rebuttably presume 
that a proposal from a regional entity organized on an Interconnection-
wide basis for a reliability standard or modification to a reliability 
standard to be applicable on an Interconnection-wide basis is just, 
reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the 
public interest.
    ``(4) The Commission shall remand to the Electric Reliability 
Organization for further consideration a proposed reliability standard 
or a modification to a reliability standard that the Commission 
disapproves in whole or in part.
    ``(5) The Commission, upon its own motion or upon complaint, may 
order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit to the Commission 
a proposed reliability standard or a modification to a reliability 
standard that addresses a specific matter if the Commission considers 
such a new or modified reliability standard appropriate to carry out 
this section.
    ``(6) The final rule adopted under subsection (b)(2) shall include 
fair processes for the identification and timely resolution of any 
conflict between a reliability standard and any function, rule, order, 
tariff, rate schedule, or agreement accepted, approved, or ordered by 
the Commission applicable to a transmission organization. Such 
transmission organization shall continue to comply with such function, 
rule, order, tariff, rate schedule or agreement accepted, approved, or 
ordered by the Commission until--
            ``(A) the Commission finds a conflict exists between a 
        reliability standard and any such provision;
            ``(B) the Commission orders a change to such provision 
        pursuant to section 206 of this part; and
            ``(C) the ordered change becomes effective under this part.

If the Commission determines that a reliability standard needs to be 
changed as a result of such a conflict, it shall order the ERO to 
develop and file with the Commission a modified reliability standard 
under paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection.
    ``(e) Enforcement.--(1) The ERO may impose, subject to paragraph 
(2), a penalty on a user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system 
for a violation of a reliability standard approved by the Commission 
under subsection (d) if the ERO, after notice and an opportunity for a 
hearing--

[[Page 119 STAT. 944]]

            ``(A) finds that the user or owner or operator has violated 
        a reliability standard approved by the Commission under 
        subsection (d); and
            ``(B) files notice and the record of the proceeding with the 
        Commission.

    ``(2) A penalty imposed under paragraph (1) may take effect not 
earlier than the 31st day after the ERO files with the Commission notice 
of the penalty and the record of proceedings. Such penalty shall be 
subject to review by the Commission, on its own motion or upon 
application by the user, owner or operator that is the subject of the 
penalty filed within 30 days after the date such notice is filed with 
the Commission. Application to the Commission for review, or the 
initiation of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not 
operate as a stay of such penalty unless the Commission otherwise orders 
upon its own motion or upon application by the user, owner or operator 
that is the subject of such penalty. In any proceeding to review a 
penalty imposed under paragraph (1), the Commission, after notice and 
opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the record 
before the ERO and opportunity for the presentation of supporting 
reasons to affirm, modify, or set aside the penalty), shall by order 
affirm, set aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty, and, if 
appropriate, remand to the ERO for further proceedings. The Commission 
shall implement expedited procedures for such hearings.
    ``(3) On its own motion or upon complaint, the Commission may order 
compliance with a reliability standard and may impose a penalty against 
a user or owner or operator of the bulk-power system if the Commission 
finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the user or 
owner or operator of the bulk-power system has engaged or is about to 
engage in any acts or practices that constitute or will constitute a 
violation of a reliability standard.
    ``(4) <<NOTE: Regulations. Contracts.>> The Commission shall issue 
regulations authorizing the ERO to enter into an agreement to delegate 
authority to a regional entity for the purpose of proposing reliability 
standards to the ERO and enforcing reliability standards under paragraph 
(1) if--
            ``(A) the regional entity is governed by--
                    ``(i) an independent board;
                    ``(ii) a balanced stakeholder board; or
                    ``(iii) a combination independent and balanced 
                stakeholder board.
            ``(B) the regional entity otherwise satisfies the provisions 
        of subsection (c)(1) and (2); and
            ``(C) the agreement promotes effective and efficient 
        administration of bulk-power system reliability.

The Commission may modify such delegation. The ERO and the Commission 
shall rebuttably presume that a proposal for delegation to a regional 
entity organized on an Interconnection-wide basis promotes effective and 
efficient administration of bulk-power system reliability and should be 
approved. Such regulation may provide that the Commission may assign the 
ERO's authority to enforce reliability standards under paragraph (1) 
directly to a regional entity consistent with the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    ``(5) The Commission may take such action as is necessary or 
appropriate against the ERO or a regional entity to ensure compliance 
with a reliability standard or any Commission order affecting the ERO or 
a regional entity.

[[Page 119 STAT. 945]]

    ``(6) Any penalty imposed under this section shall bear a reasonable 
relation to the seriousness of the violation and shall take into 
consideration the efforts of such user, owner, or operator to remedy the 
violation in a timely manner.
    ``(f) Changes in Electric Reliability Organization Rules.--The 
Electric Reliability Organization shall file with the Commission for 
approval any proposed rule or proposed rule change, accompanied by an 
explanation of its basis and purpose. The Commission, upon its own 
motion or complaint, may propose a change to the rules of the ERO. A 
proposed rule or proposed rule change shall take effect upon a finding 
by the Commission, after notice and opportunity for comment, that the 
change is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, 
is in the public interest, and satisfies the requirements of subsection 
(c).
    ``(g) Reliability Reports.--The ERO shall conduct periodic 
assessments of the reliability and adequacy of the bulk-power system in 
North America.
    ``(h) Coordination With Canada and Mexico.--The President is urged 
to negotiate international agreements with the governments of Canada and 
Mexico to provide for effective compliance with reliability standards 
and the effectiveness of the ERO in the United States and Canada or 
Mexico.
    ``(i) Savings Provisions.--(1) The ERO shall have authority to 
develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards for only the 
bulk-power system.
    ``(2) This section does not authorize the ERO or the Commission to 
order the construction of additional generation or transmission capacity 
or to set and enforce compliance with standards for adequacy or safety 
of electric facilities or services.
    ``(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt any 
authority of any State to take action to ensure the safety, adequacy, 
and reliability of electric service within that State, as long as such 
action is not inconsistent with any reliability standard, except that 
the State of New York may establish rules that result in greater 
reliability within that State, as long as such action does not result in 
lesser reliability outside the State than that provided by the 
reliability standards.
    ``(4) <<NOTE: Deadline. Standards.>> Within 90 days of the 
application of the Electric Reliability Organization or other affected 
party, and after notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission 
shall issue a final order determining whether a State action is 
inconsistent with a reliability standard, taking into consideration any 
recommendation of the ERO.

    ``(5) The Commission, after consultation with the ERO and the State 
taking action, may stay the effectiveness of any State action, pending 
the Commission's issuance of a final order.
    ``(j) <<NOTE: Establishment.>> Regional Advisory Bodies.--The 
Commission shall establish a regional advisory body on the petition of 
at least two-thirds of the States within a region that have more than 
one-half of their electric load served within the region. A regional 
advisory body shall be composed of one member from each participating 
State in the region, appointed by the Governor of each State, and may 
include representatives of agencies, States, and provinces outside the 
United States. A regional advisory body may provide advice to the 
Electric Reliability Organization, a regional entity, or the Commission 
regarding the governance of an existing or proposed regional entity 
within the same region, whether a standard

[[Page 119 STAT. 946]]

proposed to apply within the region is just, reasonable, not unduly 
discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest, whether fees 
proposed to be assessed within the region are just, reasonable, not 
unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest and 
any other responsibilities requested by the Commission. The Commission 
may give deference to the advice of any such regional advisory body if 
that body is organized on an Interconnection-wide basis.

    ``(k) Alaska and Hawaii.--The provisions of this section do not 
apply to Alaska or Hawaii.''.
    (b) <<NOTE: 16 USC 824o note.>> Status of ERO.--The Electric 
Reliability Organization certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission under section 215(c) of the Federal Power Act and any 
regional entity delegated enforcement authority pursuant to section 
215(e)(4) of that Act are not departments, agencies, or 
instrumentalities of the United States Government.

    (c) <<NOTE: 16 USC 824o note.>> Access Approvals by Federal 
Agencies.--Federal agencies responsible for approving access to electric 
transmission or distribution facilities located on lands within the 
United States shall, in accordance with applicable law, expedite any 
Federal agency approvals that are necessary to allow the owners or 
operators of such facilities to comply with any reliability standard, 
approved by the Commission under section 215 of the Federal Power Act, 
that pertains to vegetation management, electric service restoration, or 
resolution of situations that imminently endanger the reliability or 
safety of the facilities.

section, the term `unregulated transmitting utility' means an entity 
that--
            ``(1) owns or operates facilities used for the transmission 
        of electric energy in interstate commerce; and
            ``(2) is an entity described in section 201(f).

    ``(b) Transmission Operation Services.--Subject to section 212(h), 
the Commission may, by rule or order, require an unregulated 
transmitting utility to provide transmission services--
            ``(1) at rates that are comparable to those that the 
        unregulated transmitting utility charges itself; and
            ``(2) on terms and conditions (not relating to rates) that 
        are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting 
        utility provides transmission services to itself and that are 
        not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

    ``(c) Exemption.--The Commission shall exempt from any rule or order 
under this section any unregulated transmitting utility that--
            ``(1) sells not more than 4,000,000 megawatt hours of 
        electricity per year;
            ``(2) does not own or operate any transmission facilities 
        that are necessary for operating an interconnected transmission

        cooperatives, provides electric service to end-users.
            ``(2) The term `load-serving entity' means a distribution 
        utility or an electric utility that has a service obligation.

[[Page 119 STAT. 958]]

            ``(3) The term `service obligation' means a requirement 
        applicable to, or the exercise of authority granted to, an 
        electric utility under Federal, State, or local law or under 
        long-term contracts to provide electric service to end-users or 
        to a distribution utility.
            ``(4) The term `State utility' means a State or any 
        political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority, or 
        instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or a 
        corporation that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any 
        one or more of the foregoing, competent to carry on the business 
        of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power.

    ``(b) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> Meeting Service Obligations.--(1) 
Paragraph (2) applies to any load-serving entity that, as of the date of 
enactment of this section--
            ``(A) owns generation facilities, markets the output of 
        Federal generation facilities, or holds rights under one or more 
        wholesale contracts to purchase electric energy, for the purpose 
        of meeting a service obligation; and
            ``(B) by reason of ownership of transmission facilities, or 
        one or more contracts or service agreements for firm 
        transmission service, holds firm transmission rights for 
        delivery of the output of the generation facilities or the 
        purchased energy to meet the service obligation.

    ``(2) Any load-serving entity described in paragraph (1) is entitled 
to use the firm transmission rights, or, equivalent tradable or 
financial transmission rights, in order to deliver the output or 
purchased energy, or the output of other generating facilities or 
purchased energy to the extent deliverable using the rights, to the 
extent required to meet the service obligation of the load-serving 
entity.
    ``(3)(A) To the extent that all or a portion of the service 
obligation covered by the firm transmission rights or equivalent 
tradable or financial transmission rights is transferred to another 
load-serving entity, the successor load-serving entity shall be entitled 
to use the firm transmission rights or equivalent tradable or financial 
transmission rights associated with the transferred service obligation.
    ``(B) Subsequent transfers to another load-serving entity, or back 
to the original load-serving entity, shall be entitled to the same 
rights.
    ``(4) The Commission shall exercise the authority of the Commission 
under this Act in a manner that facilitates the planning and expansion 
of transmission facilities to meet the reasonable needs of load-serving 
entities to satisfy the service obligations of the load-serving 
entities, and enables load-serving entities to secure firm transmission 
rights (or equivalent tradable or financial rights) on a long-term basis 
for long-term power supply arrangements made, or planned, to meet such 
needs.
    ``(c) Allocation of Transmission Rights.--Nothing in subsections 
(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section shall affect any existing or 
future methodology employed by a Transmission Organization for 
allocating or auctioning transmission rights if such Transmission 
Organization was authorized by the Commission to allocate or auction 
financial transmission rights on its system as of January 1, 2005, and 
the Commission determines that any future allocation or auction is just, 
reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, provided, 
however, that if such a Transmission

Organization never allocated financial transmission rights on its system 
that pertained to a period before January 1, 2005, with respect to any 
application by such Transmission Organization that would change its 
methodology the Commission shall exercise its authority in a manner 
consistent with the Act and that takes into account the policies 
expressed in subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) as applied to firm 
transmission rights held by a load-serving entity as of January 1, 2005, 
to the extent the associated generation ownership or power purchase 
arrangements remain in effect.
    ``(d) Certain Transmission Rights.--The Commission may exercise 
authority under this Act to make transmission rights not used to meet an 
obligation covered by subsection (b) available to other entities in a 
manner determined by the Commission to be just, reasonable, and not 
unduly discriminatory or preferential.
    ``(e) Obligation to Build.--Nothing in this Act relieves a load-
serving entity from any obligation under State or local law to build 
transmission or distribution facilities adequate to meet the service 
obligations of the load-serving entity.
    ``(f) Contracts.--Nothing in this section shall provide a basis for 
abrogating any contract or service agreement for firm transmission 
service or rights in effect as of the date of the enactment of this 
subsection. If an ISO in the Western Interconnection had allocated 
financial transmission rights prior to the date of enactment of this 
section but had not done so with respect to one or more load-serving 
entities' firm transmission rights held under contracts to which the 
preceding sentence applies (or held by reason of ownership or future 
ownership of transmission facilities), such load-serving entities may 
not be required, without their consent, to convert such firm 
transmission rights to tradable or financial rights, except where the 
load-serving entity has voluntarily joined the ISO as a participating 
transmission owner (or its successor) in accordance with the ISO tariff.
    ``(g) Water Pumping Facilities.--The Commission shall ensure that 
any entity described in section 201(f) that owns transmission facilities 
used predominately to support its own water pumping facilities shall 
have, with respect to the facilities, protections for transmission 
service comparable to those provided to load-serving entities pursuant 
to this section.
    ``(h) ERCOT.--This section shall not apply within the area referred 
to in section 212(k)(2)(A).

to take any action not otherwise within the jurisdiction of the 
Commission.

of subsection (b)(1)(B), a load-serving entity that is located within 
the service area of the Tennessee Valley Authority and that has a firm 
wholesale power supply contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority 
shall be considered to hold firm transmission rights for the 
transmission of the power provided.

        improve the ability of nonutility generation resources to offer 
        their output for sale for the purpose of inclusion in economic 
        dispatch; and
            (3) the potential benefits to residential, commercial, and 
        industrial electricity consumers nationally and in each State if 
        economic dispatch procedures were revised to improve the ability 
        of nonutility generation resources to offer their output for 
        inclusion in economic dispatch.

    (b) Definition.--The term ``economic dispatch'' when used in this 
section means the operation of generation facilities to produce energy 
at the lowest cost to reliably serve consumers, recognizing any 
operational limits of generation and transmission facilities.

            MECHANISM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in regard to a proposal to develop and implement a 
        specific type of locational installed capacity mechanism in New 
        England pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; 
        and
            (2) the Governors of the States have objected to the 
        proposed mechanism, arguing that the mechanism--
                    (A) would not provide adequate assurance that 
                necessary electric generation capacity or reliability 
                will be provided; and
                    (B) would impose a high cost on consumers and have a 
                significant negative economic impact.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) notes the concerns of the New England States to the 
        proposed mechanism; and
            (2) declares that it is the sense of Congress that the 
        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should carefully consider 
        the States' objections.

section. The rules shall provide for the dissemination, on a timely

SEC. 1502. <<NOTE: 42 USC 7545 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (hereinafter in 
        this section referred to as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide 
        at low levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster 
        or anti-knocking agent;
            (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air 
        Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) established a 
        fuel oxygenate standard under which reformulated gasoline must 
        contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight; and
            (3) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate 
        standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making substantial 
        investments in--
                    (A) MTBE production capacity; and
                    (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to 
                the marketplace.

        applicant under reasonable terms or conditions sufficient to 
        finance the construction of a facility described in subsection 
        (b);
            (2) the prospective earning power of the applicant and the 
        character and value of the security pledged provide a reasonable 
        assurance of repayment of the loan to be guaranteed in 
        accordance with the terms of the loan; and
            (3) the loan bears interest at a rate determined by the 
        Secretary to be reasonable, taking into account the current 
        average yield on outstanding obligations of the United States 
        with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the maturity of 
        the loan.

    (d) Criteria.--In selecting recipients of loan guarantees from among 
applicants, the Secretary shall give preference to proposals that--
            (1) meet all applicable Federal and State permitting 
        requirements;
            (2) are most likely to be successful; and
            (3) are located in local markets that have the greatest need 
        for the facility because of--
                    (A) the limited availability of land for waste 
                disposal;
                    (B) the availability of sufficient quantities of 
                cellulosic biomass; or
                    (C) a high level of demand for fuel ethanol or other

    (e) Maturity.--A loan guaranteed under subsection (b) shall have a 
maturity of not more than 20 years.
    (f) Terms and Conditions.--The loan agreement for a loan guaranteed 
under subsection (b) shall provide that no provision of the loan 
agreement may be amended or waived without the consent of the Secretary.
    (g) Assurance of Repayment.--The Secretary shall require that an 
applicant for a loan guarantee under subsection (b) provide an assurance 
of repayment in the form of a performance bond, insurance, collateral, 
or other means acceptable to the Secretary in an amount equal to not 
less than 20 percent of the amount of the loan.
    (h) Guarantee Fee.--The recipient of a loan guarantee under 
subsection (b) shall pay the Secretary an amount determined by the 
Secretary to be sufficient to cover the administrative costs of the 
Secretary relating to the loan guarantee.

[[Page 119 STAT. 1086]]

    (i) Full Faith and Credit.--The full faith and credit of the United 
States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this 
section. Any such guarantee made by the Secretary shall be conclusive 
evidence of the eligibility of the loan for the guarantee with respect 
to principal and interest. The validity of the guarantee shall be 
incontestable in the hands of a holder of the guaranteed loan.
    (j) Reports.--Until each guaranteed loan under this section has been 
repaid in full, the Secretary shall annually submit to Congress a report 
on the activities of the Secretary under this section.
    (k) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section.
    (l) Termination of Authority.--The authority of the Secretary to 
issue a loan guarantee under subsection (b) terminates on the date that 
is 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal 
Government (1) having jurisdiction over any underground storage tank or 
underground storage tank system, or (2) engaged in any activity 
resulting, or which may result, in the installation, operation, 
management, or closure of any underground storage tank, release response 
activities related thereto, or in the delivery, acceptance, or deposit 
of any regulated substance to an underground storage tank or underground 
storage tank system shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, 
State, interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and 
procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any 
provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by 
a court to enforce such relief), respecting underground storage tanks in 
the same manner, and to the same extent, as any person is subject to 
such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service charges. 
The Federal, State, interstate, and local substantive and procedural 
requirements referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited 
to, all administrative orders and all civil and administrative penalties 
and fines, regardless of whether such penalties or fines are punitive or 
coercive in nature or are imposed for isolated, intermittent, or 
continuing violations. The United States hereby expressly waives any 
immunity otherwise applicable to the United States with respect to any 
such substantive or procedural requirement (including, but not limited 
to, any injunctive relief, administrative order or civil or 
administrative penalty or fine referred to in the preceding sentence, or 
reasonable service charge). The reasonable service charges referred to 
in this subsection include, but are not limited to, fees or charges 
assessed in connection with the processing and issuance of permits, 
renewal of permits, amendments to permits, review of plans, studies, and 
other documents, and inspection and monitoring of facilities, as well as 
any other nondiscriminatory charges that are assessed in connection with 
a Federal, State, interstate, or local underground storage tank 
regulatory program. Neither the United States, nor any agent, employee, 
or officer thereof, shall be immune or exempt from any process or 
sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement 
of any such injunctive relief. No agent, employee, or officer of the 
United States shall be personally liable for any civil penalty under any 
Federal, State, interstate, or local law concerning underground storage 
tanks with respect to any act or omission within the scope of the 
official duties of the agent, employee, or officer. An agent, employee, 
or officer of the United States shall be subject to any criminal 
sanction (including, but not limited to, any fine or imprisonment) under 
any Federal or State law concerning underground storage tanks, but no 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or 
judicial branch of the Federal Government shall be subject to any

such sanction. The President may exempt any underground storage tank of 
any department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch from 
compliance with such a requirement if he determines it to be in the 
paramount interest of the United States to do so. No such exemption 
shall be granted due to lack of appropriation unless the President shall 
have specifically requested such appropriation as a part of the 
budgetary process and the Congress shall have failed to make available 
such requested appropriation. Any exemption shall be for a period not in 
excess of 1 year, but additional exemptions may be granted for periods 
not to exceed 1 year upon the President's making a new 
determination. <<NOTE: President. Reports.>> The President shall report 
each January to the Congress all exemptions from the requirements of 
this section granted during the preceding calendar year, together with 
his reason for granting each such exemption.

    (b) Limit on Number of Boutique Fuels.--Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)), as amended by subsection (a), 
is further amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(v)(I) The Administrator shall have no authority, when considering 
a State implementation plan or a State implementation plan revision, to 
approve under this paragraph any fuel included in such plan or revision 
if the effect of such approval increases the total number of fuels 
approved under this paragraph as of September 1, 2004, in all State 
implementation plans.
    ``(II) <<NOTE: Deadline. Federal Register, publication. Public 
information.>> The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Energy, shall determine the total number of fuels approved under this 
paragraph as of September 1, 2004, in all State implementation plans and 
shall publish a list of such fuels, including the States and Petroleum 
Administration for Defense District in which they are used, in the 
Federal Register for public review and comment no later than 90 days 
after enactment.

    ``(III) The Administrator shall remove a fuel from the list 
published under subclause (II) if a fuel ceases to be included in a 
State implementation plan or if a fuel in a State implementation plan is 
identical to a Federal fuel formulation implemented by the 
Administrator, but the Administrator shall not reduce the total number 
of fuels authorized under the list published under subclause (II).
    ``(IV) Subclause (I) shall not limit the Administrator's authority 
to approve a control or prohibition respecting any new fuel under this 
paragraph in a State implementation plan or revision to a State 
implementation plan if such new fuel--
            ``(aa) completely replaces a fuel on the list published 
        under subclause (II); or
            ``(bb) does not increase the total number of fuels on the 
        list published under subclause (II) as of September 1, 2004.

In the <<NOTE: Supply. Federal Register, publication.>> event that the 
total number of fuels on the list published under subclause (II) at the 
time of the Administrator's consideration of a control or prohibition 
respecting a new fuel is lower than the total number of fuels on such 
list as of September 1, 2004, the Administrator may approve a control or 
prohibition respecting a new fuel under this subclause if the 
Administrator, after consultation with the Secretary of Energy, 
publishes in the Federal Register after notice and comment a finding 
that, in the Administrator's judgment, such control or prohibition 
respecting a new fuel will not cause fuel supply or distribution 
interruptions or have a significant adverse impact on fuel producibility 
in the affected area or contiguous areas.

    ``(V) The Administrator shall have no authority under this 
paragraph, when considering any particular State's implementation

plan or a revision to that State's implementation plan, to approve any 
fuel unless that fuel was, as of the date of such consideration, 
approved in at least one State implementation plan in the applicable 
Petroleum Administration for Defense District. However, the 
Administrator may approve as part of a State implementation plan or 
State implementation plan revision a fuel with a summertime Reid Vapor 
Pressure of 7.0 psi. In no event shall such approval by the 
Administrator cause an increase in the total number of fuels on the list 
published under subclause (II).
    ``(VI) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to have any effect 
regarding any available authority of States to require the use of any 
fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b), including 
any fuel additive registered in accordance with subsection (b) after the 
enactment of this subclause.''.
