    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled, <<NOTE: North Korea

SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 50 USC 1701 note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``North Korea Nonproliferation Act of 
2006''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) In view of --
            (1) North Korea's manifest determination to produce 
        missiles, nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction 
        and to proliferate missiles, in violation of international norms 
        and expectations; and
            (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695, adopted 
        on July 15, 2006, which requires all Member States, in 
        accordance with their national legal authorities and consistent 
        with international law, to exercise vigilance and prevent--
                    (A) missile and missile-related items, materials, 
                goods, and technology from being transferred to North 
                Korea's missile or weapons of mass destruction programs; 
                and
                    (B) the procurement of missiles or missile-related 
                items, materials, goods, and technology from North 
                Korea, and the transfer of any financial resources in 
                relation to North Korea's missile or weapons of mass 
                destruction programs,
        it should be the policy of the United States to impose sanctions 
        on persons who transfer such weapons, and goods and technology 
        related to such weapons, to and from North Korea in the same 
        manner as persons who transfer such items to and from Iran and 
        Syria currently are sanctioned under United States law.
