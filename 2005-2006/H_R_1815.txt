                expected maintenance costs exceed annual appropriations.
                    (F) Operational and financial flexibility and

SEC. 324. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEPOT MAINTENANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan of the 
        Air Force reflects the essential requirements for the Air Force 
        to maintain a ready and controlled source of organic technical 
        competence, thereby ensuring an effective and timely response to 
        national defense contingencies and emergency requirements.
            (2) Since the publication of the Depot Maintenance Strategy 
        and Master Plan of the Air Force in 2002, the Air Force has made 
        great progress toward modernizing all three of its depots, in 
        order to maintain the status of those depots as ``world class'' 
        maintenance repair and overhaul operations.
            (3) One of the central components of the Depot Maintenance 
        Strategy and Master Plan of the Air Force is the commitment of 
        the Air Force to allocate $150,000,000 each fiscal year for six 
        years, beginning in fiscal year 2004, for recapitalization and 
        investment, including the procurement of technologically 
        advanced facilities and equipment, of the Nation's three Air 
        Force depots.
            (4) The funds expended to date have ensured that 
        transformation projects, such as the initial implementation of 
        ``Lean'' and ``Six Sigma'' production techniques, have achieved 
        great success in reducing the time necessary to perform depot 
        maintenance on aircraft.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Air Force should be commended for the implementation 
        of its Depot Maintenance Strategy and Master Plan and, in 
        particular, meeting the capital investment strategy pursuant to 
        the Plan; and
            (2) the Air Force should remain committed to the depot 
        maintenance process improvement initiatives and the investments 
        and recapitalization projects pursuant to the Depot Maintenance 
        Strategy and Master Plan.

            (3) Whether there are certain benefits, including cost 
        benefits, to having the Army and Air Force Exchange Service

SEC. 381. DEFINITIONS.

    In this subtitle:
            (1) The term ``covered wilderness'' means the wilderness 
        area designated by this subtitle and wilderness study areas 
        located near lands withdrawn for military use and beneath 
        special use airspace critical to the support of military test 
        and training missions at the Utah Test and Training Range, 
        including the Deep Creek, Fish Springs, Swasey Mountain, Howell 
        Peak, Notch Peak, King Top, Wah Wah Mountain, and Conger 
        Mountain units designated by the Department of the Interior.
            (2) The term ``Utah Test and Training Range'' means those 
        portions of the military operating area of the Utah Test and

SEC. 382. MILITARY OPERATIONS AND OVERFLIGHTS, UTAH TEST AND TRAINING 
            RANGE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The testing and development of military weapons systems 
        and the training of military forces are critical to ensuring the 
        national security of the United States.
            (2) The Utah Test and Training Range in the State of Utah is 
        a unique and irreplaceable national asset at the core of the 
        test and training mission of the Department of Defense.
            (3) The Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area designated by section 
        384, as well as several wilderness study areas, are located near 
        lands withdrawn for military use or are beneath special use 
        airspace critical to the support of military test and training 
        missions at the Utah Test and Training Range.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3216]]

            (4) The Utah Test and Training Range and special use 
        airspace withdrawn for military uses create unique management 
        circumstances for the covered wilderness in this subtitle, and 
        it is not the intent of Congress that passage of this subtitle 
        shall be construed as establishing a precedent with respect to 
        any future national conservation area or wilderness designation.
            (5) Continued access to the special use airspace and lands 
        that comprise the Utah Test and Training Range, under the terms 
        and conditions described in this subtitle, is a national 
        security priority and is not incompatible with the protection 
        and proper management of the natural, environmental, cultural, 
        and other resources of such lands.

    (b) Overflights.--Nothing in this subtitle or the Wilderness Act 
shall preclude low-level overflights and operations of military 
aircraft, helicopters, missiles, or unmanned aerial vehicles over the 
covered wilderness, including military overflights and operations that 
can be seen or heard within the covered wilderness.
    (c) Special Use Airspace and Training Routes.--Nothing in this 
subtitle or the Wilderness Act shall preclude the designation of new 
units of special use airspace, the expansion of existing units of 
special use airspace, or the use or establishment of military training 
routes over the covered wilderness.
    (d) Communications and Tracking Systems.--Nothing in this subtitle 
shall prevent any required maintenance of existing communications, 
instrumentation, or electronic tracking systems (or infrastructure 
supporting such systems) or prevent the installation of new 
communication, instrumentation, or other equipment necessary for 
effective testing and training to meet military requirements in 
wilderness study areas located beneath special use airspace comprising 
the Utah Test and Training Range, including the Deep Creek, Fish 
Springs, Swasey Mountain, Howell Peak, Notch Peak, King Top, Wah Wah 
Mountain, and Conger Mountain units designated by the Department of 
Interior, so long as the Secretary of the Interior, after consultation 
with the Secretary of the Air Force, determines that the installation 
and maintenance of such systems, when considered both individually and 
collectively, comply with section 603 of the Federal Land Policy and 
Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782).
    (e) Emergency Access and Response.--Nothing in this subtitle or the 
Wilderness Act shall preclude the continuation of the memorandum of 
understanding in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act 
between the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Air 
Force with respect to emergency access and response.
    (f) Prohibition on Ground Military Operations.--Except as provided 
in subsections (d) and (e), nothing in this section shall be construed 
to permit a military operation to be conducted on the ground in covered 
wilderness in the Utah Test and Training Range unless such ground 
operation is otherwise permissible under Federal law and consistent with 
the Wilderness Act.

dated March 7, 2004, are hereby designated as wilderness and, therefore, 
as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System to be 
known as the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area.
    (b) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands 
in the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area are hereby withdrawn from all 
forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, 
from location, entry, and patent under the United States mining laws, 
and from disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal 
leasing, and mineral materials, and all amendments to such laws.
    (c) Map and Description.--
            (1) Transmittal.--As soon as practicable after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall

        Wilderness Area to the Committee on Resources of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate.
            (2) Legal effect.--The map and legal description shall have 
        the same force and effect as if included in this Act, except 
        that the Secretary of the Interior may correct clerical and 
        typographical errors in the map and legal description.
            (3) Availability.--The map and legal description shall be on 
        file and available for public inspection in the office of the

        Utah.

    (d) Administration.--Subject to valid existing rights and this 
subtitle, the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area shall be administered by 
the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the provisions of the 
Wilderness Act, except that any reference in such provisions to the 
effective date of the Wilderness Act (or any similar reference) shall be 
deemed to be a reference to the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (e) Land Acquisition.--Any lands or interest in lands within the 
boundaries of the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area acquired by the United 
States after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be added to and 
administered as part of the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area.
    (f) Fish and Wildlife Management.--As provided in section 4(d)(7) of 
the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(7)), nothing in this subtitle

with respect to fish and wildlife on the Federal lands located in that 
State.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3218]]

    (g) Grazing.--Within the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area, the grazing 
of livestock, where established before the date of the enactment of this 
Act, shall be permitted to continue subject to such reasonable 
regulations, policies, and practices as the Secretary of the Interior 
considers necessary, as long as such regulations, policies, and 
practices fully conform with and implement the intent of Congress 
regarding grazing in such areas, as such intent is expressed in the 
Wilderness Act, section 101(f) of Public Law 101-628 (104 Stat. 4473), 
and appendix A of the Report of the Committee on Interior and Insular 
Affairs to accompany H.R. 2570 of the 101st Congress (H. Rept. 101-405).
    (h) Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend for the designation of 
the Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area to lead to the creation of protective 
perimeters or buffer zones around the wilderness area. The fact that 
nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard within the 
wilderness area shall not, of itself, preclude such activities or uses 
up to the boundary of the wilderness area.
    (i) Release From Wilderness Study Area Status.--The lands identified 
as the Browns Spring Cherrystem on the map entitled ``Proposed Browns 
Spring Cherrystem'' and dated May 11, 2004, are released from their

requirements of section 603(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782(c)) pertaining to the management of 
wilderness study areas in a manner that does not impair the suitability

is an element of the offense in subsection (m) (wrongful sexual

an affirmative defense, in a prosecution under any other subsection, 
except they are an affirmative defense for the sexual conduct in issue 
in a prosecution under subsection (a) (rape), subsection (c) (aggravated 
sexual assault), subsection (e) (aggravated sexual contact), and 
subsection (h) (abusive sexual contact).

        child's consent is not relevant.
            ``(12) Indecent conduct.--The term `indecent conduct' means 
        that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is 
        grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and 
        tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with respect to 
        sexual relations. Indecent conduct includes observing, or making 
        a videotape, photograph, motion picture, print, negative, slide, 
        or other mechanically, electronically, or chemically reproduced 
        visual material, without another person's consent, and contrary 
        to that other person's reasonable expectation of privacy, of--
                    ``(A) that other person's genitalia, anus, or 
                buttocks, or (if that other person is female) that 
                person's areola or nipple; or
                    ``(B) that other person while that other person is 
                engaged in a sexual act, sodomy (under section 925 
                (article 125)), or sexual contact.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3262]]

            ``(13) Act of prostitution.--The term `act of prostitution' 
        means a sexual act, sexual contact, or lewd act for the purpose 
        of receiving money or other compensation.
            ``(14) Consent.--The term `consent' means words or overt 
        acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct 
        at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent 
        through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of 
        verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the 
        accused's use of force, threat of force, or placing another 
        person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or 
        previous dating relationship by itself or the manner of dress of 
        the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at 
        issue shall not constitute consent. A person cannot consent to 
        sexual activity if--
                    ``(A) under 16 years of age; or
                    ``(B) substantially incapable of--
                          ``(i) appraising the nature of the sexual 
                      conduct at issue due to--
                                    ``(I) mental impairment or 
                                unconsciousness resulting from 
                                consumption of alcohol, drugs, a similar 
                                substance, or otherwise; or
                                    ``(II) mental disease or defect 
                                which renders the person unable to 
                                understand the nature of the sexual 
                                conduct at issue;
                          ``(ii) physically declining participation in 
                      the sexual conduct at issue; or
                          ``(iii) physically communicating unwillingness 
                      to engage in the sexual conduct at issue.
            ``(15) Mistake of fact as to consent.--The term `mistake of 
        fact as to consent' means the accused held, as a result of 
        ignorance or mistake, an incorrect belief that the other person 
        engaging in the sexual conduct consented. The ignorance or 
        mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and must 
        have been reasonable under all the circumstances. To be 
        reasonable the ignorance or mistake must have been based on 
        information, or lack of it, which would indicate to a reasonable 
        person that the other person consented. Additionally, the 
        ignorance or mistake cannot be based on the negligent failure to 
        discover the true facts. Negligence is the absence of due care. 
        Due care is what a reasonably careful person would do under the 
        same or similar circumstances. The accused's state of 
        intoxication, if any, at the time of the offense is not relevant 
        to mistake of fact. A mistaken belief that the other person 
        consented must be that which a reasonably careful, ordinary, 
        prudent, sober adult would have had under the circumstances at 
        the time of the offense.
            ``(16) Affirmative defense.--The term `affirmative defense' 
        means any special defense which, although not denying that the 
        accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense 
        charged, denies, wholly, or partially, criminal responsibility 
        for those acts. The accused has the burden of proving the 
        affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence. After the 
        defense meets this burden, the prosecution shall have the burden 
        of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmative 
        defense did not exist.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The item relating to section 920 
        (article 120) in the table of sections at the beginning

SEC. 915. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NATIONAL SECURITY ASPECT OF UNITED 
            STATES PREEMINENCE IN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that the following:
            (1) Preeminence by the United States in human spaceflight 
        allows the United States to project leadership around the world 
        and forms an important component of United States national 
        security.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3410]]

            (2) Continued development of human spaceflight in low-Earth 
        orbit, on the Moon, and beyond adds to the overall national 
        strategic posture.
            (3) Human spaceflight enables continued stewardship of the 
        region between the Earth and the Moon--an area that is critical 
        and of growing national and international security relevance.
            (4) Human spaceflight provides unprecedented opportunities 
        for the United States to lead peaceful and productive 
        international relationships with the world community in support 
        of United States security and geo-political objectives.
            (5) An increasing number of nations are pursuing human 
        spaceflight and space-related capabilities, including China and 
        India.
            (6) Past investments in human spaceflight capabilities 
        represent a national resource that can be built upon and 
        leveraged for a broad range of purposes, including national and 
        economic security.
            (7) The industrial base and capabilities represented by the 
        Space Transportation System (popularly referred to as the 
        ``space shuttle'') provide a critical launch capability for the 
        Nation.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it is in 
the national security interest of the United States to maintain 
preeminence in human spaceflight.

                Subtitle D--Intelligence-Related Matters

SEC. 931. <<NOTE: 50 USC 403-5 note.>> DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STRATEGY 
            FOR OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is 
        produced from publicly available information and is collected, 
        exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate 
        audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence 
        requirement.
            (2) With the Information Revolution, the amount, 
        significance, and accessibility of open-source information has 
        expanded significantly, but the intelligence community has not 
        expanded its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open-
        source intelligence.
            (3) The production of open-source intelligence is a valuable 
        intelligence discipline that must be integrated into 
        intelligence tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and 
        dissemination to ensure that United States policymakers are 
        fully and completely informed.
            (4) The dissemination and use of validated open-source 
        intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open-
        source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive 
        sources and methods. Open-source intelligence products can

[[Page 119 STAT. 3412]]

        be shared with the American public and foreign allies because of 
        the unclassified nature of open-source intelligence.
            (5) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the 
        United States (popularly referred to as the ``9/11 
        Commission''), in its final report released on July 22, 2004, 
        identified shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use 
        all-source intelligence, a large component of which is open-
        source intelligence.
            (6) In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
        of 2004 (Public Law 108-458), Congress calls for coordination of 
        the collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of open-
        source intelligence.
            (7) The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the 
        United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, in its 
        report to the President released on March 31, 2005, found that 
        ``the need for exploiting open-source material is greater now 
        than ever before,'' but that ``the Intelligence Community's open 
        source programs have not expanded commensurate with either the 
        increase in available information or with the growing importance 
        of open source data to today's problems''.

    (b) Department of Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence.--
            (1) Development of strategy.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
        develop a strategy for the purpose of integrating open-source 
        intelligence into the Defense intelligence process. The strategy 
        shall be known as the ``Defense Strategy for Open-Source 
        Intelligence''. The strategy shall be incorporated within the 
        larger Defense intelligence strategy.
            (2) <<NOTE: Reports. Deadline.>> Submission.--The Secretary 
        shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the strategy 
        developed under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not 
        later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

    (c) Matters to Be Included.--The strategy under subsection (b) shall 
include the following:
            (1) A plan for providing funds over the period of the 
        future-years defense program for the development of a robust 
        open-source intelligence capability for the Department of 
        Defense, with particular emphasis on exploitation and 
        dissemination.
            (2) A description of how management of the collection of 
        open-source intelligence is currently conducted within the 
        Department of Defense and how that management can be improved.
            (3) A description of the tools, systems, centers, 
        organizational entities, and procedures to be used within the 
        Department of Defense to perform open-source intelligence 
        tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and 
        dissemination.
            (4) A description of proven tradecraft for effective 
        exploitation of open-source intelligence, to include 
        consideration of operational security.
            (5) A detailed description on how open-source intelligence 
        will be fused with all other intelligence sources across the 
        Department of Defense.
            (6) A description of--
                    (A) a training plan for Department of Defense 
                intelligence personnel with respect to open-source 
                intelligence; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 3413]]

                    (B) open-source intelligence guidance for Department 
                of Defense intelligence personnel.
            (7) A plan to incorporate the function of oversight of open-
        source intelligence--
                    (A) into the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense 
                for Intelligence; and
                    (B) into service intelligence organizations.
            (8) A plan to incorporate and identify an open-source 
        intelligence specialty into personnel systems of the Department 
        of Defense, including military personnel systems.
            (9) A plan for the use of intelligence personnel of the 
        reserve components to augment and support the open-source 
        intelligence mission.
            (10) A plan for the use of the Open-Source Information 
        System for the purpose of exploitation and dissemination of 
        open-source intelligence.

SEC. 933. <<NOTE: Classified information.>> OPERATIONAL FILES OF THE 
            DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

    (a) Protection of Operational Files of Defense Intelligence 
Agency.--
            (1) Protection of files.--Title VII of the National Security 
        Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by adding at the 
        end the following new section:


         ``operational files of the defense intelligence agency


    ``Sec. 705. <<NOTE: 50 USC 432c.>> (a) Exemption of Operational

SEC. 1023. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DRUG TRAFFICKING DETERRENCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Department of State, drug trafficking 
        organizations shipped approximately nine tons of cocaine to the 
        United States through the Dominican Republic in 2004, and are 
        increasingly using small, high-speed watercraft.
            (2) Drug traffickers use the Caribbean corridor to smuggle 
        narcotics to the United States via Puerto Rico and the Dominican 
        Republic. This route is ideal for drug trafficking because of 
        its geographic expanse, numerous law enforcement jurisdictions, 
        and fragmented investigative efforts.
            (3) The tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico, 
        contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving illicit 
        drugs into Puerto Rico. The aerostat's range and operational 
        capabilities allow it to provide surveillance coverage of the 
        eastern Caribbean corridor and the strategic waterway between 
        Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, known as the Mona 
        Passage.
            (4) Including maritime radar on the Lajas aerostat will 
        expand its ability to detect suspicious vessels in the eastern 
        Caribbean corridor.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--Given the findings contained in subsection 
(a), it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress and the Department of Defense should fund the 
        Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 3428]]

            (2) the Department of Defense should install maritime radar 
        on the Lajas, Puerto Rico, aerostat.

        that have been used in every major civil and military aircraft 
        developed over the last 50 years.
            (4) It is important for the cooperative research efforts of 
        the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the

        programs; and
            (2) an important priority for improving relations between

SEC. 1226. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA ON 
            ISSUES PERTAINING TO MISSILE DEFENSE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) cooperation between the United States and Russia with 
        regard to missile defense is in the interest of the United 
        States;
            (2) there does not exist strong enough engagement between 
        the United States and Russia with respect to missile defense 
        cooperation;
            (3) the United States should explore innovative and 
        nontraditional means of cooperation with Russia on issues 
        pertaining to missile defense; and
            (4) as part of such an effort, the Secretary of Defense 
        should consider the possibilities for United States-Russian 
        cooperation with respect to missile defense through--
                    (A) the testing of specific elements of the 
                detection and tracking equipment of the Missile Defense 
                Agency of the United States Department of Defense

            note.>> UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United States 
Policy in Iraq Act''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that, in 
order to succeed in Iraq--
            (1) members of the United States Armed Forces who are 
        serving or have served in Iraq and their families deserve the

[[Page 119 STAT. 3466]]

        utmost respect and the heartfelt gratitude of the American 
        people for their unwavering devotion to duty, service to the 
        Nation, and selfless sacrifice under the most difficult 
        circumstances; the United States Congress supports our troops 
        and supports a successful conclusion to their mission;
            (2) it is important to recognize that the Iraqi people have 
        made enormous sacrifices and that the overwhelming majority of 
        Iraqis want to live in peace and security; and that the Iraqi 
        security forces in a growing number of incidences are fighting 
        side-by-side with coalition forces, are increasing in numbers 
        and improving in military capability;
            (3) the terrorists seeking to prevent the emergence of a 
        secure, stable, peaceful, and democratic Iraq are led by 
        individuals seeking to restore dictatorship in Iraq or who want 
        to advance al Qaeda's broad vision of violently extreme Islam in 
        the Middle East;
            (4) calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant 
        transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces 
        taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, 
        thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of 
        United States forces from Iraq;
            (5) United States military forces should not stay in Iraq 
        any longer than required and the professional military judgment 
        of our senior military should be a key factor in future 
        decisions;
            (6) the Administration should tell the leaders of all groups 
        and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the 
        compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable 
        political settlement that is essential for defeating the 
        insurgency in Iraq, within the schedule they set for themselves; 
        and
            (7) the President has committed to continue to explain to 
        Congress and the American people progress toward a successful 
        completion of the mission in Iraq.

    (c) Reports to Congress on United States Policy and Military 
Operations in Iraq.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every three months thereafter until all 
United States combat brigades have redeployed from Iraq, the President 
shall submit to Congress a report on United States policy and military 
operations in Iraq. To the maximum extent practicable, the report 
required in (c) shall be unclassified, with a classified annex if 
necessary. Each report shall include to the extent practical, the 
following information:
            (1) The current military mission and the diplomatic, 
        political, economic, and military measures that are being or

        to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement 
        that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq.

        Stabilizing Iraq), and any subsequent updates to that campaign 
        plan, that must be met in order to provide for the transition of

        under paragraph (3), the following should also be addressed:
                    (A) The number of battalions of the Iraqi Armed

        operational planners.
            (3) The cost of deploying units to areas referred to in

            (4) The strategic benefit of rotational deployments through 
        countries with which the United States is developing a close or 
        new security relationship.
            (5) Whether the relative speed and complexity of conducting 
        negotiations with a particular country is a discriminator in the 
        decision to deploy forces within the country.
            (6) The appropriate and available funding mechanisms for the

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China 
        Economic and Security Review Commission states that--
                    (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack 
                adequate disclosure standards, which creates the 
                potential for United States investors to unwittingly 
                contribute to enterprises that are involved in 
                activities harmful to United States security interests;
                    (B) United States influence and vital long-term 
                interests in Asia are being challenged by China's robust 
                regional economic engagement and diplomacy;
                    (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to 
                global ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and 
                ongoing;
                    (D) China's transfers of technology and components 
                for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery 
                systems to countries of concern, including countries 
                that support acts of international terrorism, have 
                helped create a new tier of countries with the 
                capability to produce WMD and ballistic missiles;
                    (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo 
                against China that is currently under consideration in 
                the European Union would accelerate weapons 
                modernization and dramatically enhance Chinese military 
                capabilities;

[[Page 119 STAT. 3471]]

                    (F) China is developing a leading-edge military with 
                the objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring 
                United States involvement in the Taiwan Strait, and 
                China's qualitative and quantitative military 
                advancements have already resulted in a dramatic shift 
                in the cross-Strait military balance toward China; and
                    (G) China's growing energy needs are driving China 
                into bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral 
                efforts to stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in 
                some cases may involve dangerous weapons transfers.
            (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress 
        approved a law that would authorize the use of force if Taiwan 
        formally declares independence.

    (b) Sense of Congress for Comprehensive Strategy.--It is the sense 
of Congress that the President should present to Congress quickly a 
comprehensive strategy to--
            (1) address the emergence of China economically, 
        diplomatically, and militarily;
            (2) promote mutually beneficial trade relations with China; 
        and
            (3) encourage China's adherence to international norms in 
        the areas of trade, international security, and human rights.

    (c) Contents of Strategy.--The strategy referred to in subsection 
(b) should address the following:
            (1) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its 
        currency, including--
                    (A) encouraging China to continue to upwardly 
                revalue the Chinese yuan against the United States 
                dollar;
                    (B) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-
                weighted basket of currencies; and
                    (C) concurrently encouraging United States trading 
                partners with similar interests to join in these 
                efforts.
            (2) Actions to make better use of the World Trade 
        Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and applicable 
        United States trade laws to redress China's trade practices, 
        including--
                    (A) exchange rate manipulation;
                    (B) denial of trading and distribution rights;
                    (C) insufficient intellectual property rights 
                protection;
                    (D) objectionable labor standards;
                    (E) subsidization of exports; and
                    (F) forced technology transfers as a condition of 
                doing business.
            (3) The United States Trade Representative should consult 
        with United States trading partners regarding any trade dispute 
        with China.
            (4) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts to 
        identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United States 
        engagement in East Asia. The initiatives should have a regional 
        focus and complement bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific 
        Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for 
        pursuit of such initiatives.
            (5) Actions by the administration to work with China to 
        prevent proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure 
        China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail commercial export 
        by North Korea of ballistic missiles.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3472]]

            (6) Actions by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of 
        Energy to consult with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
        with the objective of upgrading the current loose experience-
        sharing arrangement whereby China engages in some limited 
        exchanges with the organization to a more structured 
        arrangement.
            (7) Actions by the administration to develop a coordinated, 
        comprehensive national policy and strategy designed to maintain 
        United States scientific and technological leadership and 
        competitiveness, in light of the rise of China and the 
        challenges of globalization.
            (8) Actions to review laws and regulations governing the 
        Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), 
        including exploring whether the definition of national security 
        should include the potential impact on national economic 
        security as a criterion to be reviewed, and whether the 
        chairmanship of CFIUS should be transferred from the Secretary 
        of the Treasury to a more appropriate executive branch agency.
            (9) Actions by the President and the Secretary of State and 
        Secretary of Defense to press strongly their counterparts in the 
        European Union and its member states to maintain and strengthen 
        the embargo on selling arms to China.
            (10) Actions by the administration to discourage foreign 
        defense contractors from selling sensitive military-use 
        technology or weapons systems to China.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3521]]

contained in title XXI, XXII, XXIII, or XXIV of this Act or in an Act 
authorizing funds for a prior fiscal year for military construction 
projects, land acquisition, and family housing projects (and 
authorizations of appropriations therefor) shall terminate and no longer 
constitute authority under section 2676, 2802, 2821, or 2822 of title

land acquisition, or family housing project if the project is located at

    If the base closure and realignment decisions of the 2005 round of 
base closures and realignments under the Defense Base Closure and 
Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 
U.S.C. 2687 note) or the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy 
would result in an increase in the number of members of the Armed Forces 
assigned to a military installation, the Secretary of Defense, during 
the development of the plans to implement the decisions or strategy with 
respect to that installation, shall consult with appropriate State and 
local entities to ensure that matters affecting the local community, 
including

[[Page 119 STAT. 3522]]

requirements for transportation, utility infrastructure, housing, 
education, and family support activities, are considered.

SEC. 2836. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSTALLATION 
            REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER OF UNITS AND PERSONNEL FROM CLOSED 
            AND REALIGNED MILITARY INSTALLATIONS TO RECEIVING LOCATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The decisions of the 2005 round of base closures and 
        realignments and the Integrated Global Presence and Basing 
        Strategy will result in the permanent change of station and 
        relocation of hundreds of thousands of members of the Armed 
        Forces and their families over the next six years.
            (2) Critical quality-of-life concerns for military families 
        related to the infrastructure and installation requirements to 
        support the restructuring of the Armed Forces include adequate 
        housing and continued access to quality education facilities and 
        child care, health care, and other services.
            (3) By ensuring that facilities and infrastructure are 
        maintained at closing installations pending the actual change of 
        station and relocation of members of the Armed Forces and their 
        families and that adequate permanent facilities and 
        infrastructure await them at the receiving installations, 
        disruptions to unit operational effectiveness will be minimized 
        and the quality of life of military families will be protected.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should seek to ensure that the permanent facilities 
and infrastructure necessary to support the mission of the Armed Forces 
and the quality-of-life needs of members of the Armed Forces and their 
families are ready for use at receiving locations before units are 
transferred to such locations as a result of the 2005 round of base 
closures and realignments and the Integrated Global Presence and Basing 
Strategy.

SEC. 2837. DEFENSE ACCESS ROAD PROGRAM AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS 
            AFFECTED BY DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS OR INTEGRATED 
            GLOBAL PRESENCE AND BASING STRATEGY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that roads 
leading onto a military installation that is significantly impacted by 
an increase in the number of members of the Armed Forces assigned to the 
installation as a result of the 2005 round of defense base closure and 
realignment under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 
(part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) or the 
Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy should be considered for 
designation as defense access roads for purposes of section 210 of title 
23, United States Code.
    (b) Study of Surface Transportation Infrastructure of Affected 
Installations.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study--
            (1) to identify each military installation, if any, that 
        will be significantly impacted by an increase in the number of 
        members of the Armed Forces assigned to the installation as a 
        result of the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment 
        under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 or 
        the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 3523]]

            (2) to determine whether the existing surface transportation 
        infrastructure at each installation identified under paragraph 
        (1) is adequate to support the increased vehicular traffic 
        associated with the increase in the number of defense personnel 
        described in that paragraph.

    (c) Report.--Not later than April 15, 2007, the Secretary shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report containing the 
results of the study conducted under subsection (b).

SEC. 2838. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REVERSIONARY INTERESTS INVOLVING REAL 
            PROPERTY AT NAVY HOMEPORTS.

    It is the sense of Congress that, in implementing the decisions made 
with respect to Navy homeports as part of the 2005 round of defense base 
closures and realignments, the Secretary of the Navy should, when 
consistent with Federal policy supporting cost-free conveyances of 
Federal surplus property suitable for use to provide a public benefit, 
release or otherwise relinquish any entitlement to receive, pursuant to 
any agreement providing for such payment, compensation from any holder 
of a reversionary interest in real property used by the United States 
for improvements made to the property.

2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-355) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``conversion, 
        rehabilitation, extension, or improvement'' and inserting ``or 
        extension''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, repair, 
                replace, or convert'' after ``maintain'';
                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``authorized 
                before the date of the enactment of this Act''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new

            DEFENSE PROPERTY ON SANTA ROSA AND OKALOOSA ISLAND, FLORIDA, 
            TO GULF ISLANDS NATIONAL SEASHORE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress <<NOTE: 16 USC 459h-6 note.>> finds the 
following:
            (1) Public Law 91-660 of the 91st Congress established the 
        Gulf Islands National Seashore in the States of Florida and 
        Mississippi.
            (2) The original boundaries of the Gulf Islands National 
        Seashore encompassed certain Federal land used by the Air Force 
        and the Navy, and the use of such land was still required by the 
        Armed Forces when the seashore was established.
            (3) Senate Report 91-1514 of the 91th Congress addressed the 
        relationship between these military lands and the Gulf Islands 
        National Seashore as follows: ``While the military use of these 
        lands is presently required, they remain virtually free of 
        adverse development and they are included in the boundaries of 
        the seashore so that they can be wholly or partially transferred 
        to the Department of the Interior when they become excess to the 
        needs of the Air Force.''.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3535]]

            (4) Although section 2(a) of Public Law 91-660 (16 U.S.C. 
        459h-1(a)) authorized the eventual transfer of Federal land 
        within the boundaries of the Gulf Islands National Seashore from 
        the Department of Defense to the Secretary of the Interior, an 
        amendment mandating the transfer of excess Department of Defense 
        land on Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Island, Florida, to the 
        Secretary of the Interior is required to ensure that the 
        purposes of the Gulf Islands National Seashore are fulfilled.

    (b) Transfer Required.--Section 7 of Public Law 91-660 (16 U.S.C. 
459h-6) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``There are''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:

    ``(b) If any of the Federal land on Santa Rosa or Okaloosa Island, 
Florida, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense is ever 
excess to the needs of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of Defense shall 
transfer the excess land to the administrative jurisdiction of the 
Secretary of the Interior, subject to the terms and conditions 
acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
Defense. The Secretary of the Interior shall administer the transferred 
land as part of the seashore in accordance with the provisions of this 
Act.''.

            (1) the planned construction of an outlying landing field in 
        North Carolina is vital to the national security interests of 
        the United States; and
            (2) the Department of Defense should work with other Federal 
        agencies to provide community impact assistance to those

SEC. 2877. <<NOTE: Australia.>> SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF 
            BAKERS CREEK MEMORIAL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 1943 and 1944, the United States Armed Forces 
        operated a rest and relaxation facility in Mackay, Queensland, 
        Australia, for troops serving in the Pacific Theater during 
        World War II.
            (2) On June 14, 1943, a Boeing B-17C was transporting 6 crew 
        members and 35 servicemen from Mackay to Port Moresby, New 
        Guinea, to return the servicemen to duty after 10 days of rest 
        and relaxation leave at an Army/Red Cross facility.
            (3) The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off at Bakers 
        Creek, Australia, killing all 6 crew members and 34 of the 35 
        servicemen being transported in what was at that point the worst 
        crash in American air transport history, and what remains the 
        worst air disaster in Australian history.
            (4) Due to wartime censorship rules related to the movement 
        of troops, the tragic crash and loss of life were not reported 
        to the Australian or United States public.
            (5) Many family members of those killed did not learn the 
        circumstances of the troops deaths until they were contacted by 
        the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation beginning in 1992.
            (6) As of May 2005, the Bakers Creek Memorial Foundation had 
        contacted 36 of the 40 families that lost loved ones in the 
        tragic crash, and was continuing efforts to locate the remaining 
        four families to inform them of the true events of the crash at 
        Bakers Creek.
            (7) The Australian people marked the tragic crash at Bakers 
        Creek with a memorial established in 1992, but no similar 
        memorial has been established in the United States.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Army may establish an appropriate marker, at a site to 
be chosen at the discretion of the Secretary, to commemorate the 40 
members of the United States Armed Forces who lost their lives in the 
air crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on June 14, 1943.
