national fish hatcheries and fisheries program offices. <<NOTE: Oct. 16, 
                         2006 -  [H.R. 5381]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: National Fish Hatchery 
System Volunteer Act of 2006.>> assembled,
SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 16 USC 760aa note.>> SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Fish Hatchery System 
Volunteer Act of 2006''.
SEC. 2. <<NOTE: 16 USC 760aa.>> FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Fish Hatchery System (in this Act referred 
        to as the ``System'')--
                    (A) consists of more than 60 hatcheries, seven fish 
                technology centers, 9 fish health centers, and other 
                fisheries program offices;
                    (B) plays an integral role in the recovery of more 
                than 50 threatened species and endangered species and 
                the restoration of over 100 native species;
                    (C) provides healthy fish populations that support 
                recreational fishing opportunities, many of which are 
                related to Federal water control structures; and
                    (D) works with over 250 partners to help mitigate 
                the impacts of aquatic habitat loss and invasive 
                species.
            (2) The System faces many challenges, including aging 
        facilities, some of which date back to the late 1800s, and 
        maintenance of intensive infrastructures such as wells, pumps, 
        valves, pipes, filters, heaters, chillers, and treatment systems 
        that must keep clean water moving 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
        year.
            (3) By encouraging volunteer programs and donations and 
        fostering non-Federal partnerships with hatchery facilities, 
        Federal funding for the hatcheries can be supplemented.
            (4) By encouraging hatchery educational programs, public 
        awareness of the resources of the System and public 
        participation in the conservation of aquatic resources can be 
        promoted.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:
            (1) To encourage the use of volunteers to assist the United 
        States Fish and Wildlife Service in the management of hatcheries 
        within the System.
            (2) To facilitate partnerships between the System and non-
        Federal entities to promote public awareness of the resources

[[Page 120 STAT. 2059]]

        of the System and public participation in the conservation of 
        those resources.
            (3) To encourage donations and other contributions by 
        individuals and organizations to the System.
