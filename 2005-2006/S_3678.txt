        shall not be a violation of the antitrust laws for a person to 
        engage in conduct in accordance with a written

[[Page 120 STAT. 2877]]

        agreement to the extent that such agreement has been granted an 
        exemption under paragraph (4), during the period for which the 
        exemption is in effect.
            (4) Action on written agreements.--
                    (A) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> In general.--The Attorney 
                General, in consultation with the Chairman, shall grant,

                modifications to an exemption request regarding a 
                written agreement submitted under paragraph (2), in a 
                written statement to the Secretary, within 15 business 
                days of the receipt of such request. An exemption 
                granted under this paragraph shall take effect 
                immediately.
                    (B) Extension.--The Attorney General may extend the

                regarding a written agreement submitted in accordance

                General, in consultation with the Chairman and the 
                Secretary, finds that the conduct that will be exempted 
                will not have any substantial anticompetitive effect 
                that is not reasonably necessary for ensuring the 
                availability of the countermeasure or product involved.
            (5) Limitation on and renewal of exemptions.--An exemption 
        granted under paragraph (4) shall be limited to covered

        modifications, as appropriate, consistent with the finding 
        described in paragraph (4)(C)), on the date that is 3 years 
        after the date on which the exemption is granted unless the 
        Attorney General in consultation with the Chairman determines 
        that the exemption should not be renewed (with modifications, as 
        appropriate) considering the factors described in paragraph (4).
            (6) Authority to obtain information.--Consideration by the 
        Attorney General for granting or renewing an exemption submitted

        enactment of this Act and biannually thereafter, the Attorney
