Public Law 109-427
109th Congress

                                 An Act


 
To direct the Joint Committee on the Library to accept the donation of a 
  bust depicting Sojourner Truth and to display the bust in a suitable 
    location in the Capitol. <<NOTE: Dec. 20, 2006 -  [H.R. 4510]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Sojourner Truth was a towering figure among the founders 
        of the movement for women's suffrage in the United States, and 
        no monument that does not include her can accurately represent 
        this important development in our Nation's history.
            (2) The statue known as the Portrait Monument, originally 
        presented to Congress in 1920 in honor of the passage of the 
        Nineteenth Amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote and 
        presently exhibited in the rotunda of the Capitol, portrays 
        several early suffragists who were Sojourner Truth's 
        contemporaries but not Sojourner Truth herself, the only African 
        American among the group.
SEC. 2. ACCEPTANCE AND DISPLAY OF BUST OF SOJOURNER TRUTH IN 
                    CAPITOL.

    (a) Acceptance of Donation of Bust.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Not later 
than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Joint 
Committee on the Library shall accept the donation of a bust depicting 
Sojourner Truth, subject to such terms and conditions as the Joint 
Committee considers appropriate.

    (b) Display.--The Joint Committee shall place the bust accepted 
under subsection (a) in a suitable permanent location in the Capitol.

    Approved December 20, 2006.
