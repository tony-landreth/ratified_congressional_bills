        opportunities, including the provision of direct access to 
        satellite-based maritime distress and safety system or similar 
        system data to State enforcement officers, while considering the 
        need to maintain or provide an appropriate level of individual 
        vessel confidentiality where practicable; and
            (6) an assessment of how the satellite-based maritime 
        distress and safety system or similar systems could be 
        developed, purchased, and distributed to regulated vessels.

        this subsection, the term ``fishing cooperative'' means a 
        fishing cooperative whether or not authorized by a fishery 
        management council or Federal agency, if a majority of the

        fishermen in New England, separated by State and vessel size, 
        and the estimated annual income expected after the imposition of 
        Framework 42.
            (3) Whether the differential days-at-sea counting imposed by 
        Framework 42 would result in a reduction in the number of small 
        vessels actively participating in the New England Fishery.
            (4) The percentage and approximate number of vessels in the 
        New England fishery, separated by State and vessel type, that 
        are incapable of fishing outside the areas designated in 
        Framework 42 for differential days-at-sea counting.
            (5) The percentage of the annual groundfish catch in the New 
        England fishery that is harvested by small vessels.
            (6) The current monetary value of groundfish permits in the 
        New England fishery and the actual impact that the potential 
        imposition of Framework 42 is having on such value.
            (7) Whether permitting days-at-sea to be leased is altering 
        the market value for groundfish permits or days-at-sea in New 
        England.
            (8) Whether there is a substantially high probability that 
        the biomass targets used as a basis for Amendment 13 remain 
        achievable.
            (9) An identification of the year in which the biomass 
        targets used as a basis for Amendment 13 were last evident or 
        achieved, and the evidence used to determine such date.
            (10) Any separate or non-fishing factors, including 
        environmental factors, that may be leading to a slower 
        rebuilding of groundfish than previously anticipated.
            (11) The potential harm to the non-fishing environment and 
        ecosystem from the reduction in fishing resulting from Framework 
        42 and the potential redevelopment of the coastal land for other 
        purposes, including potential for increases in non-point source 
        of pollution and other impacts.

            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--

                    (B) the district court that adjudicated the Tribes' 
                treaty rights to take shellfish found that the growers

                take shellfish from lands owned, leased, or otherwise 
                subject to harvest by the growers;
                    (D) the Tribes, the growers, the State of 
                Washington, and the United States Department of the 
                Interior have resolved by a settlement agreement many of 
                the disputes between and among them regarding 
                implementation of the Tribes' treaty right to take 
                shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased by the 
                growers;
                    (E) the settlement agreement does not provide for 
                resolution of any claims to take shellfish from lands 
                owned or leased by the growers that potentially may be 
                brought in the future by other Tribes;
                    (F) in the absence of congressional actions, the 
                prospect of other Tribes claims to take shellfish from 
                lands owned or leased by the growers could be pursued 
                through the courts, a process which in all likelihood 
                could consume many years and thereby promote uncertainty 
                in the State of Washington and the growers and to the 
                ultimate detriment of both the Tribes and other Tribes 
                and their members;
                    (G) in order to avoid this uncertainty, it is the 
                intent of Congress that other Tribes have the option of 
                resolving their claims, if any, to a treaty right to 
                take shellfish

[[Page 121 STAT. 3650]]

                from covered tidelands owned or leased by the growers; 
                and
                    (H) this Act represents a good faith effort on the 
                part of Congress to extend to other Tribes the same fair 
                and just option of resolving their claims to take 
                shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased by the 
                growers that the Tribes have agreed to in the settlement 
                agreement.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--

                and the United States;
                    (B) to provide other Tribes with a fair and just 
                resolution of any claims to take shellfish from covered 
                tidelands, as that term is defined in the settlement 
                agreement, that potentially could be brought in the 
                future by other Tribes; and
                    (C) to authorize the Secretary to implement the 
                terms and conditions of the settlement agreement and 
                this section.

        and incorporated into this section as if fully set forth herein.
            (2) Authorization for implementation.--The Secretary is

        settlement agreement in accordance with the settlement agreement 
        and this section.

            (1) Puget sound regional shellfish settlement trust fund.--
                    (A) There is hereby established in the Treasury of 
                the United States an account to be designated as the 
                ``Puget Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Trust 
                Fund''. The Secretary shall deposit funds in the amount 
                of $22,000,000 at such time as appropriated pursuant to 
                this section into the Fund.
                    (B) The Fund shall be maintained and invested by the 
                Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of June 
                24, 1938 (25 U.S.C. 162a) until such time as all monies 
                are transferred from the Fund.
                    (C) The Secretary shall transfer monies held in the 
                Fund to each Tribe of the Tribes in the amounts and 
                manner specified by and in accordance with the payment 
                agreement established pursuant to the settlement 
                agreement and this section.
            (2) Puget sound regional shellfish settlement special 
        holding account.--
                    (A) There is hereby established in the Treasury of 
                the United States a fund to be designated as the ``Puget 
                Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Special Holding 
                Account''. The Secretary shall deposit funds in the 
                amount of $1,500,000 into the Special Holding Account in 
                fiscal year 2011 at such time as such funds are 
                appropriated pursuant to this section.

[[Page 121 STAT. 3651]]

                    (B) The Special Holding Account shall be maintained 
                and invested by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant 
                to the Act of June 24, 1938, (25 U.S.C. 162a) until such 
                time as all monies are transferred from the Special 
                Holding Account.
                    (C) If a court of competent jurisdiction renders a 
                final decision declaring that any of the other Tribes 
                has an established treaty right to take or harvest 
                shellfish in covered tidelands, as that term is defined 
                in the settlement agreement, and such tribe opts to 
                accept a share of the Special Holding Account, rather 
                than litigate this claim against the growers, the 
                Secretary shall transfer the appropriate share of the 
                monies held in the Special Holding Account to each such 
                tribe of the other Tribes in the amounts appropriate to 
                compensate the other Tribes in the same manner and for 
                the same purposes as the Tribes who are signatory to the 
                settlement agreement. Such a transfer to a tribe shall 
                constitute full and complete satisfaction of that 
                tribe's claims to shellfish on the covered tidelands.
                    (D) The Secretary may retain such amounts of the 
                Special Holding Account as necessary to provide for 
                additional tribes that may judicially establish their 
                rights to take shellfish in the covered tidelands within 
                the term of that Account, provided that the Secretary 
                pays the remaining balance to the other Tribes prior to 
                the expiration of the term of the Special Holding 
                Account.
                    (E) The Tribes shall have no interest, possessory or 
                otherwise, in the Special Holding Account.
                    (F) Twenty years after the deposit of funds into the 
                Special Holding Account, the Secretary shall close the 
                Account and transfer the balance of any funds held in 
                the Special Holding Account at that time to the 
                Treasury. However, the Secretary may continue to 
                maintain the Special Holding Account in order to resolve 
                the claim of an other Tribe that has notified the 
                Secretary in writing within the 20-year term of that 
                Tribe's interest in resolving its claim in the manner 
                provided for in this section.
                    (G) It is the intent of Congress that the other 
                Tribes, if any, shall have the option of agreeing to 
                similar rights and responsibilities as the Tribes that 
                are signatories to the settlement agreement, if they opt 
                not to litigate against the growers.
            (3) Annual report.--Each tribe of the Tribes, or any of the 
        other Tribes accepting a settlement of its claims to shellfish 
        on covered lands pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), shall submit to 
        the Secretary an annual report that describes all expenditures 
        made with monies withdrawn from the Fund or Special Holding 
        Account during the year covered by the report.
            (4) Judicial and administrative action.--The Secretary may 
        take judicial or administrative action to ensure that any monies 
        withdrawn from the Fund or Special Holding Account are used in 
        accordance with the purposes described in the settlement 
        agreement and this section.
            (5) <<NOTE: Effective date.>> Clarification of trust 
        responsibility.--Beginning on the date that monies are 
        transferred to a tribe of the Tribes or a tribe of the other 
        Tribes pursuant to this section,

        any trust responsibility or liability of the United States with 
        respect to the expenditure or investment of the monies withdrawn 
        shall cease.

    (d) State of Washington Payment.--The Secretary shall not be 
accountable for nor incur any liability for the collection, deposit, 
management or nonpayment of the State of Washington payment of 
$11,000,000 to the Tribes pursuant to the settlement agreement.
    (e) Release of Other Tribes Claims.--
            (1) <<NOTE: Effective date.>> Right to bring actions.--As of 
        the date of enactment of this section, all right of any other 
        Tribes to bring an action to enforce or exercise its treaty 
        rights to take shellfish from public and private tidelands in 
        Washington State, including from some lands owned, leased, or 
        otherwise subject to harvest by any and all growers shall be 
        determined in accordance with the decisions of the Courts of the 
        United States in United States v. Washington, Civ. No. 9213 
        (Western District of Washington).
          (2) Certain rights governed by this section.--If a tribe 
        falling within the other Tribes category opts to resolve its 
        claims to take shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased 
        by the growers pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section, 
        that tribe's rights shall be governed by this section, as well 
        as by the decisions of the Courts in United States v. 
        Washington, Civ. No. 9213.
            (3) No breach of trust.--Notwithstanding whether the United 
        States has a duty to initiate such an action, the failure or 
        declination by the United States to initiate any action to 
        enforce any other Tribe's or other Tribes' treaty rights to take 
        shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington State, 
        including from covered tidelands owned, leased, or otherwise 
        subject to harvest by any and all growers shall not constitute a 
        breach of trust by the United States or be compensable to other

    (f) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Cause of Action.--If any payment by the 
United States is not paid in the amount or manner specified by this 
section, or is not paid within 6 months after the date specified by the

by the Tribes either individually or collectively against the United 
States for money damages for the amount authorized but not paid to the 
Tribes, and the Tribes, either individually or collectively, are 
authorized to bring an action against the United States in the United 
States Court of Federal Claims for such funds plus interest.
