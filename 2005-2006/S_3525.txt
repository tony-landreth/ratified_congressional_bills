109th Congress

                                 An Act


 
 To amend part B of title IV of the Social Security Act to reauthorize 
     the promoting safe and stable families program, and for other 
            purposes. <<NOTE: Sept. 28, 2006 -  [S. 3525]>> 

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: Child and Family 
Services Improvement Act of 2006. Inter- governmental relations. 42 USC 
1305 note. 42 USC 621 note.>> assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Child and Family Services Improvement 
Act of 2006''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) For Federal fiscal year 2004, child protective services 
        (CPS) staff nationwide reported investigating or assessing an 
        estimated 3,000,000 allegations of child maltreatment, and 
        determined that 872,000 children had been abused or neglected by 
        their parents or other caregivers.
            (2) Combined, the Child Welfare Services (CWS) and Promoting 
        Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) programs provide States about 
        $700,000,000 per year, the largest source of targeted Federal 
        funding in the child protection system for services to ensure 
        that children are not abused or neglected and, whenever 
        possible, help children remain safely with their families.
            (3) A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office 
        (GAO) reported that little research is available on the 
        effectiveness of activities supported by CWS funds--evaluations 
        of services supported by PSSF funds have generally shown little 
        or no effect.
            (4) Further, the Department of Health and Human Services 
        recently completed initial Child and Family Service Reviews 
        (CFSRs) in each State. No State was in full compliance with all 
        measures of the CFSRs. The CFSRs also revealed that States need 
        to work to prevent repeat abuse and neglect of children, improve 
        services provided to families to reduce the risk of future harm 
        (including by better monitoring the participation of families in 
        services), and strengthen upfront services provided to families 
        to prevent unnecessary family break-up and protect children who 
        remain at home.
            (5) Federal policy should encourage States to invest their 
        CWS and PSSF funds in services that promote and protect the 
        welfare of children, support strong, healthy families, and 
        reduce the reliance on out-of-home care, which will help ensure 
        all children are raised in safe, loving families.
            (6) CFSRs also found a strong correlation between frequent 
        caseworker visits with children and positive outcomes for these

[[Page 120 STAT. 1234]]

        children, such as timely achievement of permanency and other 
        indicators of child well-being.
            (7) However, a December 2005 report by the Department of 
        Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that 
        only 20 States were able to produce reports to show whether 
        caseworkers actually visited children in foster care on at least 
        a monthly basis, despite the fact that nearly all States had 
        written standards suggesting monthly visits were State policy.
            (8) A 2003 GAO report found that the average tenure for a 
        child welfare caseworker is less than 2 years and this level of 
        turnover negatively affects safety and permanency for children.
            (9) Targeting CWS and PSSF funds to ensure children in 
        foster care are visited on at least a monthly basis will promote 
        better outcomes for vulnerable children, including by preventing 
        further abuse and neglect.
            (10) According to the Office of Applied Studies of the 
        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the 
        annual number of new uses of Methamphetamine, also known as 
        ``meth,'' has increased 72 percent over the past decade. 
        According to a study conducted by the National Association of 
        Counties which surveyed 500 county law enforcement agencies in 
        45 states, 88 percent of the agencies surveyed reported 
        increases in meth related arrests starting 5 years ago.
            (11) According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and 
        Health, nearly 12,000,000 Americans have tried methamphetamine. 
        Meth making operations have been uncovered in all 50 states, but 
        the most wide-spread abuse has been concentrated in the western, 
        southwestern, and Midwestern United States.
            (12) Methamphetamine abuse is on the increase, particularly 
        among women of child-bearing age. This is having an impact on 
        child welfare systems in many States. According to a survey 
        administered by the National Association of Counties (``The 
        Impact of Meth on Children''), conducted in 300 counties in 13 
        states, meth is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. Forty 
        percent of all the child welfare officials in the survey 
        reported an increase in out-of-home placements because of meth 
        in 2005.
            (13) It is appropriate also to target PSSF funds to address 
        this issue because of the unique strain the meth epidemic puts 
        on child welfare agencies. Outcomes for children affected by 
        meth are enhanced when services provided by law enforcement, 
        child welfare and substance abuse agencies are integrated.
