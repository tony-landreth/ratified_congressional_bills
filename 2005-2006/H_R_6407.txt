    ``(a) Authority Generally.-- <<NOTE: Deadline.>> The Postal 
Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of 
enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to 
time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating 
rates and classes for market-dominant products.

    ``(b) Objectives.--Such system shall be designed to achieve the 
following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with

            ``(1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase

        transparency of the ratemaking process.
            ``(7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.

        schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective 
        under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the 
        Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, 
        between, or among classes of mail.
            ``(9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the 
        Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and 
        competitive products.

    ``(c) Factors.--In establishing or revising such system, the Postal 
Regulatory Commission shall take into account--
            ``(1) the value of the mail service actually provided each 
        class or type of mail service to both the sender and the 
        recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of 
        transportation, and priority of delivery;
            ``(2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of 
        mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs 
        attributable to each class or type of mail service through 
        reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of 
        all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to 
        such class or type;

        business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of 
        the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than 
        letters;
            ``(4) the available alternative means of sending and 
        receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;
            ``(5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into 
        the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon 
        reducing costs to the Postal Service;

        simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees 
        charged the various classes of mail for postal services;
            ``(7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage 
        increased mail volume and operational efficiency;
            ``(8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail 
        matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and 
        justification for special classifications and services of mail;
            ``(9) the importance of providing classifications with 
        extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and 
        of providing those that do not require high degrees of 
        reliability and speed of delivery;
            ``(10) the desirability of special classifications for both 
        postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the 
        policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal 
        Service and postal users, when available on public and

                      costs or increasing the overall contribution to

        efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs,

        into account the factors in subsection (c). <<NOTE: Public 
        comment.>> If the Commission determines, after notice and 
        opportunity for public comment, that the system is not achieving 
        the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the 
        factors in subsection (c), the Commission may, by regulation, 
        make such modification or adopt such alternative system for 
        regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as 
        necessary to achieve the objectives.

    ``(e) Workshare Discounts.--
            ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `workshare 
        discount' refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the 
        presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, 
        as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under 
        subsection (a).
            ``(2) Scope.--The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure 
        that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal 
        Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless--

                          ``(i) associated with a new postal service, a

        that a work share discount be reduced or eliminated if the 
        reduction or elimination of the discount would--
                    ``(A) lead to a loss of volume in the affected 
                category or subclass of mail and reduce the aggregate

                Service from the category or subclass subject to the 
                discount below what it otherwise would have been if the

        workshare discount rate, the Postal Service shall, at the time

of enactment of this section, rates and classes for market-dominant

provisions of this chapter and section 407, as such provisions were last 
in effect before the date of enactment of this section. Proceedings 
initiated to consider a request for a recommended decision filed by the

SEC. 203. PROVISIONS RELATING TO EXPERIMENTAL AND NEW PRODUCTS.

    Subchapter III of chapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:

 ``SUBCHAPTER III--PROVISIONS RELATING TO EXPERIMENTAL AND NEW PRODUCTS

``Sec. 3641. Market tests of experimental products

    ``(a) Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Postal Service may conduct market 
        tests of experimental products in accordance with this section.
            ``(2) Provisions waived.--A product shall not, while it is 
        being tested under this section, be subject to the requirements 
        of sections 3622, 3633, or 3642, or regulations promulgated 
        under those sections.

    ``(b) Conditions.--A product may not be tested under this section 
unless it satisfies each of the following:
            ``(1) Significantly different product.--The product is, from 
        the viewpoint of the mail users, significantly different from 
        all products offered by the Postal Service within the 2-year 
        period preceding the start of the test.
            ``(2) Market disruption.--The introduction or continued 
        offering of the product will not create an unfair or otherwise 
        inappropriate competitive advantage for the Postal Service or 
        any mailer, particularly in regard to small business concerns 
        (as defined under subsection (h)).
            ``(3) Correct categorization.--The Postal Service identifies 
        the product, for the purpose of a test under this section, as 
        either market-dominant or competitive, consistent with the 
        criteria under section 3642(b)(1). Costs and revenues 
        attributable to a product identified as competitive shall be 
        included in any determination under section 3633(3) (relating to 
        provisions applicable to competitive products collectively). Any 
        test that solely affects products currently classified as 
        competitive, or which provides services ancillary to only 
        competitive products, shall be presumed to be in the competitive 
        product category without regard to whether a similar ancillary 
        product exists for market-dominant products.

    ``(c) Notice.--
            ``(1) In general.-- <<NOTE: Deadline. Federal Register, 
        publication.>> At least 30 days before initiating a market test 
        under this section, the Postal Service shall file

        the provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with respect 
        to any information required to be filed under paragraph (1) to 
        the same extent and in the same manner as in the case of any 
        matter described in section 504(g)(1). Nothing in paragraph (1) 
        shall be considered to permit or require the publication of any 
        information as to which confidential treatment is accorded under 
        the preceding sentence (subject to the same exception as set 
        forth in section 504(g)(3)).

    ``(d) Duration.--
            ``(1) In general.--A market test of a product under this 
        section may be conducted over a period of not to exceed 24 
        months.
            ``(2) Extension authority.--If necessary in order to 
        determine the feasibility or desirability of a product being 
        tested under this section, the Postal Regulatory Commission may, 
        upon written application of the Postal Service (filed not later 
        than 60 days before the date as of which the testing of such 
        product would otherwise be scheduled to terminate under 
        paragraph (1)), extend the testing of such product for not to 
        exceed an additional 12 months.

    ``(e) Dollar-Amount Limitation.--
            ``(1) In general.--A product may only be tested under this 
        section if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact 
        received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed 
        $10,000,000 in any year, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection 
        (g). In carrying out the preceding sentence, the Postal 
        Regulatory Commission may limit the amount of revenues the 
        Postal Service may obtain from any particular geographic market 
        as necessary to prevent market disruption (as defined under 
        subsection (b)(2)).
            ``(2) Exemption authority.--The Postal Regulatory Commission 
        may, upon written application of the Postal Service, exempt the 
        market test from the limit in paragraph (1) if the total 
        revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the 
        Postal Service from such product do not exceed $50,000,000 in 
        any year, subject to subsection (g). In reviewing an application 
        under this paragraph, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall 
        approve such application if it determines that--
                    ``(A) the product is likely to benefit the public 
                and meet an expected demand;
                    ``(B) the product is likely to contribute to the 
                financial stability of the Postal Service; and
                    ``(C) the product is not likely to result in unfair 
                or otherwise inappropriate competition.

    ``(f) Cancellation.--If the Postal Regulatory Commission at any time 
determines that a market test under this section fails, with respect to 
any particular product, to meet 1 or more of the requirements of this 
section, it may order the cancellation of the

[[Page 120 STAT. 3209]]

test involved or take such other action as it considers appropriate. A 
determination under this subsection shall be made in accordance with 
such procedures as the Commission shall by regulation prescribe.
    ``(g) Adjustment for Inflation.--For purposes of each year following 
the year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service's first 
report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a), each 
dollar amount contained in this section shall be adjusted by the change 
in the Consumer Price Index for such year (as determined under 
regulations of the Commission).
    ``(h) Definition of a Small Business Concern.--The criteria used in 
defining small business concerns or otherwise categorizing business 
concerns as small business concerns shall, for purposes of this section, 
be established by the Postal Regulatory Commission in conformance with 
the requirements of section 3 of the Small Business Act.
    ``(i) Effective Date.--Market tests under this subchapter may be 
conducted in any year beginning with the first year in which occurs the 
deadline for the Postal Service's first report to the Postal Regulatory 
Commission under section 3652(a).

``Sec. 3642. New products and transfers of products between the market-
                        dominant and competitive categories of mail

    ``(a) In General.--Upon request of the Postal Service or users of 
the mails, or upon its own initiative, the Postal Regulatory Commission 
may change the list of market-dominant products under section 3621 and 
the list of competitive products under section 3631 by adding new 
products to the lists, removing products from the lists, or transferring 
products between the lists.
    ``(b) Criteria.--All determinations by the Postal Regulatory 
Commission under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with the 
following criteria:
            ``(1) The market-dominant category of products shall consist 
        of each product in the sale of which the Postal Service 
        exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set 
        the price of such product substantially above costs, raise 
        prices significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, 
        without risk of losing a significant level of business to other 
        firms offering similar products. The competitive category of 
        products shall consist of all other products.
            ``(2) Exclusion of products covered by postal monopoly.--A 
        product covered by the postal monopoly shall not be subject to 
        transfer under this section from the market-dominant category of 
        mail. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `product 
        covered by the postal monopoly' means any product the conveyance 
        or transmission of which is reserved to the United States under 
        section 1696 of title 18, subject to the same exception as set 
        forth in the last sentence of section 409(e)(1).
            ``(3) Additional considerations.--In making any decision 
        under this section, due regard shall be given to--
                    ``(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in 
                the private sector engaged in the delivery of the 
                product involved;
                    ``(B) the views of those who use the product 
                involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; 
                and

                small business concerns (within the meaning of section 
                3641(h)).

    ``(c) Transfers of Subclasses and Other Subordinate Units 
Allowable.--Nothing in this title shall be considered to prevent 
transfers under this section from being made by reason of the fact that 
they would involve only some (but not all) of the subclasses or other 
subordinate units of the class of mail or type of postal service 
involved (without regard to satisfaction of minimum quantity 
requirements standing alone).
    ``(d) Notification and Publication Requirements.--
            ``(1) <<NOTE: Federal Register, publication.>> Notification 
        requirement.--The Postal Service shall, whenever it requests to 
        add a product or transfer a product to a different category, 
        file with the Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the 
        Federal Register a notice setting out the basis for its 
        determination that the product satisfies the criteria under 
        subsection (b) and, in the case of a request to add a product or 
        transfer a product to the competitive category of mail, that the 
        product meets the regulations promulgated by the Postal 
        Regulatory Commission under section 3633. The provisions of 
        section 504(g) shall be available with respect to any 
        information required to be filed.
            ``(2) Publication requirement.--The Postal Regulatory 
        Commission shall, whenever it changes the list of products in 
        the market-dominant or competitive category of mail, prescribe 
        new lists of products. <<NOTE: Federal Register, 
        publication.>> The revised lists shall indicate how and when any 
        previous lists (including the lists under sections 3621 and 
        3631) are superseded, and shall be published in the Federal 
        Register.

    ``(e) Prohibition.--Except as provided in section 3641, no product 
that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or 
packages may be offered by the Postal Service unless it has been 
assigned to the market-dominant or competitive category of mail (as 
appropriate) either--
            ``(1) under this subchapter; or
            ``(2) by or under any other provision of law.''.

    ``(c) Factors.--In establishing or revising such standards, the 
Postal Service shall take into account--
            ``(1) the actual level of service that Postal Service

        the Postal Service determines appropriate.

    ``(d) Review.--The regulations promulgated pursuant to this section 
(and any revisions thereto), and any violations thereof, shall be 
subject to review upon complaint under sections 3662 and 3663.''.

SEC. 302. <<NOTE: 39 USC 3691 note.>> POSTAL SERVICE PLAN.

    (a) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> In General.--Within 6 months after the 
establishment of the service standards under section 3691 of title 39, 
United States Code, as added by this Act, the Postal Service shall, in 
consultation with the Postal Regulatory Commission, develop and submit 
to Congress a plan for meeting those standards.

    (b) Contents.--The plan under this section shall--
            (1) establish performance goals;
            (2) describe any changes to the Postal Service's processing, 
        transportation, delivery, and retail networks necessary to allow 
        the Postal Service to meet the performance goals;
            (3) describe any changes to planning and performance 
        management documents previously submitted to Congress to reflect 
        new performance goals; and
            (4) describe the long-term vision of the Postal Service for 
        rationalizing its infrastructure and workforce, and how the 
        Postal Service intends to implement that vision.

    (c) Postal Facilities.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the Postal Service has more than 400 logistics 
                facilities, separate from its post office network;
                    (B) as noted by the President's Commission on the 
                United States Postal Service, the Postal Service has 
                more facilities than it needs and the streamlining of 
                this distribution network can pave the way for the 
                potential consolidation of sorting facilities and the 
                elimination of excess costs;
                    (C) the Postal Service has always revised its 
                distribution network to meet changing conditions and is 
                best suited to address its operational needs; and
                    (D) Congress strongly encourages the Postal Service 
                to--
                          (i) expeditiously move forward in its 
                      streamlining efforts; and
                          (ii) keep unions, management associations, and 
                      local elected officials informed as an essential 
                      part of this effort and abide by any procedural 
                      requirements contained in the national bargaining 
                      agreements.
            (2) In general.--The Postal Service plan shall include a 
        description of--
                    (A) the long-term vision of the Postal Service for 
                rationalizing its infrastructure and workforce; and
                    (B) how the Postal Service intends to implement that 
                vision.

[[Page 120 STAT. 3220]]

            (3) Content of facilities plan.--The plan under this 
        subsection shall include--
                    (A) a strategy for how the Postal Service intends to 
                rationalize the postal facilities network and remove 
                excess processing capacity and space from the network, 
                including estimated timeframes, criteria, and processes 
                to be used for making changes to the facilities network, 
                and the process for engaging policy makers and the 
                public in related decisions;
                    (B) a discussion of what impact any facility changes 
                may have on the postal workforce and whether the Postal 
                Service has sufficient flexibility to make needed 
                workforce changes;
                    (C) an identification of anticipated costs, cost 
                savings, and other benefits associated with the 
                infrastructure rationalization alternatives discussed in 
                the plan; and
                    (D) procedures that the Postal Service will use to--
                          (i) provide adequate public notice to 
                      communities potentially affected by a proposed 
                      rationalization decision;
                          (ii) make available information regarding any 
                      service changes in the affected communities, any 
                      other effects on customers, any effects on postal 
                      employees, and any cost savings;
                          (iii) afford affected persons ample 
                      opportunity to provide input on the proposed 
                      decision; and
                          (iv) take such comments into account in making 
                      a final decision.
            (4) Annual reports.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the 
                end of each fiscal year, the Postal Service shall 
                prepare and submit a report to Congress on how postal 
                decisions have impacted or will impact rationalization 
                plans.

                      preceding fiscal year to improve the efficiency 
                      and effectiveness of its processing, 
                      transportation, and distribution networks while 
                      preserving the timely delivery of postal services, 
                      including overall estimated costs and cost 
                      savings;

                      any excess capacity within its processing, 
                      transportation, and distribution networks and 
                      implement savings through realignment or 
                      consolidation of facilities including overall 
                      estimated costs and cost savings;
                          (iii) an estimate of how postal decisions 
                      related to mail changes, security, automation 
                      initiatives, worksharing, information technology 
                      systems, excess capacity, consolidating and

                      regulatory obstacles that prevented or will 
                      prevent or hinder the Postal Service from taking

                by the Office in accordance with generally accepted
