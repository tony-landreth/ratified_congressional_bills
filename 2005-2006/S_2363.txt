SECTION 1. <<NOTE: 20 USC 5891b note.>> EDUCATIONAL FLEXIBILITY PROGRAM 
            EXTENSION.

    (a) Extension Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, the Secretary of Education is authorized to carry out the 
educational flexibility program under section 4 of the Education 
Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (20 U.S.C. 5891b), until the date of 
enactment of an Act that reauthorizes programs under part A of title I 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et 
seq.), for any State that was an Ed-Flex Partnership State on September 
30, 2004.
    (b) Designation.--
            (1) In general.--Any designation of a State as an Ed-Flex 
        Partnership State that was in effect on September 30, 2004, 
        shall be extended until the date of enactment of an Act that 
        reauthorizes programs under part A of title I of the Elementary 
        and Secondary Education Act of 1965, if the Secretary of 
        Education makes the determination described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Determination.--The determination referred to in 
        paragraph (1) is a determination that the performance of the 
        State educational agency, in carrying out the programs for which 
        the State has received a waiver under the educational 
        flexibility program, justifies the extension of the designation.

    Approved March 24, 2006.
