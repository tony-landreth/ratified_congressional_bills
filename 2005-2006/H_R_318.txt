                              FARMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Castle Nugent Farms, located on the southeastern shore 
        of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, is the largest parcel of 
        privately-held land in the Virgin Islands and has been an 
        operating cattle ranch for 50 years.
            (2) This land has the largest and healthiest fringing coral 
        reef anywhere in the Virgin Islands.
            (3) It consists of Caribbean dry forest and pasturelands 
        with considerable cultural resources including both pre-
        Columbian and post-European settlement.
            (4) Castle Nugent Farms contains a large historic 17th 
        century Danish estate house that sits on over 4 miles of 
        pristine Caribbean oceanfront property.
            (5) In addition to being an area for turtle nesting and 
        night heron nesting, it is the home for the Senepol cattle 
        breed, a unique breed of cattle that was developed on St. Croix 
        in the early 1900's to adapt to the island's climate.

    (b) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall carry out a study 
regarding the suitability and feasibility of designating Castle Nugent 
Farms as a unit of the National Park System.
