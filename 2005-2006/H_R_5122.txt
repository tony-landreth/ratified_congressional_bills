United States of America in Congress <<NOTE: John Warner National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007.>> assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``John Warner 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Senator John Warner of Virginia was elected a member of 
        the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term 
        beginning on January 3, 1979. He was subsequently appointed by 
        the Governor of Virginia to fill a vacancy on January 2, 1979, 
        and has served continuously since that date. He was appointed a 
        member of the Committee on Armed Services in January 1979, and 
        has served continuously on the Committee since that date, a 
        period of nearly 28 years. Senator Warner's service on the 
        Committee represents nearly half of its existence since it was 
        established after World War II.
            (2) Senator Warner came to the Senate and the Committee on 
        Armed Services after a distinguished record of service to the 
        Nation, including combat service in the Armed Forces and high 
        civilian office.
            (3) Senator Warner enlisted in the United States Navy upon 
        graduation from high school in 1945, and served until the summer 
        of 1946, when he was discharged as a Petty Officer 3rd Class. He 
        then attended Washington and Lee University on the G.I. Bill. He 
        graduated in 1949 and entered the University of Virginia Law 
        School.
            (4) Upon the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Senator 
        Warner volunteered for active duty, interrupting his education 
        to accept a commission in the United States Marine Corps. He 
        served in combat in Korea as a ground officer in the First 
        Marine Air Wing. Following his active service, he remained in 
        the Marine Corps Reserve for several years, attaining the rank 
        of captain.
            (5) Senator Warner resumed his legal education upon 
        returning from the Korean War and graduated from the University 
        of Virginia Law School in 1953. He was selected by the late 
        Chief Judge E. Barrett Prettyman of the United States Court of 
        Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as his law clerk. 
        After his service to Judge Prettyman, Senator Warner

[[Page 120 STAT. 2084]]

        became an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of 
        Columbia, and later entered private law practice.
            (6) In 1969, the Senate gave its advice and consent to the 
        appointment of Senator Warner as Under Secretary of the Navy. He 
        served in this position until 1972, when he was confirmed and 
        appointed as the 61st Secretary of the Navy since the office was 
        established in 1798. As Secretary, Senator Warner was the 
        principal United States negotiator and signatory of the 
        Incidents at Sea Executive Agreement with the Soviet Union, 
        which was signed in 1972 and remains in effect today. It has 
        served as the model for similar agreements between states 
        covering the operation of naval ships and aircraft in 
        international sea lanes throughout the world.
            (7) Senator Warner left the Department of the Navy in 1974. 
        His next public service was as Administrator of the American 
        Revolution Bicentennial Commission. In this capacity, he 
        coordinated the celebration of the Nation's founding, directing 
        the Federal role in all 50 States and in over 20 foreign 
        nations.
            (8) Senator Warner has served as chairman of the Committee 
        on Armed Services of the United States Senate from 1999 to 2001, 
        and again since January 2003. He served as ranking minority 
        member of the committee from 1987 to 1993, and again from 2001 
        to 2003. Senator Warner concludes his service as chairman at the 
        end of the 109th Congress, but will remain a member of the 
        committee.
            (9) This Act is the twenty-eighth annual authorization Act 
        for the Department of Defense for which Senator Warner has taken 
        a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the United States Senate, and the fourteenth for 
        which he has exercised a leadership role as chairman or ranking 
        minority member of the committee.
            (10) Senator Warner, as seaman, Marine officer, Under 
        Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, and member, ranking 
        minority member, and chairman of the Committee on Armed Services 
        of the United States Senate, has made unique and lasting 
        contributions to the national security of the United States.
            (11) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the 
        last annual authorization Act for the national defense managed 
        by Senator Warner in and for the United States Senate as 
        chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his 
        honor, as provided in subsection (a).

SEC. 128. <<NOTE: 10 USC 7291 note.>> ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR 
                        FUTURE SURFACE COMBATANTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Securing and maintaining access to affordable and 
        plentiful sources of energy is a vital national security 
        interest for the United States.
            (2) The Nation's dependence upon foreign oil is a threat to 
        national security due to the inherently volatile nature of the 
        global oil market and the political instability of some of the 
        world's largest oil producing states.
            (3) Given the recent increase in the cost of crude oil, 
        which cannot realistically be expected to improve over the long 
        term, other energy sources must be seriously considered.
            (4) Alternate propulsion sources such as nuclear power offer 
        many advantages over conventional power for major surface 
        combatant ships of the Navy, including--
                    (A) virtually unlimited high-speed endurance;
                    (B) elimination of vulnerable refueling; and
                    (C) reduction in the requirement for replenishment 
                vessels and the need to protect those vessels.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), 
it is the sense of Congress that the Navy should make greater use of 
alternative technologies, including expanded application of integrated 
power systems, fuel cells, and nuclear power, for propulsion of future 
major surface combatant ships.
    (c) Requirement.--The Secretary of the Navy shall include integrated 
power systems, fuel cells, and nuclear power as propulsion alternatives 
to be evaluated within the analysis of alternatives for future major 
surface combatant ships.
SEC. 129. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SIZE OF THE ATTACK 
                        SUBMARINE FORCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States Navy must be large enough, agile 
        enough, and lethal enough to deter any threat and defeat any 
        foe.
            (2) The proliferation of modern nuclear and nonnuclear 
        submarines in the navies of nations around the globe will make 
        undersea superiority a more significant challenge in the future.
            (3) The unique combination of firepower, stealth, sensors, 
        and communications equipment contained in a modern attack 
        submarine make the attack submarine a critical component of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2110]]

            (4) The report entitled ``Report to Congress on Annual Long-
        Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels for fiscal year 
        2007'', submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Navy 
        pursuant to section 231 of title 10, United States Code--
                    (A) identifies future naval force structure 
                requirements indexed to Department of Defense fiscal 
                year 2020 threat assessments and compliant with the 
                Fiscal Year 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and, with 
                respect to the attack submarine force, identifies a need 
                for the Navy to maintain a fleet of not less than 48 
                attack submarines; and
                    (B) projects that the attack submarine force will 
                fall below 48 vessels between 2020 and 2032.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings in subsection (a), 
it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Navy should take 
all reasonable effort to accelerate the construction of Virginia Class 
submarines to maintain the attack submarine force structure at not less 
than 48 submarines and (if the number of attack submarines should fall 
below 48), to minimize the period the attack submarine force remains 
below 48 vessels.

        contract are realistic.
            (6) That the use of such contract will promote the national 
        security of the United States.

In certifying that the cost savings are substantial, the Secretary shall 
duly consider the historical cost savings that led to a decision to 
proceed with a multiyear procurement contract under section 2306b of 
title 10, United States Code, in the case of previous aviation-related 
multiyear contracts authorized by law dating back to fiscal year 1982.
    (e) FFRDC Cost Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide for a

                        ON PRIORITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, 
                        AND FIELDING OF MISSILE DEFENSE 
                        CAPABILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In response to the threat posed by ballistic missiles, 
        President George W. Bush in December 2002 directed the Secretary 
        of Defense to proceed with the fielding of an initial set of 
        missile defense capabilities in 2004 and 2005.
            (2) According to assessments by the intelligence community 
        of the United States, North Korea tested in 2005 a new solid 
        propellant short-range ballistic missile, conducted a launch of 
        a Taepodong-2 ballistic missile/space launch vehicle in 2006, 
        and is likely developing intermediate-range and intercontinental 
        ballistic missile capabilities that could someday reach as far 
        as the United States with a nuclear payload.
            (3) According to assessments by the intelligence community 
        of the United States, Iran continued in 2005 to test its medium-
        range ballistic missile, and the danger that Iran will acquire a 
        nuclear weapon and integrate it with a ballistic missile Iran 
        already possesses is a reason for immediate concern.

    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that the 
Department of Defense accord a priority within the missile defense 
program to the development, testing, fielding, and improvement of 
effective near-term missile defense capabilities, including the ground-
based midcourse defense system, the Aegis ballistic missile defense 
system, the Patriot PAC-3 system, the Terminal High Altitude Area 
Defense system, and the sensors necessary to support such systems.

as the criteria for qualification at each level. Such levels of joint 
qualification shall be established by the Secretary with the advice of 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Each level shall, as a 
minimum, have both joint education criteria and joint experience 
criteria. The purpose of establishing such qualification levels is to 
ensure a systematic, progressive, career-long development of officers in 
joint matters and to ensure that officers serving as general and flag 
officers have the requisite experience and education to be highly 
proficient in joint matters.
    ``(B) The number of officers who are joint qualified shall be 
determined by the Secretary of Defense, with the advice of the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Such number shall be large enough to meet 
the requirements of subsection (d).

Secretary of Defense with the advice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff.

to designate officers as joint qualified may be delegated only to the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense or an Under Secretary of Defense.
    ``(c) Education and Experience Requirements.--(1) An officer may not 
be designated as joint qualified until the officer--
            ``(A) successfully completes an appropriate program of joint 
        professional military education, as described in subsections (b) 
        and (c) of section 2155 of this title, at a joint professional 
        military education school; and

                    ``(i) a full tour of duty in a joint assignment, as 
                described in section 664(f) of this title; or

Defense may waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(A) that an officer

or rear admiral (lower half), a waiver under paragraph (2) may be 
granted only if--
            ``(A) the officer has completed two full tours of duty in a 
        joint duty assignment, as described in section 664(f) of this 
        title, in such a manner as to demonstrate the officer's mastery 
        of knowledge, skills, and abilities on joint matters; and
            ``(B) the Secretary of Defense determines that the types of 
        joint duty experiences completed by the officer have been of 
        sufficient breadth to prepare the officer adequately for service

paragraph (2) for officers in the same pay grade during a fiscal year 
may not exceed 10 percent of the total number of officers in that pay 
grade designated as joint qualified during that fiscal year.

active duty at the same time who, while holding a general or flag 
officer position, were designated joint qualified (or were selected for 
the joint specialty before October 1, 2007) and for whom a waiver was

appropriate level of joint qualification.

the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall designate an appropriate number of 
joint duty assignment positions as critical joint duty assignment 
positions. A position may be designated as a critical joint duty 
assignment position only if the duties and responsibilities of the 
position make it important that the occupant be particularly trained in, 
and oriented toward, joint matters.
    ``(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), a position designated under 
paragraph (2) may be held only by an officer who--
            ``(i) was designated as joint qualified in accordance with 
        this chapter; or
            ``(ii) was selected for the joint specialty before October 
        1, 2007.

    ``(B) The Secretary of Defense may waive the requirement in 
subparagraph (A) with respect to the assignment of an officer to a 
position designated under paragraph (2). Any such waiver shall be 
granted on a case-by-case basis. The authority of the

Secretary to grant such a waiver may be delegated only to the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

    (a) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2007, the President shall 
transmit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of 
Representatives a report on the advisability of modifying the criteria 
for the award of the Purple Heart to authorize the award of the Purple 
Heart--
            (1) to a member of the Armed Forces who dies in captivity as 
        a prisoner of war under unknown circumstances or as a result of 
        conditions and treatment that, under criteria for eligibility 
        for the Purple Heart as in effect on the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, do not qualify the decedent for award of the Purple 
        Heart; and
            (2) to an individual who while a member of the Armed Forces 
        survives captivity as a prisoner of war, but who dies thereafter 
        as a result of disease or disability, or a result of disease and 
        condition and treatment, incurred during such captivity.

    (b) Determination.--As part of the review undertaken in order to 
prepare the report required by subsection (a), the President shall make 
a determination on the advisability of expanding eligibility for the 
award of the Purple Heart to deceased servicemembers held as a prisoner 
of war after December 7, 1941, who meet the criteria for eligibility for 
the prisoner-of-war medal under section 1128 of title 10, United States 
Code (including the criterion under subsection (e) of that section with 
respect to honorable conduct), but who do not meet the criteria for 
eligibility for the Purple Heart.
    (c) <<NOTE: President.>> Requirements.--In making the determination 
required by subsection (b), the President shall take into consideration 
the following:
            (1) The brutal treatment endured by thousands of prisoners 
        of war incarcerated by enemy forces.
            (2) The circumstance that many servicemembers held as 
        prisoners of war died during captivity due to causes that do not 
        meet the criteria for eligibility for award of the Purple Heart, 
        including starvation, abuse, the deliberate withholding of 
        medical treatment for injury or disease, or other causes.
            (3) The circumstance that some members of the Armed Forces 
        died in captivity under circumstances establishing eligibility 
        for the prisoner-of-war medal but under circumstances not 
        otherwise establishing eligibility for the Purple Heart.
            (4) The circumstance that some members and former members of 
        the Armed Forces who were held as prisoners of war and following 
        captivity were issued the prisoner-of-war medal subsequently 
        died due to a disease or disability that was incurred during 
        that captivity, without otherwise having been awarded the Purple 
        Heart due to the injury or conditions resulting in that disease 
        or disability or otherwise having been awarded the Purple Heart 
        for injury incurring during captivity.

        Department of Defense.

    (b) Applicability.--Effective <<NOTE: Effective date.>> on and after 
September 30, 2008, a member of the Armed Forces or an employee of the

subcontractor (whether or not under a contract for commercial items) for 
a major system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the

                    (B) The National Institutes of Health.
            (2) The term ``governmentwide acquisition contract'', with 
        respect to a covered non-defense agency, means a task or 
        delivery order contract that--
                    (A) is entered into by the non-defense agency; and
                    (B) may be used as the contract under which property

SEC. 818. DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT TYPE FOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

    (a) Repeal of Superseded Requirements.--Section 807 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (10 U.S.C. 2304 note) is 
repealed.
    (b) Modification of <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Regulations.--Not later than 
120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Defense shall modify the regulations of the Department of Defense 
regarding the determination of contract type for development programs.

    (c) Elements.--As modified under subsection (b), the regulations 
shall require the Milestone Decision Authority for a major defense 
acquisition program to select the contract type for a development 
program at the time of a decision on Milestone B approval (or Key 
Decision Point B approval in the case of a space program) that is 
consistent with the level of program risk for the program. The Milestone 
Decision Authority may select--
            (1) a fixed-price type contract (including a fixed price 
        incentive contract); or
            (2) a cost type contract.

    (d) Conditions With Respect to Authorization of Cost Type 
Contract.--As modified under subsection (b), the regulations shall 
provide that the Milestone Decision Authority may authorize the use of a 
cost type contract under subsection (c) for a development program only 
upon a written determination that--
            (1) the program is so complex and technically challenging 
        that it would not be practicable to reduce program risk to a 
        level that would permit the use of a fixed-price type contract; 
        and

[[Page 120 STAT. 2330]]

            (2) the complexity and technical challenge of the program is 
        not the result of a failure to meet the requirements established 
        in section 2366a of title 10, United States Code.

    (e) Justification for Selection of Contract Type.--As modified under 
subsection (b), the regulations shall require the Milestone Decision 
Authority to document the basis for the contract type selected for a 
program. The documentation shall include an explanation of the level of 
program risk for the program and, if the Milestone Decision Authority 
determines that the level of program risk is high, the steps that have 
been taken to reduce program risk and reasons for proceeding with 
Milestone B approval despite the high level of program risk.

              Subtitle C--Chemical Demilitarization Program

SEC. 921. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMPLETION OF DESTRUCTION OF UNITED 
                        STATES CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCKPILE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
        Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
        Destruction, done at Paris on January 13, 1993 (commonly 
        referred to as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention''), requires 
        that destruction of the entire United States chemical weapons 
        stockpile be completed by no later than the extended deadline of 
        April 29, 2012.
            (2) On April 10, 2006, the Department of Defense notified 
        Congress that the United States would not meet even the extended 
        deadline under the Chemical Weapons Convention for destruction 
        of the United States chemical weapons stockpile.
            (3) Destroying existing chemical weapons is a homeland 
        security imperative and an arms control priority and is required 
        by United States law.
            (4) The elimination and nonproliferation of chemical weapons 
        of mass destruction is of utmost importance to the national 
        security of the United States.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States is committed to making every effort to 
        safely dispose of its entire chemical weapons stockpile by the 
        Chemical Weapons Convention extended deadline of April 29, 2012, 
        or as soon thereafter as possible, and will carry out all of its 
        other obligations under that Convention;
            (2) to prevent further delays in completing the destruction 
        of the United States chemical weapons stockpile, the Secretary 
        of Defense should prepare a comprehensive schedule for the safe 
        destruction of such stockpile and should annually submit that 
        schedule (as currently in effect) to the congressional defense 
        committees, either separately or as part of another required 
        report, until such destruction is completed;
            (3) the Secretary of Defense should make every effort to 
        ensure adequate funding to complete the elimination of the 
        United States chemical weapons stockpile in the shortest time 
        possible, consistent with the requirement to protect public 
        health, safety, and the environment; and
            (4) when selecting a site for the treatment or disposal of 
        neutralized chemical agent at a location remote from the 
        location where the agent is stored, the Secretary of Defense 
        should propose a credible process that seeks to gain the support 
        of affected communities.

SEC. 922. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF 
                        OFF-SITE VERSUS ON-SITE TREATMENT AND 
                        DISPOSAL OF HYDROLYSATE DERIVED FROM 
                        NEUTRALIZATION OF VX NERVE GAS AT NEWPORT 
                        CHEMICAL DEPOT, INDIANA.

    (a) Review <<NOTE: Reports.>> Required.--Not later than December 1, 
2006, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report 
containing a review of the cost-benefit analysis prepared by the 
Secretary of the Army entitled ``Cost-Benefit Analysis of Off-Site 
Versus On-Site Treatment and Disposal of Newport Caustic Hydrolysate'' 
and dated April 24, 2006.

    (b) Content of Review.--In conducting the review under subsection 
(a), the Comptroller General shall consider and assess at a minimum the 
following matters:
            (1) The adequacy of the rationale contained in the cost-
        benefit analysis referred to in subsection (a) in dismissing 
        five of the eight technologies for hydrolysate treatment 
        directed for consideration on page 116 of the Report of the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on 
        H.R. 1815 (House Report 109-89).
            (2) The rationale for the failure of the Secretary of the 
        Army to consider other technical solutions, such as constructing 
        a wastewater disposal system at the Newport Chemical Depot.
            (3) The adequacy of the cost-benefit analysis presented for 
        the three technologies considered.

    (c) Limitation on Transport <<NOTE: New Jersey.>> Pending Report.--
The Secretary of the Army may not transport neutralized bulk nerve agent 
(other than those small quantities necessary for laboratory evaluation 
of the disposal process) from the Newport Chemical Depot to the State of 
New Jersey until the earlier of--
            (1) the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on 
        which the report required by subsection (a) is submitted; or
            (2) February 1, 2007.
SEC. 923. INCENTIVES CLAUSES IN CHEMICAL DEMILITARIZATION 
                        CONTRACTS.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Authority to include clauses in contracts.--The 
        Secretary of Defense may, for the purpose specified in paragraph 
        (2), authorize the inclusion of an incentives clause in any 
        contract for the destruction of the United States stockpile of 
        lethal chemical agents and munitions carried out pursuant to 
        section 1412 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 
        1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521).
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of a clause referred to in 
        paragraph (1) is to provide the contractor for a chemical 
        demilitarization facility an incentive to accelerate the safe 
        elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile and 
        to reduce the total cost of the Chemical Demilitarization 
        Program by providing incentive payments for the early completion 
        of destruction operations and the closure of such facility.

    (b) Incentives Clauses.--
            (1) In general.--An incentives clause under this section 
        shall permit the contractor for the chemical demilitarization 
        facility concerned the opportunity to earn incentive payments 
        for the completion of destruction operations and facility 
        closure

[[Page 120 STAT. 2361]]

        activities within target incentive ranges specified in such 
        clause.
            (2) Limitation on incentive payments.--The maximum incentive 
        payment under an incentives clause with respect to a chemical 
        demilitarization facility may not exceed amounts as follows:
                    (A) In the case of an incentive payment for the 
                completion of destruction operations within the target 
                incentive range specified in such clause, $110,000,000.
                    (B) In the case of an incentive payment for the 
                completion of facility closure activities within the 
                target incentive range specified in such clause, 
                $55,000,000.
            (3) Target ranges.--An incentives clause in a contract under 
        this section shall specify the target incentive ranges of costs 
        for completion of destruction operations and facility closure 
        activities, respectively, as jointly agreed upon by the 
        contracting officer and the contractor concerned. An incentives 
        clause shall require a proportionate reduction in the maximum 
        incentive payment amounts in the event that the contractor 
        exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are the 
        responsibility of the contractor.
            (4) Calculation of incentive payments.--The amount of the 
        incentive payment earned by a contractor for a chemical 
        demilitarization facility under an incentives clause under this 
        section shall be based upon a determination by the Secretary on 
        how early in the target incentive range specified in such clause 
        destruction operations or facility closure activities, as the 
        case may be, are completed.
            (5) Consistency with existing obligations.--The provisions 
        of any incentives clause under this section shall be consistent 
        with the obligation of the Secretary of Defense under section 
        1412(c)(1)(A) of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 
        1986, to provide for maximum protection for the environment, the 
        general public, and the personnel who are involved in the 
        destruction of the lethal chemical agents and munitions.
            (6) Additional terms and conditions.--In negotiating the

SEC. 946. REPORT ON THE POSTURE OF UNITED STATES SPECIAL 
                        OPERATIONS COMMAND TO CONDUCT THE GLOBAL 
                        WAR ON TERRORISM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends an 
        increase in the size of the United States Special Operations 
        Command as a fundamental part of the efforts of the Department 
        of Defense to fight the global war on terrorism.
            (2) Special operations forces conducting all nine of their 
        statutory activities, as specified in section 167(j) of title 
        10, United States Code, play a crucial role in the global war on 
        terrorism, and the Department of Defense should take a balanced 
        approach to the expansion of the force structure of that command 
        to provide additional capability in both the active and reserve 
        components.
            (3) Special operations forces are engaged in operations 
        across the globe and in extreme and varied operational 
        environments which require specialized training to successfully 
        operate in those environments.
            (4) Due to the global and long-term nature of the global war 
        on terrorism, the Secretary of Defense should assess whether the 
        United States Special Operations Command has

[[Page 120 STAT. 2369]]

        the appropriate force structure and training focus required for 
        successful operations in the global war on terrorism.

    (b) Report on Posture of SOCOM to Conduct the Global War on 
Terrorism.--Not later than six months after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report assessing the posture of the United States 
Special Operations Command to conduct the global war on terrorism. The 
Secretary shall include in the report the following:
            (1) The Secretary's assessment of whether the United States 
        Special Operations Command is appropriately manned, resourced, 
        and equipped to successfully meet the long-term requirements of 
        the global war on terrorism.
            (2) The Secretary's assessment whether the expansion of that 
        command as recommended in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review 
        provides an appropriate balance between active and reserve 
        component capabilities.
            (3) The Secretary's assessment of whether United States 
        Special Operations Command has sufficient Army Special Forces to 
        meet the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review objective of building 
        allied and partner nation capacity through security assistance 
        and other training missions such as the Joint Combined Exchange 
        Training program.
            (4) A detailed statement of the efforts of the commander of 
        the United States Special Operations Command to provide special 
        operations forces personnel with specialized environmental 
        training in preparation for operations across the globe and in 
        extreme and varied operational environments such as mountain, 
        jungle, or desert environments.

SEC. 1026. REPORT ON UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR OPERATION BAHAMAS, 
                          TURKS & CAICOS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 1982 the United States Government created Operation 
        Bahamas, Turks & Caicos (OPBAT) to counter the smuggling of 
        cocaine into the United States.
            (2) According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, an estimated 
        80 percent of the cocaine entering the United States in the 
        1980s came through the Bahamas, whereas, according to the Office 
        of National Drug Control Policy, only an estimated 10 percent 
        comes through the Bahamas today.
            (3) According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, more than 
        80,000 kilograms of cocaine and nearly 700,000 pounds of 
        marijuana have been seized in Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos 
        since 1986, with a combined street value of approximately two 
        billion dollars.
            (4) The Army has provided military airlift to law 
        enforcement officials under Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos to 
        create an effective, reliable, and immediate response capability 
        for drug interdiction. This support is largely responsible for 
        the decline in cocaine shipments to the United States through 
        the Bahamas.
            (5) The Bahamas is an island nation composed of 
        approximately 700 islands and keys, which makes aviation assets 
        the best and most efficient method of transporting law 
        enforcement agents and interdicting smugglers.
            (6) It is in the interests of the United States to maintain 
        the results of the successful Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos 
        program and prevent drug smugglers from rebuilding their 
        operations through the Bahamas.

    (b) Report on United States Government Support for OPBAT.--
            (1) Report on decision to withdraw.--Not later than 30 days 
        before implementing a decision to withdraw Department of Defense 
        helicopters from Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Congress a report 
        outlining the plan for the coordination of the Operation 
        Bahamas, Turks & Caicos mission, at the same level of 
        effectiveness, using other United States Government assets.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2385]]

            (2) Consultation.--The Secretary of Defense shall consult 
        with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security, and with other appropriate 
        officials of the United States Government, in preparing the 
        report under paragraph (1).
            (3) Elements.--The report under paragraph (1) on the 
        withdrawal of equipment referred to in that paragraph shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An explanation of the military justification for 
                the withdrawal of the equipment.
                    (B) An assessment of the availability of other 
                options (including other Government helicopters) to 
                provide the capability being provided by the equipment 
                to be withdrawn.
                    (C) An explanation of how each option specified 
                under subparagraph (B) will provide the capability 
                currently provided by the equipment to be withdrawn.
                    (D) An assessment of the potential use of unmanned 
                aerial vehicles in Operation Bahamas, Turks & Caicos, 
                including the capabilities of such vehicles and any 
                advantages or disadvantages associated with the use of 
                such vehicles in that operation, and a recommendation on 
                whether or not to deploy such vehicles in that 
                operation.

                          OF MEDICAL CARE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:

[[Page 120 STAT. 2424]]

            (1) The Secretary of Defense has discretionary authority to 
        permit space-available travel on military aircraft for various 
        reasons, including humanitarian purposes.
            (2) Recently, 110 Iraqi children journeyed 22 hours by bus 
        from Baghdad, Iraq, to Amman, Jordan, for urgently needed oral/
        facial surgery. While traveling, armed insurgents stopped and 
        boarded the children's bus, raising serious questions about the 
        safety of further travel by ground.
            (3) Pursuant to the Secretary's discretionary authority 
        referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary authorized the Iraqi 
        children to travel on military aircraft for their return trip 
        from Amman to Baghdad.
            (4) The Secretary is to be commended for his initiative in 
        providing for the safe return of these children to Iraq by 
        military aircraft.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should continue to provide space-available travel 
on military aircraft for humanitarian reasons to Iraqi children who 
would otherwise have no means available to seek urgently needed medical 
care such as that provided by a humanitarian organization in Amman, 
Jordan.
SEC. 1224. SENSE OF CONGRESS OPPOSING THE GRANTING OF AMNESTY BY 
                          THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ TO PERSONS KNOWN

                          MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED 
                          FORCES IN IRAQ.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition 
        military forces are serving heroically in Iraq to provide all 
        the people of Iraq a better future.
            (2) The Armed Forces of the United States and coalition 
        military forces have served bravely in Iraq since the beginning 
        of military operations in March of 2003.
            (3) As of June 15, 2006, more than 2,500 members of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States and members of coalition 
        military forces have been killed and more than 18,000 have been 
        injured in operations to bring peace and stability to all the 
        people of Iraq.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Iraqi sovereignty.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        goal of the United States and of the coalition partners of the 
        United States has been to empower the Iraqi people and, in doing 
        so, to recognize their freedom to exercise full sovereignty.
            (2) Amnesty.--Recognizing the sovereignty of the Iraqi 
        people as referred to in paragraph (1), it is further the sense 
        of Congress that the Government of Iraq, consistent with that 
        sovereignty, should not grant amnesty to persons known to have 
        attacked, killed, or wounded members of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States.

        members of the United States Armed Forces, civilian officials of 
        the United States Government, thousands of innocent Iraqi 
        civilians, and innocent civilians of other nations.
            (3) Zarqawi publicly swore his allegiance to Osama bin Laden 
        and al-Qaeda in 2004, and changed the name of his terrorist 
        organization from the ``Monotheism and Holy War Group'' to ``al-
        Qaeda in Iraq''.
            (4) In an audiotape broadcast in December 2004, Osama bin 
        Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda's worldwide terrorist 
        organization, called Zarqawi ``the prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq''.
            (5) Three perpetrators confessed to being paid by Zarqawi to 
        carry out the October 2002 assassination of the United States 
        diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in Amman, Jordan.
            (6) The Monotheism and Holy War Group claimed responsibility 
        for--
                    (A) the August 2003 suicide attack that destroyed 
                the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad and killed 
                the United Nations envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de 
                Mello, along with 21 other people; and
                    (B) the suicide attack on the Imam Ali Mosque in 
                Najaf that occurred less than two weeks later, which 
                killed at least 85 people, including the Ayatollah Sayed 
                Mohammed Baqr al-Hakim, and wounded dozens more.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2429]]

            (7) Zarqawi is believed to have personally beheaded American 
        hostage Nicholas Berg in May 2004.
            (8) In May 2004, Zarqawi was implicated in a car bombing 
        that killed Izzadine Salim, the rotating president of the Iraqi 
        Governing Council.
            (9) In November 2005, al-Qaeda in Iraq attacked three hotels 
        in Amman, Jordan, killing at least 67 innocent civilians.
            (10) Zarqawi and his terrorist organization were directly 
        responsible for numerous other brutal terrorist attacks against 
        the American and coalition forces, Iraqi security forces and 
        recruits, and innocent Iraqi civilians.
            (11) Zarqawi sought to turn Iraq into a safe haven for al-
        Qaeda.
            (12) To achieve that end, Zarqawi stated his opposition to 
        the democratically elected government of Iraq and worked to 
        divide the Iraqi people, foment sectarian violence, and incite a 
        civil war in Iraq.
            (13) The members of the United States Armed Forces, the 
        intelligence community, and other Federal agencies, along with 
        coalition partners and the Iraqi Security Forces, should be 
        commended for their courage and extraordinary efforts to track 
        down the most wanted terrorist in Iraq and to secure a free and 
        prosperous future for the people of Iraq.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress--
            (1) commends the United States Armed Forces, the 
        intelligence community, and other Federal agencies, along with 
        coalition partners, for the actions taken through June 7, 2006, 
        that resulted in the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader 
        of the al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist organization and the most 
        wanted terrorist in Iraq;
            (2) commends the United States Armed Forces, the 
        intelligence community, and other agencies for the action 
        referred to in paragraph (1) and their exemplary performance in 
        striving to bring freedom, democracy, and security to the people 
        of Iraq;
            (3) commends the coalition partners of the United States, 
        the new government of Iraq, and members of the Iraqi Security 
        Forces for their invaluable assistance in the operation referred 
        to in paragraph (1) and their extraordinary efforts to secure a 
        free and prosperous Iraq;
            (4) commends United States civilian and military leadership 
        for their continuing efforts to eliminate the leadership of al-
        Qaeda in Iraq, and also commends the new government of Iraq, led 
        by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, for its contribution to that 
        achievement;
            (5) recognizes that the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a 
        victory for American and coalition forces in the global war on 
        terror and a blow to the al-Qaeda terrorist organization;
            (6) commends Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on the 
        finalization of the new Iraqi cabinet;
            (7) urges the democratically elected government in Iraq to 
        use this opportunity to defeat the terrorist enemy, to put an 
        end to ethnic and sectarian violence, and to achieve a free, 
        prosperous, and secure future for Iraq; and
            (8) affirms that the Congress will continue to support the 
        United States Armed Forces, the democratically elected unity

                          REPRESENTATIVES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Representative Joel Hefley was elected to represent 
        Colorado's 5th Congressional district in 1986 and has served in 
        the House of Representatives since that time with distinction, 
        class, integrity, and honor.
            (2) Representative Hefley has served on the Committee on

        including service as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Military 
        Installations and Facilities from 1995 through 2000 and, since 
        2001, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness.
            (3) Representative Hefley's colleagues know him to be a fair 
        and effective lawmaker who works for the national interest while 
        never forgetting his Western roots.
            (4) Representative Hefley's efforts on the Committee on 
        Armed Services have been instrumental to the military value of, 
        and quality of life at, installations in the State of Colorado, 
        including Fort Carson, Cheyenne Mountain, Peterson Air Force 
        Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Buckley Air Force Base, and the 
        United States Air Force Academy.
            (5) Representative Hefley was a leader in efforts to retain 
        and expand Fort Carson as an essential part of the national 
        defense system during the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
        process.
            (6) Representative Hefley has consistently advocated for

        quality, safe, and affordable housing and supportive 
        communities.
            (7) As a primary architect of the Military Housing 
        Privatization Initiative, Representative Hefley helped lead

[[Page 120 STAT. 2445]]

        congressional efforts to establish this initiative to eliminate 
        inadequate housing on military installations, and the first 
        pilot program was located at Fort Carson.
            (8) Representative Hefley's leadership on the Military 
        Housing Privatization Initiative has allowed for the 
        privatization of more than 121,000 units of military family 
        housing, which brought meaningful improvements to living 
        conditions for thousands of members of the Armed Forces and 
        their spouses and children at installations throughout the 
        United States.

    (b) Recognition.--Congress recognizes and commends Representative 
Joel Hefley for his 20 years of service to benefit the people of 
Colorado, members of the Armed Forces and their families, veterans, and 
the United States.

                        NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMPLEX.

    ``(a) Plan Required.--The Secretary of Energy shall develop a plan 
to transform the nuclear weapons complex so as to achieve a responsive 
infrastructure by 2030. The plan shall be designed to accomplish the 
following objectives:
            ``(1) To maintain the safety, reliability, and security of 
        the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.
            ``(2) To continue Stockpile Life Extension Programs that the 
        Nuclear Weapons Council considers necessary.
            ``(3) To prepare to produce replacement warheads under the 
        Reliable Replacement Warhead program at a rate necessary to meet 
        future stockpile requirements, commencing with a first 
        production unit in 2012 and achieving steady-state production 
        using modern manufacturing processes by 2025.
            ``(4) To eliminate, within the nuclear weapons complex, 
        duplication of production capability except to the extent 
        required to ensure the safety, reliability, and security of the 
        stockpile.
            ``(5) To maintain the current philosophy within the national 
        security laboratories of peer review of nuclear weapons designs 
        while eliminating duplication of laboratory capabilities except 
        to the extent required to ensure the safety, reliability, and 
        security of the stockpile.

SEC. 3123. EDUCATION OF FUTURE NUCLEAR ENGINEERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense and the Department of Energy 
        depend on the specialized expertise of nuclear engineers who 
        support the development and sustainment of technologies 
        including naval reactors, strategic weapons, and nuclear power 
        plants.
            (2) Experts estimate that over 25 percent of the 
        approximately 58,000 workers in the nuclear power industry in 
        the United States will be eligible to retire within 5 years, 
        representing both a huge loss of institutional memory and a 
        potential national security crisis.
            (3) This shortfall of workers is exacerbated by reductions 
        to the University Reactor Infrastructure and Education 
        Assistance program, which trains civilian nuclear scientists and 
        engineers. The defense and civilian nuclear industries are 
        interdependent on a limited number of educational institutions 
        to produce their workforce. A reduction in nuclear scientists 
        and engineers trained in the civilian sector may result in a 
        further loss of qualified personnel for defense-related research 
        and engineering.
            (4) The Department of Defense's successful Science, Math and 
        Research for Transformation (SMART) scholarship-for-service 
        program serves as a good model for a targeted scholarship or 
        fellowship program designed to educate future scientists at the 
        postsecondary and postgraduate levels.

    (b) Report on Education of Future Nuclear Engineers.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of Energy shall study the 
        feasibility and merit of establishing a targeted scholarship or 
        fellowship program to educate future nuclear engineers at the 
        postsecondary and postgraduate levels.

[[Page 120 STAT. 2512]]

            (2) Report <<NOTE: President.>> required.--The President 
        shall submit to the congressional defense committees, at the 
        same time that the budget for fiscal year 2008 is submitted 
        under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, a report 
        on the study conducted by the Secretary of Energy under 
        paragraph (1).
