To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow members of the Armed

    (a) In General.--Subsection (f) of section 219 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 <<NOTE: 26 USC 219.>> is amended by redesignating 
paragraph (7) as paragraph (8) and by inserting after paragraph (6) the

        subsections (b)(1)(B) and (c), the amount of compensation 
        includible in an individual's gross income shall be determined 
        without regard to section 112.''.

    (b)  <<NOTE: 26 USC 219 note.>> Effective Date.--The amendments made 
by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 
31, 2003.

    (c)  <<NOTE: 26 USC 219 note.>> Contributions for Taxable Years 
Ending Before Enactment.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of any taxpayer with respect to 
        whom compensation was excluded from gross income under section 
        112 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for any taxable year 
        beginning after December 31, 2003, and ending before the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, any contribution to an individual 
        retirement plan made on account of such taxable year and not 
        later than the last day of the 3-year period beginning on the 
        date of the enactment of this Act shall be treated, for purposes 
        of such Code, as having been made on the last day of such 
        taxable year.
            (2) Waiver of limitations.--
                    (A) Credit or refund.--If the credit or refund of 
                any overpayment of tax resulting from a contribution to 
                which paragraph (1) applies is prevented at any time by 
                the operation of any law or rule of law (including res 
                judicata), such credit or refund may nevertheless be 
                allowed

[[Page 120 STAT. 386]]

                or made if the claim therefor is filed before the close 
                of the 1-year period beginning on the date that such 
                contribution is made (determined without regard to 
                paragraph (1)).
                    (B) Assessment of deficiency.--The period for 
                assessing a deficiency attributable to a contribution to 
                which paragraph (1) applies shall not expire before the 
                close of the 3-year period beginning on the date that 
                such contribution is made. Such deficiency may be 
                assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period 
                notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or rule 
                of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.
            (3) Individual retirement plan defined.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, the term ``individual retirement plan'' has the 
        meaning given such term by section 7701(a)(37) of such Code.

    Approved May 29, 2006.
