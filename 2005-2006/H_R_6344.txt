``SEC. 707. HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Establishment.--
            ``(1) In general.--There is established in the Office a 
        program to be known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas 
        Program (in this section referred to as the `Program').
            ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of the Program is to reduce drug 
        trafficking and drug production in the United States by--

[[Page 120 STAT. 3519]]

                    ``(A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, 
                local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to share 
                information and implement coordinated enforcement 
                activities;
                    ``(B) enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing 
                among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement 
                agencies;
                    ``(C) providing reliable law enforcement 
                intelligence to law enforcement agencies needed to 
                design effective enforcement strategies and operations; 
                and
                    ``(D) supporting coordinated law enforcement 
                strategies which maximize use of available resources to 
                reduce the supply of illegal drugs in designated areas 
                and in the United States as a whole.

    ``(b) Designation.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Director, in consultation with the 
        Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary 
        of Homeland Security, heads of the National Drug Control Program 
        agencies, and the Governor of each applicable State, may 
        designate any specified area of the United States as a high 
        intensity drug trafficking area.
            ``(2) Activities.--After making a designation under 
        paragraph (1) and in order to provide Federal assistance to the 
        area so designated, the Director may--
                    ``(A) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the 
                Program;
                    ``(B) direct the temporary reassignment of Federal 
                personnel to such area, subject to the approval of the 
                head of the department or agency that employs such 
                personnel;
                    ``(C) take any other action authorized under section 
                704 to provide increased Federal assistance to those 
                areas; and
                    ``(D) coordinate activities under this section 
                (specifically administrative, recordkeeping, and funds 
                management activities) with State, local, and tribal 
                officials.

    ``(c) Petitions for Designation.--
The <<NOTE: Regulations.>> Director shall establish regulations under 
which a coalition of interested law enforcement agencies from an area 
may petition for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area. 
Such regulations shall provide for a regular review by the Director of 
the petition, including a recommendation regarding the merit of the 
petition to the Director by a panel of qualified, independent experts.

    ``(d) Factors for Consideration.--In considering whether to 
designate an area under this section as a high intensity drug 
trafficking area, the Director shall consider, in addition to such other 
criteria as the Director considers to be appropriate, the extent to 
which--
            ``(1) the area is a significant center of illegal drug 
        production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;
            ``(2) State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have 
        committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem 
        in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond 
        aggressively to the problem;
            ``(3) drug-related activities in the area are having a 
        significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of 
        the country; and

[[Page 120 STAT. 3520]]

            ``(4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal 
        resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related 
        activities in the area.

    ``(e) Organization of High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.--
            ``(1) Executive <<NOTE: Establishment.>> board and 
        officers.--To be eligible for funds appropriated under this 
        section, each high intensity drug trafficking area shall be 
        governed by an Executive Board. The Executive Board shall 
        designate a chairman, vice chairman, and any other officers to 
        the Executive Board that it determines are necessary.
            ``(2) Responsibilities.--The Executive Board of a high 
        intensity drug trafficking area shall be responsible for--
                    ``(A) providing direction and oversight in 
                establishing and achieving the goals of the high 
                intensity drug trafficking area;
                    ``(B) managing the funds of the high intensity drug 
                trafficking area;
                    ``(C) reviewing and approving all funding proposals 
                consistent with the overall objective of the high 
                intensity drug trafficking area; and
                    ``(D) reviewing and approving all reports to the 
                Director on the activities of the high intensity drug 
                trafficking area.
            ``(3) Board representation.--None of the funds appropriated 
        under this section may be expended for any high intensity drug 
        trafficking area, or for a partnership or region of a high 
        intensity drug trafficking area, if the Executive Board for such 
        area, region, or partnership, does not apportion an equal number 
        of votes between representatives of participating Federal 
        agencies and representatives of participating State, local, and 
        tribal agencies. Where it is impractical for an equal number of 
        representatives of Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal 
        agencies to attend a meeting of an Executive Board in person, 
        the Executive Board may use a system of proxy votes or weighted 
        votes to achieve the voting balance required by this paragraph.
            ``(4) No agency relationship.--The eligibility requirements 
        of this section are intended to ensure the responsible use of 
        Federal funds. Nothing in this section is intended to create an 
        agency relationship between individual high intensity drug 
        trafficking areas and the Federal Government.

    ``(f) Use of Funds.--The Director shall ensure that no Federal funds 
appropriated for the Program are expended for the establishment or 
expansion of drug treatment programs, and shall ensure that not more 
than 5 percent of the Federal funds appropriated for the Program are 
expended for the establishment of drug prevention programs.
    ``(g) Counterterrorism Activities.--
            ``(1) Assistance authorized.--The Director may authorize use 
        of resources available for the Program to assist Federal, State, 
        local, and tribal law enforcement agencies in investigations and 
        activities related to terrorism and prevention of terrorism, 
        especially but not exclusively with respect to such 
        investigations and activities that are also related to drug 
        trafficking.
            ``(2) Limitation.--The Director shall ensure--
                    ``(A) that assistance provided under paragraph (1) 
                remains incidental to the purpose of the Program to 
                reduce

[[Page 120 STAT. 3521]]

                drug availability and carry out drug-related law 
                enforcement activities; and
                    ``(B) that significant resources of the Program are 
                not redirected to activities exclusively related to 
                terrorism, except on a temporary basis under 
                extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the 
                Director.

    ``(h) Role of Drug Enforcement Administration.--The Director, in 
consultation with the Attorney General, shall ensure that a 
representative of the Drug Enforcement Administration is included in the 
Intelligence Support Center for each high intensity drug trafficking 
area.
    ``(i) Annual HIDTA Program Budget Submissions.--As part of the 
documentation that supports the President's annual budget request for 
the Office, the Director shall submit to Congress a budget justification 
that includes--
            ``(1) the amount proposed for each high intensity drug 
        trafficking area, conditional upon a review by the Office of the 
        request submitted by the HIDTA and the performance of the HIDTA, 
        with supporting narrative descriptions and rationale for each 
        request;
            ``(2) a detailed justification that explains--
                    ``(A) the reasons for the proposed funding level; 
                how such funding level was determined based on a current 
                assessment of the drug trafficking threat in each high 
                intensity drug trafficking area;
                    ``(B) how such funding will ensure that the goals 
                and objectives of each such area will be achieved; and
                    ``(C) how such funding supports the National Drug 
                Control Strategy; and
            ``(3) the amount of HIDTA funds used to investigate and 
        prosecute organizations and individuals trafficking in 
        methamphetamine in the prior calendar year, and a description of 
        how those funds were used.

    ``(j) Emerging Threat Response Fund.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to the availability of 
        appropriations, the Director may expend up to 10 percent of the 
        amounts appropriated under this section on a discretionary 
        basis, to respond to any emerging drug trafficking threat in an 
        existing high intensity drug trafficking area, or to establish a 
        new high intensity drug trafficking area or expand an existing 
        high intensity drug trafficking area, in accordance with the 
        criteria established under paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Consideration of impact.--In allocating funds under 
        this subsection, the Director shall consider--
                    ``(A) the impact of activities funded on reducing 
                overall drug traffic in the United States, or minimizing 
                the probability that an emerging drug trafficking threat 
                will spread to other areas of the United States; and
                    ``(B) such other criteria as the Director considers 
                appropriate.

                        1701 note.>> FUNDING FOR CERTAIN HIGH 
                        INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Dawson Family 
Community Protection Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress <<NOTE: Carnell Dawson. Angela Dawson. 21 
USC 1706 note.>> finds the following:
            (1) In the early morning hours of October 16, 2002, the home 
        of Carnell and Angela Dawson was firebombed in apparent 
        retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's notification to police about 
        persistent drug distribution activity in their East Baltimore 
        City neighborhood.
            (2) The arson claimed the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson and 
        their 5 young children, aged 9 to 14.
            (3) The horrific murder of the Dawson family is a stark 
        example of domestic narco-terrorism.
            (4) In all phases of counternarcotics law enforcement--from 
        prevention to investigation to prosecution to reentry--the 
        voluntary cooperation of ordinary citizens is a critical 
        component.
            (5) Voluntary cooperation is difficult for law enforcement 
        officials to obtain when citizens feel that cooperation carries 
        the risk of violent retaliation by illegal drug trafficking 
        organizations and their affiliates.
            (6) Public confidence that law enforcement is doing all it 
        can to make communities safe is a prerequisite for voluntary 
        cooperation among people who may be subject to intimidation or 
        reprisal (or both).
            (7) Witness protection programs are insufficient on their 
        own to provide security because many individuals and families 
        who strive every day to make distressed neighborhoods livable 
        for their children, other relatives, and neighbors will resist 
        or refuse offers of relocation by local, State, and Federal 
        prosecutorial agencies and because, moreover, the continued 
        presence of strong individuals and families is critical to 
        preserving and strengthening the social fabric in such 
        communities.
            (8) Where (as in certain sections of Baltimore City) 
        interstate trafficking of illegal drugs has severe ancillary 
        local consequences within areas designated as high intensity 
        drug trafficking areas, it is important that supplementary High 
        Intensity

[[Page 120 STAT. 3525]]

        Drug Trafficking Areas Program funds be committed to support 
        initiatives aimed at making the affected communities safe for 
        the residents of those communities and encouraging their 
        cooperation with tribal, local, State, and Federal law 
        enforcement efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking.

    (c) Funding for Certain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.--
Section 707, as amended by section 301, is amended by adding at the end 
the following:
    ``(q) Specific Purposes.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Director shall ensure that, of the 
        amounts appropriated for a fiscal year for the Program, at least 
        $7,000,000 is used in high intensity drug trafficking areas with 
        severe neighborhood safety and illegal drug distribution 
        problems.
            ``(2) Required uses.--The funds used under paragraph (1) 
        shall be used--
                    ``(A) to ensure the safety of neighborhoods and the 
                protection of communities, including the prevention of 
                the intimidation of potential witnesses of illegal drug 
                distribution and related activities; and
                    ``(B) to combat illegal drug trafficking through 
                such methods as the Director considers appropriate, such 
                as establishing or operating (or both) a toll-free 
                telephone hotline for use by the public to provide 
                information about illegal drug-related activities.''.
SEC. 303. <<NOTE: New York. New Jersey.>> ASSESSMENT.

    The Director shall assess the ability of the HIDTA Program to 
respond to the so-called ``balloon effect'', whereby urban drug 
traffickers facing intensive law enforcement efforts expand and spread 
their trafficking and distribution into rural, suburban, and smaller 
urban areas by conducting a demonstration project examining the ability 
of the New York/New Jersey HIDTA, with its new single colocated 
Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force/High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Area Strike Force and HIDTA Regional Intelligence Center, to 
address the movement of drug traffickers into the more rural, suburban, 
and smaller areas encompassed by the counties of Albany, Onondaga, 
Monroe, and Erie in New York State and by annexing these counties into 
the existing New York/New Jersey HIDTA.
