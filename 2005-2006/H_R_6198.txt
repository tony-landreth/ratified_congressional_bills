                        NONPROLIFERATION OF IRAN

SEC. 401. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It should be the policy of the United States 
not to bring into force an agreement for cooperation with the government 
of any country that is assisting the nuclear program of Iran or 
transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles to Iran unless 
the President has determined that--
            (1) Iran has suspended all enrichment-related and 
        reprocessing-related activity (including uranium conversion and 
        research and development, manufacturing, testing, and assembly 
        relating to enrichment and reprocessing), has committed to 
        verifiably refrain permanently from such activity in the future 
        (except potentially the conversion of uranium exclusively for 
        export to foreign nuclear fuel production facilities pursuant to 
        internationally agreed arrangements and subject to strict 
        international safeguards), and is abiding by that commitment; or
            (2) the government of that country--
                    (A) has, either on its own initiative or pursuant to 
                a binding decision of the United Nations Security 
                Council, suspended all nuclear assistance to Iran and 
                all transfers of advanced conventional weapons and 
                missiles to Iran, pending a decision by Iran to 
                implement measures that would permit the President to 
                make the determination described in paragraph (1); and
                    (B) is committed to maintaining that suspension 
                until Iran has implemented measures that would permit 
                the President to make such determination.

    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Agreement for cooperation.--The term ``agreement for 
        cooperation'' has the meaning given that term in section 11 b. 
        of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2014(b)).
            (2) Assisting the nuclear program of iran.--The term 
        ``assisting the nuclear program of Iran'' means the intentional 
        transfer to Iran by a government, or by a person subject to the 
        jurisdiction of a government, with the knowledge and 
        acquiescence of that government, of goods, services, or 
        technology listed on the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines for

            (3) Transferring advanced conventional weapons or missiles 
        to iran.--The term ``transferring advanced conventional weapons 
        or missiles to Iran'' means the intentional transfer to Iran by 
        a government, or by a person subject to the jurisdiction of a 
        government, with the knowledge and acquiescence of that 
        government, of--

[[Page 120 STAT. 1350]]

                    (A) advanced conventional weapons; or
                    (B) goods, services, or technology listed on the 
                Missile Technology Control Regime Equipment and
