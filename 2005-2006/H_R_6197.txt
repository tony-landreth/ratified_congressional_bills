SEC. 318. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION OF NUTRITION TO 
            THE HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) good nutrition is vital to good health, and a diet based 
        on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans may reduce the risk of 
        chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, 
        diabetes, macular degeneration, and cancer;
            (2) the American Dietetic Association and the American 
        Academy of Family Physicians have estimated that the percentage 
        of older adults who are malnourished is estimated at 20 to 60 
        percent for those who are in home care and at 40 to 85 percent 
        for those who are in nursing homes;
            (3) the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of 
        Sciences has estimated that approximately 40 percent of 
        community-residing persons age 65 and older have inadequate 
        nutrient intakes;
            (4) older adults are susceptible to nutrient deficiencies 
        for a number of reasons, including a reduced capacity to absorb 
        and utilize nutrients, difficulty chewing, and loss of appetite;
            (5) while diet is the preferred source of nutrition, 
        evidence suggests that the use of a single daily multivitamin-
        mineral supplement may be an effective way to address 
        nutritional gaps that exist among the elderly population, 
        especially the poor; and
            (6) the Dietary Guidelines for Americans state that 
        multivitamin-mineral supplements may be useful when they fill a 
        specific identified nutrient gap that cannot be or is not 
        otherwise being met by the individual's intake of food.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) meal programs funded by the Older Americans Act of 1965 
        contribute to the nutritional health of older adults;
            (2) when the nutritional needs of older adults are not fully 
        met by diet, use of a single, daily multivitamin-mineral 
        supplement may help prevent nutrition deficiencies common in 
        many older adults;

[[Page 120 STAT. 2551]]

            (3) use of a single, daily multivitamin-mineral supplement 
        can be a safe and inexpensive strategy to help ensure the 
        nutritional health of older adults; and
            (4) nutrition service providers under the Older Americans 
        Act of 1965 should consider whether individuals participating in 
        congregate and home-delivered meal programs would benefit from a 
        single, daily multivitamin-mineral supplement that is in 
        compliance with all applicable government quality standards and 
        provides at least \2/3\ of the essential vitamins and minerals 
        at 100 percent of the daily value levels as determined by the 
        Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
