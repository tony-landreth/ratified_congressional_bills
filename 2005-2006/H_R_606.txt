SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Angel Island Immigration Station, also known as the 
        Ellis Island of the West, is a National Historic Landmark.
            (2) Between 1910 and 1940, the Angel Island Immigration 
        Station processed more than 1,000,000 immigrants and emigrants 
        from around the world.
            (3) The Angel Island Immigration Station contributes greatly 
        to our understanding of our Nation's rich and complex 
        immigration history.
            (4) The Angel Island Immigration Station was built to 
        enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and subsequent 
        immigration laws, which unfairly and severely restricted Asian 
        immigration.
            (5) During their detention at the Angel Island Immigration 
        Station, Chinese detainees carved poems into the walls of the 
        detention barracks. More than 140 poems remain today, 
        representing the unique voices of immigrants awaiting entry to 
        this country.
            (6) More than 50,000 people, including 30,000 
        schoolchildren, visit the Angel Island Immigration Station 
        annually to learn more about the experience of immigrants who 
        have traveled to our shores.
            (7) The restoration of the Angel Island Immigration Station 
        and the preservation of the writings and drawings at the Angel 
        Island Immigration Station will ensure that future generations 
        also have the benefit of experiencing and appreciating this 
        great symbol of the perseverance of the immigrant spirit, and of 
        the diversity of this great Nation.
