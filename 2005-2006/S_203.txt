        history, including 8 Pueblos and the descendants of Spanish 
        ancestors who settled in the area in 1598;
            (2) the combination of cultures, languages, folk arts, 
        customs, and architecture make northern New Mexico unique;
            (3) the area includes spectacular natural, scenic, and 
        recreational resources;
            (4) there is broad support from local governments and 
        interested individuals to establish a National Heritage Area to 
        coordinate and assist in the preservation and interpretation of 
        these resources;
            (5) in 1991, the National Park Service study Alternative 
        Concepts for Commemorating Spanish Colonization identified 
        several alternatives consistent with the establishment of a 
        National Heritage Area, including conducting a comprehensive 
        archaeological and historical research program, coordinating a 
        comprehensive interpretation program, and interpreting a 
        cultural heritage scene; and
            (6) establishment of a National Heritage Area in northern 
        New Mexico would assist local communities and residents in 
        preserving these unique cultural, historical and natural 
        resources.

Subtitle D-- <<NOTE: Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area Act. Utah. 16 
USC 461 note.>> Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area

SEC. 251. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Mormon Pioneer National Heritage 
Area Act''.

SEC. 252. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the historical, cultural, and natural heritage legacies 
        of Mormon colonization and settlement are nationally 
        significant;
            (2) in the area starting along the Highway 89 corridor at 
        the Arizona border, passing through Kane, Garfield, Piute, 
        Sevier, Wayne, and Sanpete Counties in the State of Utah,

[[Page 120 STAT. 1801]]

        and terminating in Fairview, Utah, there are a variety of 
        heritage resources that demonstrate--
                    (A) the colonization of the western United States; 
                and
                    (B) the expansion of the United States as a major 
                world power;
            (3) the great relocation to the western United States was 
        facilitated by--
                    (A) the 1,400-mile trek from Illinois to the Great 
                Salt Lake by the Mormon pioneers; and
                    (B) the subsequent colonization effort in Nevada, 
                Utah, the southeast corner of Idaho, the southwest 
                corner of Wyoming, large areas of southeastern Oregon, 
                much of southern California, and areas along the eastern 
                border of California;
            (4) the 250-mile Highway 89 corridor from Kanab to Fairview, 
        Utah, contains some of the best features of the Mormon 
        colonization experience in the United States;
            (5) the landscape, architecture, traditions, beliefs, folk 
        life, products, and events along Highway 89 convey the heritage 
        of the pioneer settlement;
            (6) the Boulder Loop, Capitol Reef National Park, Zion 
        National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and the Highway 89 
        area convey the compelling story of how early settlers--
                    (A) interacted with Native Americans; and
                    (B) established towns and cities in a harsh, yet 
                spectacular, natural environment;
            (7) the colonization and settlement of the Mormon settlers 
        opened up vast amounts of natural resources, including coal, 
        uranium, silver, gold, and copper;
            (8) the Mormon colonization played a significant role in the 
        history and progress of the development and settlement of the 
        western United States; and
            (9) the artisans, crafters, innkeepers, outfitters, farmers, 
        ranchers, loggers, miners, historic landscape, customs, national 
        parks, and architecture in the Heritage Area make the Heritage 
        Area unique.

    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to establish the 
Heritage Area to--
            (1) foster a close working relationship with all levels of 
        government, the private sector, residents, business interests, 
        and local communities in the State;
            (2) empower communities in the State to conserve, preserve, 
        and enhance the heritage of the communities while strengthening 
        future economic opportunities;
            (3) conserve, interpret, and develop the historical, 
        cultural, natural, and recreational resources within the 
        Heritage Area; and
            (4) expand, foster, and develop heritage businesses and 
        products relating to the cultural heritage of the Heritage Area.

Heritage Partnership Act of 2006''.

SEC. 282. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Champlain Valley and its extensive cultural and 
        natural resources have played a significant role in the history 
        of the United States and the individual States of Vermont and 
        New York;
            (2) archaeological evidence indicates that the Champlain 
        Valley has been inhabited by humans since the last retreat of 
        the glaciers, with the Native Americans living in the area at 
        the time of European discovery being primarily of Iroquois and 
        Algonquin descent;
            (3) the linked waterways of the Champlain Valley, including 
        the Richelieu River in Canada, played a unique and significant 
        role in the establishment and development of the United States 
        and Canada through several distinct eras, including--
                    (A) the era of European exploration, during which 
                Samuel de Champlain and other explorers used the 
                waterways as a means of access through the wilderness;
                    (B) the era of military campaigns, including highly 
                significant military campaigns of the French and Indian 
                War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812; and

[[Page 120 STAT. 1820]]

                    (C) the era of maritime commerce, during which canal 
                boats, schooners, and steamships formed the backbone of 
                commercial transportation for the region;
            (4) those unique and significant eras are best described by 
        the theme ``The Making of Nations and Corridors of Commerce'';
            (5) the artifacts and structures associated with those eras 
        are unusually well-preserved;
            (6) the Champlain Valley is recognized as having one of the 
        richest collections of historical resources in North America;
            (7) the history and cultural heritage of the Champlain 
        Valley are shared with Canada and the Province of Quebec;
            (8) there are benefits in celebrating and promoting this 
        mutual heritage;
            (9) tourism is among the most important industries in the 
        Champlain Valley, and heritage tourism in particular plays a 
        significant role in the economy of the Champlain Valley;
            (10) it is important to enhance heritage tourism in the 
        Champlain Valley while ensuring that increased visitation will 
        not impair the historical and cultural resources of the region;
            (11) according to the 1999 report of the National Park 
        Service entitled ``Champlain Valley Heritage Corridor Project'', 
        ``the Champlain Valley contains resources and represents a theme 
        `The Making of Nations and Corridors of Commerce', that is of 
        outstanding importance in United States history''; and
            (12) it is in the interest of the United States to preserve 
        and interpret the historical and cultural resources of the 
        Champlain Valley for the education and benefit of present and 
        future generations.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) to establish the Champlain Valley National Heritage 
        Partnership in the States of Vermont and New York to recognize 
        the importance of the historical, cultural, and recreational 
        resources of the Champlain Valley region to the United States;
            (2) to assist the States of Vermont and New York, including 
        units of local government and nongovernmental organizations in 
        the States, in preserving, protecting, and interpreting those 
        resources for the benefit of the people of the United States;
            (3) to use those resources and the theme ``the making of 
        nations and corridors of commerce'' to--
                    (A) revitalize the economy of communities in the 
                Champlain Valley; and
                    (B) generate and sustain increased levels of tourism 
                in the Champlain Valley;
            (4) to encourage--
                    (A) partnerships among State and local governments 
                and nongovernmental organizations in the United States; 
                and
                    (B) collaboration with Canada and the Province of 
                Quebec to--
                          (i) interpret and promote the history of the 
                      waterways of the Champlain Valley region;
                          (ii) form stronger bonds between the United 
                      States and Canada; and
                          (iii) promote the international aspects of the 
                      Champlain Valley region; and

[[Page 120 STAT. 1821]]

            (5) to provide financial and technical assistance for the 
        purposes described in paragraphs (1) through (4).

            (2) communities along the Great Basin Heritage Route 
        (including the towns of Delta, Utah, Ely, Nevada, and the 
        surrounding communities) are located in a classic western 
        landscape that contains long natural vistas, isolated high 
        desert

[[Page 120 STAT. 1825]]

        valleys, mountain ranges, ranches, mines, historic railroads, 
        archaeological sites, and tribal communities;
            (3) the Native American, pioneer, ranching, mining, timber, 
        and railroad heritages associated with the Great Basin Heritage 
        Route include the social history and living cultural traditions 
        of a rich diversity of nationalities;
            (4) the pioneer, Mormon, and other religious settlements, 
        and ranching, timber, and mining activities of the region played 
        and continue to play a significant role in the development of 
        the United States, shaped by--
                    (A) the unique geography of the Great Basin;
                    (B) an influx of people of Greek, Chinese, Basque, 
                Serb, Croat, Italian, and Hispanic descent; and
                    (C) a Native American presence (Western Shoshone, 
                Northern and Southern Paiute, and Goshute) that 
                continues in the Great Basin today;
            (5) the Great Basin housed internment camps for Japanese-
        American citizens during World War II, 1 of which, Topaz, was 
        located along the Heritage Route;
            (6) the pioneer heritage of the Heritage Route includes the 
        Pony Express route and stations, the Overland Stage, and many 
        examples of 19th century exploration of the western United 
        States;
            (7) the Native American heritage of the Heritage Route dates 
        back thousands of years and includes--
                    (A) archaeological sites;
                    (B) petroglyphs and pictographs;
                    (C) the westernmost village of the Fremont culture; 
                and
                    (D) communities of Western Shoshone, Paiute, and 
                Goshute tribes;
            (8) the Heritage Route contains multiple biologically 
        diverse ecological communities that are home to exceptional 
        species such as--
                    (A) bristlecone pines, the oldest living trees in 
                the world;
                    (B) wildlife adapted to harsh desert conditions;
                    (C) unique plant communities, lakes, and streams; 
                and
                    (D) native Bonneville cutthroat trout;
            (9) the air and water quality of the Heritage Route is among 
        the best in the United States, and the clear air permits 
        outstanding viewing of the night skies;
            (10) the Heritage Route includes unique and outstanding 
        geologic features such as numerous limestone caves, classic 
        basin and range topography with playa lakes, alluvial fans, 
        volcanics, cold and hot springs, and recognizable features of 
        ancient Lake Bonneville;
            (11) the Heritage Route includes an unusual variety of open 
        space and recreational and educational opportunities because of 
        the great quantity of ranching activity and public land 
        (including city, county, and State parks, national forests, 
        Bureau of Land Management land, and a national park);
            (12) there are significant archaeological, historical, 
        cultural, natural, scenic, and recreational resources in the 
        Great Basin to merit the involvement of the Federal Government 
        in the development, in cooperation with the Great Basin Heritage

[[Page 120 STAT. 1826]]

        of government, the private sector, and the local communities 
        within White Pine County, Nevada, Millard County, Utah, and the 
        Duckwater Shoshone Reservation;
            (2) to enable communities referred to in paragraph (1) to 
        conserve their heritage while continuing to develop economic 
        opportunities; and
            (3) to conserve, interpret, and develop the archaeological, 
        historical, cultural, natural, scenic, and recreational 
        resources related to the unique ranching, industrial, and

SEC. 297A. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during 
        the American Revolution because of the strategic location of the 
        State between the British armies headquartered in New York City, 
        New York, and the Continental Congress in the city of 
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
            (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the 
        period of the American Revolution personally commanding troops 
        of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, including 2 
        severe winters spent in encampments in the area that is now 
        Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of the National Park 
        System;
            (3) it was during the 10 crucial days of the American 
        Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, that 
        General Washington, after retreating across the State of New 
        Jersey from the State of New York to the Commonwealth of 
        Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the Delaware 
        River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on to win 
        crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State of New 
        Jersey;
            (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the 
        retreat, described the events during those days as ``the times 
        that try men's souls'';
            (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in the 
        State of New Jersey, including--
                    (A) several important battles of the American 
                Revolution that were significant to--
                          (i) the outcome of the American Revolution; 
                      and
                          (ii) the history of the United States; and
                    (B) several national historic landmarks, including 
                Washington's Crossing, the Old Trenton Barracks, and 
                Princeton, Monmouth, and Red Bank Battlefields;
            (6) additional national historic landmarks in the State of 
        New Jersey include the homes of--
                    (A) Richard Stockton, Joseph Hewes, John 
                Witherspoon, and Francis Hopkinson, signers of the 
                Declaration of Independence;
                    (B) Elias Boudinout, President of the Continental 
                Congress; and
                    (C) William Livingston, patriot and Governor of the 
                State of New Jersey from 1776 to 1790;
            (7) portions of the landscapes important to the strategies 
        of the British and Continental armies, including waterways, 
        mountains, farms, wetlands, villages, and roadways--
                    (A) retain the integrity of the period of the 
                American Revolution; and
                    (B) offer outstanding opportunities for 
                conservation, education, and recreation;
            (8) the National Register of Historic Places lists 251 
        buildings and sites in the National Park Service study area for 
        the Crossroads of the American Revolution that are associated 
        with the period of the American Revolution;
            (9) civilian populations residing in the State of New Jersey 
        during the American Revolution suffered extreme hardships 
        because of--
                    (A) the continuous conflict in the State;

[[Page 120 STAT. 1839]]

                    (B) foraging armies; and

                rebel sympathizers;
            (10) because of the important role that the State of New 
        Jersey played in the successful outcome of the American 
        Revolution, there is a Federal interest in developing a regional 
        framework to assist the State of New Jersey, local governments 
        and organizations, and private citizens in--
                    (A) preserving and protecting cultural, historic, 
                and natural resources of the period; and
                    (B) bringing recognition to those resources for the 
                educational and recreational benefit of the present and 
                future generations of citizens of the United States; and
            (11) the National Park Service has conducted a national 
        heritage area feasibility study in the State of New Jersey that 
        demonstrates that there is a sufficient assemblage of nationally 
        distinctive cultural, historic, and natural resources necessary 
        to establish the Crossroads of the American Revolution National 
        Heritage Area.

    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--

                States;
            (2) to foster a close working relationship among all levels 
        of government, the private sector, and local communities in the 
        State;
            (3) to provide for the management, preservation, protection, 
        and interpretation of the cultural, historic, and natural 
        resources of the State for the educational and inspirational 
        benefit of future generations;
            (4) to strengthen the value of Morristown National 
        Historical Park as an asset to the State by--

                TITLE III--NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDIES

       Subtitle A-- <<NOTE: Western Reserve Heritage Areas Study 
Act. Ohio.>> Western Reserve Heritage Area Study

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Western Reserve Heritage Areas 
Study Act''.

SEC. 302. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING THE WESTERN RESERVE, 
            OHIO.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The area that encompasses the modern-day counties of 
        Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, 
        Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa, and Ashland in Ohio 
        with the rich history in what was once the Western Reserve, has 
        made a unique contribution to the cultural, political, and 
        industrial development of the United States.
            (2) The Western Reserve is distinctive as the land settled 
        by the people of Connecticut after the Revolutionary War. The 
        Western Reserve holds a unique mark as the original wilderness 
        land of the West that many settlers migrated to in order to 
        begin life outside of the original 13 colonies.
            (3) The Western Reserve played a significant role in 
        providing land to the people of Connecticut whose property and 
        land was destroyed during the Revolution. These settlers were 
        descendants of the brave immigrants who came to the Americas in 
        the 17th century.
            (4) The Western Reserve offered a new destination for those 
        who moved west in search of land and prosperity. The 
        agricultural and industrial base that began in the Western 
        Reserve still lives strong in these prosperous and historical 
        counties.
            (5) The heritage of the Western Reserve remains transfixed 
        in the counties of Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, 
        Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, 
        Ottawa, and Ashland in Ohio. The people of these counties are 
        proud of their heritage as shown through the unwavering attempts 
        to preserve agricultural land and the industrial foundation that 
        has been embedded in this region since the

[[Page 120 STAT. 1846]]

        establishment of the Western Reserve. Throughout these counties, 
        historical sites, and markers preserve the unique traditions and 
        customs of its original heritage.
            (6) The counties that encompass the Western Reserve continue 
        to maintain a strong connection to its historic past as seen 
        through its preservation of its local heritage, including 
        historic homes, buildings, and centers of public gatherings.
            (7) There is a need for assistance for the preservation and 
        promotion of the significance of the Western Reserve as the 
        natural, historic and cultural heritage of the counties of 
        Trumbull, Mahoning, Ashtabula, Portage, Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, 
        Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, Ottawa and Ashland in Ohio.
            (8) The Department of the Interior is responsible for 
        protecting the Nation's cultural and historical resources. There 
        are significant examples of such resources within these counties 
        and what was once the Western Reserve to merit the involvement 
        of the Federal Government in the development of programs and 
        projects, in cooperation with the State of Ohio and other local 
        governmental entities, to adequately conserve, protect, and 
        interpret this heritage for future generations, while providing 
        opportunities for education and revitalization.

    (b) Study.--

        Geagua, Lake, Cuyahoga, Summit, Medina, Huron, Lorain, Erie, 
        Ottawa, and Ashland, and other appropriate organizations, shall 
        carry out a study regarding the suitability and feasibility of 
        establishing the Western Reserve Heritage Area in these counties 
        in Ohio.

        Delaware Valley who built fortifications for the protection of 
        settlers, such as Fort Christina;

        fortifications spaced along the river and bay from Fort Delaware 
        on Pea Patch Island to Fort Miles near Lewes;

        Delaware has played in the history of the Underground Railroad 
        network; and
            (8) the coastal environment, which would examine natural 
        resources of Delaware that provide resource-based recreational 
        opportunities such as crabbing, fishing, swimming, and boating.

SEC. 604. REPORT.

    Not later than 2 years after funds are made available to carry out
