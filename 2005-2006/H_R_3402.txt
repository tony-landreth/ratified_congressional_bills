 TITLE II--IMPROVING SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DATING 
                 VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND STALKING

SEC. 201. <<NOTE: 42 USC 13925 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nearly \1/3\ of American women report physical or sexual 
        abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.
            (2) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
        248,000 Americans 12 years of age and older were raped or 
        sexually assaulted in 2002.
            (3) Rape and sexual assault in the United States is 
        estimated to cost $127,000,000,000 per year, including--
                    (A) lost productivity;
                    (B) medical and mental health care;
                    (C) police and fire services;
                    (D) social services;
                    (E) loss of and damage to property; and
                    (F) reduced quality of life.
            (4) Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a 
        particular problem because of the high rate of nonstranger 
        sexual assault.
            (5) Geographic isolation often compounds the problems facing 
        sexual assault victims. The lack of anonymity and accessible 
        support services can limit opportunities for justice for 
        victims.
            (6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The 
        National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the perpetrator 
        was a family member in 90 percent of cases.
            (7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive relationships 
        include--
                    (A) the inability to support themselves;
                    (B) poor health that increases their dependence on 
                the abuser;
                    (C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and
                    (D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs 
                and law enforcement.
            (8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population 
        with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to be 
        the victims of abuse and violence than women without 
        disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, 
        social, or psychological dependence on others.
            (9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the 
        abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear being 
        abandoned or institutionalized.
            (10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed--

[[Page 119 STAT. 2994]]

                    (A) only 35 percent of these programs offered 
                disability awareness training for their staff; and
                    (B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to 
                provide services to women with disabilities.
            (11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for 
        immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their 
        family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file 
        immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children as 
        powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from seeking 
        help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent homes because 
        of fear of deportation.
            (12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive 
        relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or 
        bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or 
        financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a 
        certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the 
        police or a 9-1-1 operator, or even in acquiring information 
        about their rights and the legal system.
            (13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic 
        Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and 
        confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.
            (14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is 
        available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with 
        bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a 
        TTY line for the hearing-impaired.
            (15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service 
        providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United 
        States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline 
        provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers 
        with sources of help in their local community.
            (16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that 
        calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a domestic 
        violence situation and that they have not called the police or 
        any other support services.
            (17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase 
        in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
            (18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National 
        Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, 
        and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically increase 
        the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly and 
        effectively.

   TITLE III--SERVICES, PROTECTION, AND JUSTICE FOR YOUNG VICTIMS OF 
                                VIOLENCE

SEC. 301. <<NOTE: 42 USC 13925 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Youth, under the age of 18, account for 67 percent of 
        all sexual assault victimizations reported to law enforcement 
        officials.
            (2) The Department of Justice consistently finds that young 
        women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate 
        of non-fatal intimate partner violence.
            (3) In 1 year, over 4,000 incidents of rape or sexual 
        assault occurred in public schools across the country.
            (4) Young people experience particular obstacles to seeking 
        help. They often do not have access to money, transportation, or 
        shelter services. They must overcome issues such as distrust of 
        adults, lack of knowledge about available resources, or pressure 
        from peers and parents.
            (5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the 
        State of California, funded by the California Department of 
        Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and 
        confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers to 
        young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking help.
            (6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to 
        petition the court for protection orders.
            (7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and 
        these relationships can include the same kind of domestic 
        violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In 
        fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic violence 
        involve people who are not married.
            (8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone 
        their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, and 13 
        percent of college women report being stalked.
            (9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of 
        rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 
        percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened rapes 
        took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the completed rapes 
        that occurred on campus took place in the victim's residence.
            (10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 
        Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 percent 
        of the general male university population, but they accounted 
        for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual assault and 
        35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.

SEC. 302. RAPE PREVENTION AND EDUCATION.

    Section 393B(c) of part J of title III of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 280b-1c(c)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--
            ``(1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to 
        carry out this section $80,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 
        through 2011.
            ``(2) National sexual violence resource center allotment.--
        Of the total amount made available under this subsection in each 
        fiscal year, not less than $1,500,000 shall be available for 
        allotment under subsection (b).''.

    TITLE IV--STRENGTHENING AMERICA'S FAMILIES BY PREVENTING VIOLENCE

SEC. 401. PREVENTING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

    The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (108 Stat. 1902 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

 ``Subtitle M--Strengthening America's Families by Preventing Violence 
                       Against Women and Children

``SEC. 41301. <<NOTE: 42 USC 14043d.>> FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds that--

[[Page 119 STAT. 3018]]

            ``(1) the former United States Advisory Board on Child Abuse 
        suggests that domestic violence may be the single major 
        precursor to child abuse and neglect fatalities in this country;
            ``(2) studies suggest that as many as 10,000,000 children 
        witness domestic violence every year;
            ``(3) studies suggest that among children and teenagers, 
        recent exposure to violence in the home was a significant factor 
        in predicting a child's violent behavior;
            ``(4) a study by the Nurse-Family Partnership found that 
        children whose parents did not participate in home visitation 
        programs that provided coaching in parenting skills, advice and 
        support, were almost 5 times more likely to be abused in their 
        first 2 years of life;
            ``(5) a child's exposure to domestic violence seems to pose 
        the greatest independent risk for being the victim of any act of 
        partner violence as an adult;
            ``(6) children exposed to domestic violence are more likely 
        to believe that using violence is an effective means of getting 
        one's needs met and managing conflict in close relationships;
            ``(7) children exposed to abusive parenting, harsh or 
        erratic discipline, or domestic violence are at increased risk 
        for juvenile crime; and
            ``(8) in a national survey of more than 6,000 American 
        families, 50 percent of men who frequently assaulted their wives 
        also frequently abused their children.

``SEC. 41302. <<NOTE: 42 USC 14043d-1.>> PURPOSE.

    ``The purpose of this subtitle is to--
            ``(1) prevent crimes involving violence against women, 
        children, and youth;
            ``(2) increase the resources and services available to 
        prevent violence against women, children, and youth;
            ``(3) reduce the impact of exposure to violence in the lives 
        of children and youth so that the intergenerational cycle of 
        violence is interrupted;
            ``(4) develop and implement education and services programs 
        to prevent children in vulnerable families from becoming victims 
        or perpetrators of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
        assault, or stalking;
            ``(5) promote programs to ensure that children and youth 
        receive the assistance they need to end the cycle of violence 
        and develop mutually respectful, nonviolent relationships; and
            ``(6) encourage collaboration among community-based 
        organizations and governmental agencies serving children and 
        youth, providers of health and mental health services and 
        providers of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,

  TITLE V--STRENGTHENING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM'S RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC 
         VIOLENCE, DATING VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND STALKING

SEC. 501. <<NOTE: 42 USC 280g-4 note.>> FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence in 
        the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.
            (2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in 
        hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were 
        injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.

[[Page 119 STAT. 3024]]

            (3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent 
        episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a number 
        of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women who have 
        been abused are much more likely to suffer from chronic pain, 
        diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, substance abuse 
        and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.
            (4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on 
        abused women than on general enrollees.
            (5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United 
        States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering 
        leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight gain, 
        anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding.
            (6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to 
        be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-
        related cause, and evidence exists that a significant proportion 
        of all female homicide victims are killed by their intimate 
        partners.
            (7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely 
        to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including 
        depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also 
        more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run 
        away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit 
        sexual assault crimes.
            (8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing 
        domestic violence significantly increase their safety-promoting 
        behaviors over the short- and long-term when health care 
        providers screen for, identify, and provide followup care and 
        information to address the violence.
            (9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care 
        physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during 
        new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for intimate 
        partner abuse during periodic checkups.
            (10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness 
        of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of pregnant 
        women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a 10-minute 
        intervention that was proven highly effective in increasing the 
        safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable research does not 
        yet exist to support the effectiveness of screening men.
            (11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported 
        that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them 
        privately about intimate partner violence.

SEC. 502. <<NOTE: 42 USC 280g-4 note.>> PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this title to improve the health care system's 
response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking through the training and education of health care providers, 
developing comprehensive public health responses to violence against 
women and children, increasing the number of women properly screened, 
identified, and treated for lifetime exposure to violence, and expanding 
research on effective interventions in the health care setting.

   TITLE VI--HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND SAFETY FOR BATTERED WOMEN AND 
                                CHILDREN

SEC. 601. ADDRESSING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
            DATING VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND STALKING.

    The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13701 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

   ``Subtitle N--Addressing the Housing Needs of Victims of Domestic 
         Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking

``SEC. 41401. <<NOTE: 42 USC 14043e.>> FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds that:
            ``(1) There is a strong link between domestic violence and 
        homelessness. Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified 
        domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.
            ``(2) Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced 
        severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of 
        all homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by 
        age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner 
        violence as adults.
            ``(3) Women and families across the country are being 
        discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted from 
        public and subsidized housing because of their status as victims 
        of domestic violence.
            ``(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around the 
        country found that these providers have responded to almost 150 
        documented eviction cases in the last year alone where the 
        tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence crimes 
        committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients were 
        denied housing because of their status as victims of domestic 
        violence.
            ``(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack adequate 
        emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate emergency 
        options for victims presents a serious threat to their safety 
        and the safety of their children. Requests for emergency shelter 
        by homeless women with children increased by 78 percent of 
        United States cities surveyed in 2004. In the same year, 32 
        percent of the requests for shelter by homeless families went 
        unmet due to the lack of available emergency shelter beds.
            ``(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, 
        while the average length of time it takes a homeless family to 
        secure housing is 6 to 10 months.
            ``(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive 
        partners because they cannot find long-term housing.
            ``(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers 
        available to accommodate the number of people in need of

[[Page 119 STAT. 3031]]

        long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for 
        Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are 
        closed.
            ``(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide an 
        essential continuum between emergency shelter provision and 
        independent living. A majority of women in transitional housing 
        programs stated that had these programs not existed, they would 
        have likely gone back to abusive partners.
            ``(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in an 
        effort to control their partners, victims often lack steady 
        income, credit history, landlord references, and a current 
        address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-term 
        permanent housing.
            ``(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face 
        additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, such 
        as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public 
        transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, 
        under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty ensuring 
        confidentiality in small communities, and decreased access to 
        many resources (such as advanced education, job opportunities, 
        and adequate childcare).
            ``(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development have recognized in recent years that families 
        experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should be 
        addressed by those administering the Federal housing programs.

``SEC. 41402. <<NOTE: 42 USC 14043e-1.>> PURPOSE.

    ``The purpose of this subtitle is to reduce domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and to prevent 
homelessness by--
            ``(1) protecting the safety of victims of domestic violence, 
        dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking who reside in 
        homeless shelters, public housing, assisted housing, tribally 
        designated housing, or other emergency, transitional, permanent, 
        or affordable housing, and ensuring that such victims have 
        meaningful access to the criminal justice system without 
        jeopardizing such housing;
            ``(2) creating long-term housing solutions that develop 
        communities and provide sustainable living solutions for victims 
        of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and 
        stalking;
            ``(3) building collaborations among victim service 
        providers, homeless service providers, housing providers, and 
        housing agencies to provide appropriate services, interventions, 
        and training to address the housing needs of victims of domestic 
        violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; and
            ``(4) enabling public and assisted housing agencies, 
        tribally designated housing entities, private landlords, 
        property management companies, and other housing providers and 
        agencies to respond appropriately to domestic violence, dating 
        violence, sexual assault, and stalking, while maintaining a safe 
        environment for all housing residents.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) 1 out of every 3 Indian (including Alaska Native) women 
        are raped in their lifetimes;
            (2) Indian women experience 7 sexual assaults per 1,000, 
        compared with 4 per 1,000 among Black Americans, 3 per 1,000 
        among Caucasians, 2 per 1,000 among Hispanic women, and 1 per 
        1,000 among Asian women;
            (3) Indian women experience the violent crime of battering 
        at a rate of 23.2 per 1,000, compared with 8 per 1,000 among 
        Caucasian women;
            (4) during the period 1979 through 1992, homicide was the 
        third leading cause of death of Indian females aged 15

[[Page 119 STAT. 3078]]

        to 34, and 75 percent were killed by family members or 
        acquaintances;
            (5) Indian tribes require additional criminal justice and 
        victim services resources to respond to violent assaults against 
        women; and
            (6) the unique legal relationship of the United States to 
        Indian tribes creates a Federal trust responsibility to assist
