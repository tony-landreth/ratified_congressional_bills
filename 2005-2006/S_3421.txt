SEC. 207. <<NOTE: 38 USC 3104 note.>> BLIND REHABILITATION OUTPATIENT 
            SPECIALISTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There are approximately 135,000 blind veterans 
        throughout the United States, including approximately 35,000 who 
        are enrolled with the Department of Veterans Affairs. An aging 
        veteran population and injuries incurred in Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom are increasing the number 
        of blind veterans.

[[Page 120 STAT. 3413]]

            (2) Since 1996, when the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        hired its first 14 blind rehabilitation outpatient specialists 
        (referred to in this section as ``Specialists''), Specialists 
        have been a critical part of the continuum of care for blind and 
        visually impaired veterans.
            (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs operates 10 
        residential blind rehabilitation centers that are considered 
        among the best in the world. These centers have had long waiting 
        lists, with as many as 1,500 blind veterans waiting for openings 
        in 2004.
            (4) Specialists provide--
                    (A) critically needed services to veterans who are 
                unable to attend residential centers or are waiting to 
                enter a residential center program;
                    (B) a range of services for blind veterans, 
                including training with living skills, mobility, and 
                adaptation of manual skills; and
                    (C) pre-admission screening and follow-up care for 
                blind rehabilitation centers.
            (5) There are not enough Specialist positions to meet the 
        increased numbers and needs of blind veterans.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Establishment of Additional Specialist 
Positions.--Not later than 30 months after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall establish an 
additional Specialist position at not fewer than 35 additional 
facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

    (c) Selection of Facilities.--In identifying the most appropriate 
facilities to receive a Specialist position under this section, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) give priority to facilities with large numbers of 
        enrolled legally blind veterans;
            (2) ensure that each facility does not have such a position; 
        and
            (3) ensure that each facility is in need of the services of 
        a Specialist.

    (d) Coordination.--The Secretary shall coordinate the provision of 
blind rehabilitation services for veterans with services for the care of 
the visually impaired offered by State and local agencies, especially to 
the extent to which such State and local agencies can provide necessary 
services to blind veterans in settings located closer to the residences 
of such veterans at similar quality and cost to the veteran.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs to carry out this 
section $3,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2012.

        participation in Department contracts (including subcontracts) 
        by small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans who 
        are not

[[Page 120 STAT. 3432]]

year for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled 
by veterans with service-connected disabilities under section 15(g)(1) 
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1)).
    ``(4) <<NOTE: Review.>> The Secretary shall establish a review 
mechanism to ensure that, in the case of a subcontract of a Department 
contract that is counted for purposes of meeting a goal established 
pursuant to this section, the subcontract was actually awarded to a 
business concern that may be counted for purposes of meeting that goal.

    ``(b) Use of Noncompetitive Procedures for Certain Small 
Contracts.--For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and 
in accordance with this section, in entering into a contract with a 
small business concern owned and controlled by veterans for an amount 
less than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 
of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)), a 
contracting officer of the Department may use procedures other than 
competitive procedures.
    ``(c) Sole Source Contracts for Contracts Above Simplified 
Acquisition Threshold.--For purposes of meeting the goals under 
subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting 
officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business 
concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than 
competitive procedures if--

        with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
            ``(2) the anticipated award price of the contract (including 
        options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as 
        defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
        Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and

        offers best value to the United States.

    ``(d) Use of Restricted Competition.--Except as provided in 
subsections (b) and (c), for purposes of meeting the goals under 
subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting 
officer of the Department shall award contracts on the basis of 
competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled 
by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that 
two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans 
will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and 
reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.
    ``(e) Eligibility of Small Business Concerns.--A small business 
concern may be awarded a contract under this section only if the small 
business concern and the veteran owner of the small business concern are 
listed in the database of veteran-owned businesses maintained by the 
Secretary under subsection (f).

shall submit to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may 
require with respect to the small business concern or the veteran.
    ``(3) Information maintained in the database shall be submitted on a 
voluntary basis by such veterans.
    ``(4) In maintaining the database, the Secretary shall carry out at 
least the following two verification functions:

        in the database is owned and controlled by veterans.
            ``(B) In the case of a veteran who indicates a service-
        connected disability, verification of the service-disabled 
        status of such veteran.

    ``(5) <<NOTE: Notification.>> The Secretary shall make the database 
available to all Federal departments and agencies and shall notify each 
such department and agency of the availability of the database.

    ``(6) If the Secretary determines that the public dissemination of 
certain types of information maintained in the database is 
inappropriate, the Secretary shall take such steps as are necessary to 
maintain such types of information in a secure and confidential manner.
    ``(g) Enforcement Penalties for Misrepresentation.--Any business 
concern that is determined by the Secretary to have misrepresented the 
status of that concern as a small business concern owned and controlled 
by veterans or as a small business concern owned and controlled by 
service-disabled veterans for purposes of this subsection shall be 
debarred from contracting with the Department for a reasonable period of 
time, as determined by the Secretary.
    ``(h) Treatment of Businesses After Death of Veteran-Owner.--(1) 
Subject to paragraph (3), if the death of a veteran causes a small 
business concern to be less than 51 percent owned by one or more 
veterans, the surviving spouse of such veteran who acquires ownership 
rights in such small business concern shall, for the period described in 
paragraph (2), be treated as if the surviving spouse were that veteran 
for the purpose of maintaining the status of the small business concern 
as a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans.
    ``(2) The period referred to in paragraph (1) is the period 
beginning on the date on which the veteran dies and ending on the 
earliest of the following dates:
            ``(A) The date on which the surviving spouse remarries.
            ``(B) The date on which the surviving spouse relinquishes an 
        ownership interest in the small business concern.
            ``(C) The date that is ten years after the date of the 
        veteran's death.

    ``(3) Paragraph (1) only applies to a surviving spouse of a veteran 
with a service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling or 
who dies as a result of a service-connected disability.
    ``(i) <<NOTE: Applicability.>> Priority for Contracting 
Preferences.--Preferences for awarding contracts to small business 
concerns shall be applied in the following order of priority:

            END HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS.

    (a) Reaffirmation.--Congress reaffirms the national goal to end 
chronic homelessness among veterans within a decade of the enactment of 
the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 (Public Law 
107-95; 115 Stat. 903).

reaffirms its encouragement, as specified in the Homeless Veterans 
Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-95; 115 Stat. 903), 
that all departments and agencies of the Federal, State, and local 
governments, quasi-governmental organizations, private and public sector 
entities, including community-based organizations, faith-based 
organizations, and individuals, work cooperatively to end chronic 
homelessness among veterans.

SEC. 702. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE RESPONSE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) homelessness is a significant problem in the veterans 
        community and veterans are disproportionately represented among 
        the homeless population;
            (2) while many effective programs assist homeless veterans 
        to become, once again, productive and self-sufficient members of 
        their communities and society, all the essential services, 
        assistance, and support that homeless veterans require are not 
        currently provided;
            (3) federally funded programs for homeless veterans should 
        be held accountable for achieving clearly defined results;
            (4) Federal efforts to assist homeless veterans should 
        include prevention of homelessness;
            (5) Federal efforts regarding homeless veterans should be 
        particularly vigorous where women veterans have minor children 
        in their care;

[[Page 120 STAT. 3440]]

            (6) Federal agencies, particularly the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs, the Department of Labor, and the Department of 
        Housing and Urban Development, should cooperate more fully to 
        address the problem of homelessness among veterans; and
            (7) the programs reauthorized by this title provide 
        important housing and services to homeless veterans.
