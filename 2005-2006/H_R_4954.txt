  ``SUBCHAPTER IV--PROHIBITION ON FUNDING OF UNLAWFUL INTERNET GAMBLING

``Sec. 5361. Congressional findings and purpose

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal 
        use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire 
        transfers.
            ``(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 
        recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire 
        transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which 
        represent such sites.
            ``(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt 
        collection problems for insured depository institutions and the 
        consumer credit industry.
            ``(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the 
        Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement 
        mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling
