            INFORMATION PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--

[[Page 119 STAT. 1197]]

            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a real-time 
        system management information program to provide, in all States, 
        the capability to monitor, in real-time, the traffic and travel 
        conditions of the major highways of the United States and to 
        share that information to improve the security of the surface 
        transportation system, to address congestion problems, to 
        support improved response to weather events and surface 
        transportation incidents, and to facilitate national and 
        regional highway traveler information.

        management information program are to--
                    (A) establish, in all States, a system of basic 
                real-time information for managing and operating the 
                surface transportation system;
                    (B) identify longer range real-time highway and 
                transit monitoring needs and develop plans and 
                strategies for meeting such needs; and
                    (C) provide the capability and means to share that 
                data with State and local governments and the traveling 
                public.

    (b) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Data Exchange Formats.--Not later than 2 
years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
establish data exchange formats to ensure that the data provided by 
highway and transit monitoring systems, including statewide incident 
reporting systems, can readily be exchanged across jurisdictional 
boundaries, facilitating nationwide availability of information.

    (c) Regional Intelligent Transportation System Architecture.--
            (1) Addressing information needs.--As State and local 
        governments develop or update regional intelligent 
        transportation system architectures, described in section 940.9 
        of title 23, Code of Federal Regulations, such governments shall 
        explicitly address real-time highway and transit information 
        needs and the systems needed to meet such needs, including 
        addressing coverage, monitoring systems, data fusion and 
        archiving, and methods of exchanging or sharing highway and 
        transit information.
            (2) Data exchange.--States shall incorporate the data 
        exchange formats established by the Secretary under subsection 
        (b) to ensure that the data provided by highway and transit 
        monitoring systems may readily be exchanged with State and local 
        governments and may be made available to the traveling public.

    (d) Eligibility.--Subject to project approval by the Secretary, a 
State may obligate funds apportioned to the State under sections 
104(b)(1), 104(b)(2), and 104(b)(3) of title 23, United States Code, for 
activities relating to the planning and deployment of real-time 
monitoring elements that advance the goals and purposes described in 
subsection (a).
    (e) Limitation on Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section 
shall be construed as altering or otherwise affecting the applicability 
of the requirements of chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code 
(including requirements relating to the eligibility of a project for 
assistance under the program, the location of the project, and the 
Federal-share payable on account of the project), to amounts apportioned 
to a State for a program under section

104(b) that are obligated by the State for activities and projects under 
this section.
    (f) Statewide Incident Reporting System Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``statewide incident reporting system'' means a statewide 
system for facilitating the real-time electronic reporting of surface 
transportation incidents to a central location for use in monitoring the 
event, providing accurate traveler information, and responding to the 
incident as appropriate.

                   Subtitle C--Mobility and Efficiency

SEC. 1301. <<NOTE: 23 USC 101 note.>> PROJECTS OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL 
            SIGNIFICANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Under current law, surface transportation programs rely 
        primarily on formula capital apportionments to States.
            (2) Despite the significant increase for surface 
        transportation program funding in the Transportation Equity Act 
        of the 21st Century, current levels of investment are 
        insufficient to fund critical high-cost transportation 
        infrastructure facilities that address critical national 
        economic and transportation needs.
            (3) Critical high-cost transportation infrastructure 
        facilities often include multiple levels of government, 
        agencies, modes of transportation, and transportation goals and 
        planning processes that are not easily addressed or funded 
        within existing surface transportation program categories.
            (4) Projects of national and regional significance have 
        national and regional benefits, including improving economic 
        productivity by facilitating international trade, relieving 
        congestion, and improving transportation safety by facilitating 
        passenger and freight movement.
            (5) The benefits of projects described in paragraph (4) 
        accrue to local areas, States, and the Nation as a result of the 
        effect such projects have on the national transportation system.
            (6) A program dedicated to constructing projects of national 
        and regional significance is necessary to improve the safe, 
        secure, and efficient movement of people and goods throughout 
        the United States and improve the health and welfare of the 
        national economy.

    (b) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary shall establish a 
program to provide grants to States for projects of national and 
regional significance.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Eligible project costs.--The term ``eligible project 
        costs'' means the costs of--
                    (A) development phase activities, including

                environmental review, preliminary engineering and design 
                work, and other preconstruction activities; and
                    (B) construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, 
                and acquisition of real property (including land related 
                to the project and improvements to land), environmental 
                mitigation, construction contingencies, acquisition of

                subsection (d);
                    (B) conduct a national solicitation for 
                applications; and
                    (C) award grants on a competitive basis.
            (2) Criteria for grants.--The Secretary may approve a grant 
        under this section for a project only if the Secretary 
        determines that the project--
                    (A) is based on the results of preliminary 
                engineering;
                    (B) is justified based on the ability of the 
                project--
                          (i) to generate national economic benefits, 
                      including creating jobs, expanding business 
                      opportunities, and impacting the gross domestic 
                      product;
                          (ii) to reduce congestion, including impacts 
                      in the State, region, and Nation;
                          (iii) to improve transportation safety, 
                      including reducing transportation accidents, 
                      injuries, and fatalities;
                          (iv) to otherwise enhance the national 
                      transportation system; and
                          (v) to garner support for non-Federal 
                      financial commitments and provide evidence of 
                      stable and dependable financing sources to 
                      construct, maintain, and operate the 
                      infrastructure facility; and
                    (C) is supported by an acceptable degree of non-
                Federal financial commitments, including evidence of 
                stable and dependable financing sources to construct, 
                maintain, and operate the infrastructure facility.
            (3) Selection considerations.--In selecting a project under 
        this section, the Secretary shall consider the extent to which 
        the project--
                    (A) leverages Federal investment by encouraging non-
                Federal contributions to the project, including 
                contributions from public-private partnerships;
                    (B) uses new technologies, including intelligent 
                transportation systems, that enhance the efficiency of 
                the project; and
                    (C) helps maintain or protect the environment.

[[Page 119 STAT. 1200]]

            (4) Preliminary engineering.--In evaluating a project under 
        paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall analyze and consider the 
        results of preliminary engineering for the project.
            (5) Non-federal financial commitment.--
                    (A) Evaluation of project.--In evaluating a project 
                under paragraph (2)(C), the Secretary shall require 
                that--
                          (i) the proposed project plan provides for the 
                      availability of contingency amounts that the 
                      Secretary determines to be reasonable to cover 
                      unanticipated cost increases; and
                          (ii) each proposed non-Federal source of 
                      capital and operating financing is stable, 
                      reliable, and available within the proposed 
                      project timetable.
                    (B) Considerations.--In assessing the stability, 
                reliability, and availability of proposed sources of 
                non-Federal financing under subparagraph (A), the 
                Secretary shall consider--
                          (i) existing financial commitments;
                          (ii) the degree to which financing sources are 
                      dedicated to the purposes proposed;
                          (iii) any debt obligation that exists or is 
                      proposed by the recipient for the proposed 
                      project; and
                          (iv) the extent to which the project has a 
                      non-Federal financial commitment that exceeds the 
                      required non-Federal share of the cost of the 
                      project.
            (6) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Regulations.--Not later than 180 
        days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
        shall issue regulations on the manner in which the Secretary 
        will evaluate and rate the projects based on the results of 
        preliminary engineering, project justification, and the degree 
        of non-Federal financial commitment, as required under this 
        subsection.
            (7) Project evaluation and rating.--
                    (A) In general.--A proposed project may advance from 
                preliminary engineering to final design and construction 
                only if the Secretary finds that the project meets the 
                requirements of this subsection and there is a 
                reasonable likelihood that the project will continue to 
                meet such requirements.
                    (B) Evaluation and rating.--In making such findings, 
                the Secretary shall evaluate and rate the project as 
                ``highly recommended'', ``recommended'', or ``not 
                recommended'' based on the results of preliminary 
                engineering, the project justification criteria, and the 
                degree of non-Federal financial commitment, as required 
                under this subsection. In rating the projects, the 
                Secretary shall provide, in addition to the overall 
                project rating, individual ratings for each of the 
                criteria established under the regulations issued under 
                paragraph (6).

    (g) Letters of Intent and Full Funding Grant Agreements.--
            (1) Letter of intent.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary may issue a letter of 
                intent to an applicant announcing an intention to 
                obligate, for a project under this section, an amount 
                from future available budget authority specified in law 
                that is not more than the amount stipulated as the 
                financial participation of the Secretary in the project.

[[Page 119 STAT. 1201]]

                    (B) <<NOTE: Deadline.>> Notification.--At least 60 
                days before issuing a letter under subparagraph (A) or 
                entering into a full funding grant agreement, the 
                Secretary shall notify in writing the Committee on 
                Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
                Representatives and the Committee on Environment and 
                Public Works of the Senate of the proposed letter or 
                agreement. <<NOTE: Records.>> The Secretary shall 
                include with the notification a copy of the proposed 
                letter or agreement as well as the evaluations and 
                ratings for the project.
                    (C) Not an obligation.--The issuance of a letter is 
                deemed not to be an obligation under sections 1108(c), 
                1108(d), 1501, and 1502(a) of title 31, United States 
                Code, or an administrative commitment.
                    (D) Obligation or commitment.--An obligation or 
                administrative commitment may be made only when contract 
                authority is allocated to a project.
            (2) Full funding grant agreement.--
                    (A) In general.--A project financed under this 
                subsection shall be carried out through a full funding 
                grant agreement. The Secretary shall enter into a full 
                funding grant agreement based on the evaluations and 
                ratings required under subsection (f)(7).
                    (B) Terms.--If the Secretary makes a full funding 
                grant agreement with an applicant, the agreement shall--
                          (i) establish the terms of participation by 
                      the United States Government in a project under 
                      this section;
                          (ii) establish the maximum amount of 
                      Government financial assistance for the project;
                          (iii) cover the period of time for completing 
                      the project, including a period extending beyond 
                      the period of an authorization; and
                          (iv) make timely and efficient management of 
                      the project easier according to the laws of the 
                      United States.
                    (C) Agreement.--An agreement under this paragraph 
                obligates an amount of available budget authority 
                specified in law and may include a commitment, 
                contingent on amounts to be specified in law in advance 
                for commitments under this paragraph, to obligate an 
                additional amount from future available budget authority 
                specified in law. The agreement shall state that the 
                contingent commitment is not an obligation of the 
                Government. Interest and other financing costs of 
                efficiently carrying out a part of the project within a 
                reasonable time are a cost of carrying out the project 
                under a full funding grant agreement, except that 
                eligible costs may not be more than the cost of the most 
                favorable financing terms reasonably available for the 
                project at the time of borrowing. The applicant shall 
                certify, in a way satisfactory to the Secretary, that 
                the applicant has shown reasonable diligence in seeking 
                the most favorable financing terms.
            (3) Amounts.--The total estimated amount of future 
        obligations of the Government and contingent commitments to 
        incur obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent 
        and full funding grant agreements may be not more than the 
        greater of the amount authorized to carry out this section or an 
        amount

[[Page 119 STAT. 1202]]

        equivalent to the last 2 fiscal years of funding authorized to 
        carry out this section less an amount the Secretary reasonably 
        estimates is necessary for grants under this section not covered 
        by a letter. The total amount covered by new letters and 
        contingent commitments included in full funding grant agreements 
        may be not more than a limitation specified in law.

    (h) Grant Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--A grant for a project under this section 
        shall be subject to all of the requirements of title 23, United 
        States Code.
            (2) Other terms and conditions.--The Secretary shall require 
        that all grants under this section be subject to all terms, 
        conditions, and requirements that the Secretary decides are 
        necessary or appropriate for purposes of this section, including 
        requirements for the disposition of net increases in value of 
        real property resulting from the project assisted under this 
        section.

    (i) Government's Share of Project Cost.--Based on engineering 
studies, studies of economic feasibility, and information on the 
expected use of equipment or facilities, the Secretary shall estimate 
the cost of a project receiving assistance under this section. A grant 
for the project is for 80 percent of the project cost, unless the grant 
recipient requests a lower grant percentage. A refund or reduction of 
the remainder may be made only if a refund of a proportional amount of 
the grant of the Government is made at the same time.
    (j) Fiscal Capacity Considerations.--If the Secretary gives priority 
consideration to financing projects that include more than the non-
Government share required under subsection (i) the Secretary shall give 
equal consideration to differences in the fiscal capacity of State and 
local governments.
    (k) Reports.--
            (1) Annual report.--Not later than the first Monday in 
        February of each year, the Secretary shall submit to the 
        Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public 
        Works of the Senate a report that includes a proposal on the 
        allocation of amounts to be made available to finance grants 
        under this section.
            (2) Recommendations on funding.--The annual report under 
        this paragraph shall include evaluations and ratings, as 
        required under subsection (f). The report shall also include 
        recommendations of projects for funding based on the evaluations 
        and ratings and on existing commitments and anticipated funding 
        levels for the next 3 fiscal years and for the next 10 fiscal 
        years based on information currently available to the Secretary.

    (l) Applicability of Title 23.--Funds made available to carry out 
this section shall be available for obligation in the same manner as if 
such funds were apportioned under chapter 1 of title 23, United States 
Code; except that such funds shall not be transferable and shall remain 
available until expended and the Federal share of the cost of a project 
under this section shall be as provided in this section.
    (m) Designated Projects.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this section, the Secretary shall allocate for each of fiscal

[[Page 119 STAT. 1203]]

years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, from funds made available to 
carry out this section, 10 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 25 percent, 
and 20 percent respectively, of the following amounts for grants to 
carry out the following projects under this section:

SEC. 1302. <<NOTE: 23 USC 101 note.>> NATIONAL CORRIDOR INFRASTRUCTURE 
            IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish and implement a 
program to make allocations to States for highway construction projects 
in corridors of national significance to promote economic growth and 
international or interregional trade pursuant to the selection factors 
provided in this section. A State must submit an application to the 
Secretary in order to receive an allocation under this section.
    (b) Selection Process.--
            (1) Priority.--In the selection process under this section, 
        the Secretary shall give priority to projects in corridors that 
        are a part of, or will be designated as part of, the Dwight D. 
        Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways 
        after completion of the work described in the application 
        received by the Secretary and to any project that will be 
        completed within 5 years of the date of the allocation of funds 
        for the project.
            (2) Selection factors.--In making allocations under this 
        section, the Secretary shall consider the following factors:
                    (A) The extent to which the corridor provides a link 
                between two existing segments of the Interstate System.
                    (B) The extent to which the project will facilitate 
                major multistate or regional mobility and economic 
                growth and development in areas underserved by existing 
                highway infrastructure.
                    (C) The extent to which commercial vehicle traffic 
                in the corridor--
                          (i) has increased since the date of enactment 
                      of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
                      Implementation Act (16 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.); and
                          (ii) is projected to increase in the future.
                    (D) The extent to which international truck-borne 
                commodities move through the corridor.

[[Page 119 STAT. 1205]]

                    (E) The extent to which the project will make 
                improvements to an existing segment of the Interstate 
                System that will result in a decrease in congestion.
                    (F) The reduction in commercial and other travel 
                time through a major freight corridor expected as a 
                result of the project.
                    (G) The value of the cargo carried by commercial 
                vehicle traffic in the corridor and the economic costs 
                arising from congestion in the corridor.
                    (H) The extent of leveraging of Federal funds 
                provided to carry out this section, including--
                          (i) use of innovative financing;
                          (ii) combination with funding provided under 
                      other sections of this Act and title 23, United 
                      States Code; and
                          (iii) combination with other sources of 
                      Federal, State, local, or private funding.

    (c) Applicability of Title 23.--Funds made available by section 
1101(a)(10) of this Act to carry out this section shall be available for 
obligation in the same manner as if such funds were apportioned under 
chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code; except that such funds shall 
remain available until expended, and the Federal share of the cost of a 
project under this section shall be determined in accordance with 
section 120 of such title.
    (d) State Defined.--In this section, the term ``State'' has the 
meaning such term has in section 101(a) of title 23, United States Code.
    (e) Designated Projects.--The Secretary shall allocate for each of 
fiscal years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, from funds made available 
to carry out this section, 10 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 25

    (c) <<NOTE: 23 USC 129 note.>> Interstate System Construction Toll 
Pilot Program.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish and 
        implement an Interstate System construction toll pilot program 
        under which the Secretary, notwithstanding sections 129 and 301 
        of title 23, United States Code, may permit a State or an 
        interstate compact of States to collect tolls on a highway, 
        bridge, or tunnel on the Interstate System for the purpose of 
        constructing Interstate highways.
            (2) Limitation on number of facilities.--The Secretary may 
        permit the collection of tolls under this section on three 
        facilities on the Interstate System.
            (3) Eligibility.--To be eligible to participate in the pilot 
        program, a State shall submit to the Secretary an application 
        that contains, at a minimum, the following:
                    (A) An identification of the facility on the 
                Interstate System proposed to be a toll facility.
                    (B) In the case of a facility that affects a 
                metropolitan area, an assurance that the metropolitan 
                planning organization designated under section 134 or 
                135 for the area has been consulted concerning the 
                placement and amount of tolls on the facility.
                    (C) An analysis demonstrating that financing the 
                construction of the facility with the collection of 
                tolls under the pilot program is the most efficient and 
                economical way to advance the project.
                    (D) A facility management plan that includes--
                          (i) a plan for implementing the imposition of 
                      tolls on the facility;
                          (ii) a schedule and finance plan for the 
                      construction of the facility using toll revenues;
                          (iii) a description of the public 
                      transportation agency that will be responsible for 
                      implementation and administration of the pilot 
                      program;
                          (iv) a description of whether consideration 
                      will be given to privatizing the maintenance and 
                      operational aspects of the facility, while 
                      retaining legal and administrative control of the 
                      portion of the Interstate route; and
                          (v) such other information as the Secretary 
                      may require.
            (4) Selection criteria.--The Secretary may approve the 
        application of a State under paragraph (3) only if the Secretary 
        determines that--
                    (A) the State's analysis under paragraph (3)(C) is 
                reasonable;
                    (B) the State plan for implementing tolls on the 
                facility takes into account the interests of local, 
                regional, and interstate travelers;
                    (C) the State plan for construction of the facility 
                using toll revenues is reasonable;
                    (D) the State will develop, manage, and maintain a 
                system that will automatically collect the tolls; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 1254]]

                    (E) the State has given preference to the use of a 
                public toll agency with demonstrated capability to 
                build, operate, and maintain a toll expressway system 
                meeting criteria for the Interstate System.
            (5) <<NOTE: Contracts.>> Prohibition on noncompete 
        agreements.--Before the Secretary may permit a State to 
        participate in the pilot program, the State must enter into an 
        agreement with the Secretary that provides that the State will 
        not enter into an agreement with a private person under which 
        the State is prevented from improving or expanding the capacity 
        of public roads adjacent to the toll facility to address 
        conditions resulting from traffic diverted to such roads from 
        the toll facility, including--
                    (A) excessive congestion;
                    (B) pavement wear; and
                    (C) an increased incidence of traffic accidents, 
                injuries, or fatalities.
            (6) <<NOTE: Contracts.>> Limitations on use of revenues; 
        audits.--Before the Secretary may permit a State to participate 
        in the pilot program, the State must enter into an agreement 
        with the Secretary that provides that--
                    (A) all toll revenues received from operation of the 
                toll facility will be used only for--
                          (i) debt service;
                          (ii) reasonable return on investment of any 
                      private person financing the project; and
                          (iii) any costs necessary for the improvement 
                      of and the proper operation and maintenance of the 
                      toll facility, including reconstruction, 
                      resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation of 
                      the toll facility; and
                    (B) regular audits will be conducted to ensure 
                compliance with subparagraph (A) and the results of such 
                audits will be transmitted to the Secretary.
            (7) Limitation on use of interstate maintenance funds.--
        During the term of the pilot program, funds apportioned for 
        Interstate maintenance under section 104(b)(4) of title 23, 
        United States Code, may not be used on a facility for which 
        tolls are being collected under the program.
            (8) Program term.--The Secretary may approve an application 
        of a State for permission to collect a toll under this section 
        only if the application is received by the Secretary before the 
        last day of the 10-year period beginning on the date of 
        enactment of this Act.
            (9) Interstate system defined.--In this section, the term 
        ``Interstate System'' has the meaning such term has under 
        section 101 of title 23, United States Code.

SEC. 1920. TRANSPORTATION AND LOCAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Federal-aid highway programs provide State and local 
        governments and other recipients substantial funds for projects 
        that produce significant employment and job-training 
        opportunities.
            (2) Every $1,000,000,000 in Federal infrastructure 
        investment creates an estimated 47,500 jobs.
            (3) Jobs in transportation construction, including 
        apprenticeship positions, typically pay more than twice the 
        minimum wage, and include health and other benefits.
            (4) Transportation projects provide the impetus for job 
        training and employment opportunities for low income individuals 
        residing in the area in which a transportation project is 
        planned.
            (5) Transportation projects can offer young people, 
        particularly those who are economically disadvantaged, the 
        opportunity to gain productive employment.
            (6) The Alameda Corridor, a $2,400,000,000 transportation 
        project, is an example of a transportation project that included 
        a local hiring provision resulting in a full 30 percent of the 
        project jobs being filled by locally hired and trained men and 
        women.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Federal 
transportation projects should facilitate and encourage the 
collaboration between interested persons, including Federal, State, and 
local governments, community colleges, apprentice programs, local high 
schools, and other community-based organizations that have an interest 
in improving the job skills of low-income individuals, to help leverage 
scarce training and community resources and to help ensure local 
participation in the building of transportation projects.

SEC. 1928. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BUY AMERICA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Buy America test required by section 165 of the 
        Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (23 U.S.C. 101 
        note) needs to be applied to an entire bridge project and not 
        only to component parts of such project;
            (2) the law clearly states that domestic materials must be 
        used in Federal highway projects unless there is a finding that 
        the inclusion of domestic materials will increase the cost of 
        the overall project by more than 25 percent;
            (3) uncertainty regarding how to apply Buy America laws for 
        major bridge projects threatens the domestic bridge industry;
            (4) because the Nation's unemployment rate continues to 
        hover around 5.6 percent, steps are needed to protect American 
        workers and the domestic bridge building industry; and
            (5) the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.) was 
        designed to ensure that, when taxpayer money is spent on direct 
        Federal Government procurement and infrastructure projects, 
        these expenditures stimulate United States production and job 
        creation.

SEC. 2020. PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON ALCOHOL-IMPAIRED DRIVING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there has been considerable progress over the past 25 
        years in reducing the number and rate of alcohol-related highway 
        facilities;
            (2) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
        projects that fatalities in alcohol-related crashes declined in 
        2003 for the 2nd year in a row;
            (3) in spite of this progress, an estimated 17,013 Americans 
        died in 2003, in alcohol-related crashes;
            (4) these fatalities comprise 40 percent of the annual total 
        highway fatalities;
            (5) about 250,000 are injured each year in alcohol-related 
        crashes;
            (6) the past 2 years of decreasing alcohol-related 
        fatalities follows a 3-year increase;
            (7) alcohol-impaired driving is the Nation's most frequently 
        committed violent crime;
            (8) the annual cost of alcohol-related crashes is over 
        $100,000,000,000, including $9,000,000,000 in costs to 
        employers;
            (9) a Presidential Commission on Alcohol Impaired Driving in 
        1982 and 1983 helped to lead to substantial progress on this 
        issue; and
            (10) these facts point to the need to renew the national 
        commitment to preventing these deaths and injuries.

    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, in an 
effort to further change the culture of alcohol-impaired driving on our 
Nation's highways, the President should consider establishing a 
Presidential Commission on Alcohol-Impaired Driving--
            (1) comprised of representatives of--
                    (A) State and local governments, including State 
                legislators;
                    (B) law enforcement;
                    (C) traffic safety experts, including researchers;

                    (J) Members of Congress; and
            (2) that not later than September 30, 2006, would--
                    (A) conduct a full examination of alcohol-impaired 
                driving issues; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 1544]]

                    (B) make recommendations for a broad range of policy 
                and program changes that would serve to further reduce 
                the level of deaths and injuries caused by alcohol 
                impaired driving.

SEC. 2021. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED PUBLIC 
            AWARENESS OF BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION LEVELS AND DANGERS 
            OF ALCOHOL-IMPAIRED DRIVING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in 2003--
                    (A) 17,013 Americans died in alcohol-related traffic 
                crashes;
                    (B) 40 percent of the persons killed in traffic 
                crashes died in alcohol-related crashes; and
                    (C) drivers with blood alcohol concentration levels 
                over 0.15 were involved in 58 percent of alcohol-related 
                traffic fatalities;
            (2) research shows that 77 percent of Americans think they 
        have received enough information about alcohol-impaired driving 
        and the way in which alcohol affects individual blood alcohol 
        levels; and
            (3) only 28 percent of the American public can correctly 
        identify the legal limit of blood alcohol concentration of the 
        State in which they reside.

    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should work with State 
and local governments and independent organizations to increase public 
awareness of--
            (1) State legal limits on blood alcohol concentration 
        levels; and
            (2) the dangers of alcohol-impaired driving.

        assets and liabilities is supported by the general aviation

SEC. 5103. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Research and development are critical to developing and 
        maintaining a transportation system that meets the goals of 
        safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and 
        environmental protection.
            (2) Federally sponsored surface transportation research and 
        development has produced many successes. The development of 
        rumble strips has increased safety; research on materials has 
        increased the lifespan of pavements, saving money and reducing 
        the disruption caused by construction; and Geographic 
        Information Systems have improved the management and efficiency 
        of transit fleets.
            (3) Despite these important successes, the Federal surface 
        transportation research and development investment represents 
        less than 1 percent of overall Government spending on surface 
        transportation.
            (4) While Congress increased funding for overall 
        transportation programs by about 40 percent in the 
        Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, funding for 
        transportation research and development remained relatively 
        flat.
            (5) The Federal investment in research and development 
        should be balanced between short-term applied and long-term 
        fundamental research and development. The investment should also 
        cover a wide range of research areas, including research on 
        materials and construction, research on operations, research on 
        transportation trends and human factors, and research addressing 
        the institutional barriers to deployment of new technologies.
            (6) That it is in the United States interest to increase the 
        Federal investment in transportation research and development, 
        and to conduct research in critical research gaps, in order to 
        ensure that the transportation system meets the goals of safety, 
        mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and 
        environmental protection.

        (1), the lead agency shall define the project's purpose and need 
        for purposes of any document which the lead agency is 
        responsible for preparing for the project.
            ``(3) Objectives.--The statement of purpose and need shall 
        include a clear statement of the objectives that the proposed 
        action is intended to achieve, which may include--

                identified in an applicable statewide or metropolitan

                agencies and the public in determining the range of 
                alternatives to be considered for a project.

                the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a 
                project, after being identified, may be developed to a 
                higher level of detail than other alternatives in order 
                to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or 
                concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the 
                lead agency determines that the development of such 
                higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency 
                from making an impartial decision as to whether to 
                accept another alternative which is being considered in 
                the environmental review process.

Subtitle A--General Authorities on Transportation of Hazardous Materials

SEC. 7101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) <<NOTE: 49 USC 5101 note.>> Findings.--Congress finds with 
respect to hazardous materials transportation that--
            (1) approximately 4,000,000,000 tons of regulated hazardous 
        materials are transported each year and approximately 1,200,000 
        movements of hazardous materials occur each day, according to 
        Department of Transportation estimates;
            (2) the movement of hazardous materials in commerce is 
        necessary to maintain economic vitality and meet consumer 
        demands and must be conducted in a safe, secure, and efficient 
        manner;
            (3) accidents involving, or unauthorized access to, 
        hazardous materials in transportation may result in a release of 
        such materials and pose a serious threat to public health and 
        safety;
            (4) because of the potential risks to life, property, and 
        the environment posed by unintentional releases of hazardous 
        materials, consistency in laws and regulations governing the 
        transportation of hazardous materials is necessary and 
        desirable; and
            (5) in order to provide reasonable, adequate, and cost-
        effective protection from the risks posed by the transportation 
        of hazardous materials, a network of well-trained State and 
        local emergency response personnel and hazmat employees is 
        essential.

    (b) Purpose.--Section 5101 <<NOTE: 49 USC 5101.>> is amended by 
striking ``The purpose'' and all that follows through the period at the 
end and inserting the following: ``The purpose of this chapter is to 
protect

[[Page 119 STAT. 1892]]

against the risks to life, property, and the environment that are 
inherent in the transportation of hazardous material in intrastate, 
interstate, and foreign commerce.''.

                the rescission calculated under subsection (c)(1) for a 
                covered program exceeds the amount calculated for the 
                covered program under subsection (c)(2), the State shall 
                immediately restore to the apportionment account for the 
                covered program from the unobligated balances of 
                programs referred to in subsection (a) (other than 
                covered programs) the amount of funds required so that 
                the net rescission from the covered program does not 
                exceed the amount calculated for the covered program 
                under subsection (c)(2).

SEC. 11142. NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING 
            COMMISSION.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established a National Surface 
Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission (in this section 
referred to as the ``Commission''). The Commission shall hold its first 
meeting within 90 days of the appointment of the eighth individual to be 
named to the Commission.
    (b) Function.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall, with respect to the 
        period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and 
        ending before 2016--
                    (A) make a thorough investigation and study of 
                revenues flowing into the Highway Trust Fund under 
                current law, including the individual components of the 
                overall flow of such revenues;
                    (B) consider whether the amount of such revenues is 
                likely to increase, decline, or remain unchanged, absent 
                changes in the law, particularly by taking into account 
                the impact of possible changes in public vehicular 
                choice, fuel use, or travel alternatives that could be 
                expected to reduce or increase revenues into the Highway 
                Trust Fund;
                    (C) consider alternative approaches to generating 
                revenues for the Highway Trust Fund, and the level of 
                revenues that such alternatives would yield;
                    (D) consider highway and transit needs and whether 
                additional revenues into the Highway Trust Fund, or 
                other Federal revenues dedicated to highway and transit 
                infrastructure, would be required in order to meet such 
                needs;
                    (E) consider a program that would exempt all or a 
                portion of gasoline or other motor fuels used in a State 
                from the Federal excise tax on such gasoline or other 
                motor fuels if such State elects not to receive all or a 
                portion of Federal transportation funding, including--
                          (i) whether such State should be required to 
                      increase State gasoline or other motor fuels taxes 
                      by the amount of the decrease in the Federal 
                      excise tax on such gasoline or other motor fuels;
                          (ii) whether any Federal transportation 
                      funding should not be reduced or eliminated for 
                      States participating in such program; and
                          (iii) whether there are any compliance 
                      problems related to enforcement of Federal 
                      transportation-related excise taxes under such 
                      program; and

[[Page 119 STAT. 1962]]

                    (F) study such other matters closely related to the 
                subjects described in the preceding subparagraphs as it 
                may deem appropriate.
            (2) Preparation of report.--Based on such investigation and 
        study, the Commission shall develop a final report, with 
        recommendations and the bases for those recommendations, 
        indicating policies that should be adopted, or not adopted, to 
        achieve various levels of annual revenue for the Highway Trust 
        Fund and to enable the Highway Trust Fund to receive revenues 
        sufficient to meet highway and transit needs. Such 
        recommendations shall address, among other matters as the 
        Commission may deem appropriate--
                    (A) what levels of revenue are required by the 
                Federal Highway Trust Fund in order for it to meet needs 
                to maintain and improve the condition and performance of 
                the Nation's highway and transit systems;
                    (B) what levels of revenue are required by the 
                Federal Highway Trust Fund in order to ensure that 
                Federal levels of investment in highways and transit do 
                not decline in real terms; and
                    (C) the extent, if any, to which the Highway Trust 
                Fund should be augmented by other mechanisms or funds as 
                a Federal means of financing highway and transit 
                infrastructure investments.

SEC. 11144. TREASURY STUDY OF HIGHWAY FUELS USED BY TRUCKS FOR NON-
            TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES.

    (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study 
regarding the use of highway motor fuel by trucks that is not used for 
the propulsion of the vehicle. As part of such study--
            (1) in the case of vehicles carrying equipment that is 
        unrelated to the transportation function of the vehicle--
                    (A) the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
                with the Secretary of Transportation, and with public 
                notice and comment, shall determine the average annual 
                amount of tax-paid fuel consumed per vehicle, by type of 
                vehicle, used by the propulsion engine to provide the 
                power to operate the equipment attached to the highway 
                vehicle, and
                    (B) the Secretary of the Treasury shall review the 
                technical and administrative feasibility of exempting 
                such nonpropulsive use of highway fuels from the highway 
                motor fuels excise taxes, and, if such exemptions are 
                technically and administratively feasible, shall propose 
                options for implementing such exemptions for--
                          (i) mobile machinery (as defined in section 
                      4053(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) 
                      whose nonpropulsive fuel use exceeds 50 percent, 
                      and
                          (ii) any highway vehicle which consumes fuel 
                      for both transportation and non-transportation-
                      related equipment, using a single motor,
            (2) in the case where non-transportation equipment is run by 
        a separate motor--
                    (A) the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine 
                the annual average amount of fuel exempted from tax in 
                the use of such equipment by equipment type, and
                    (B) the Secretary of the Treasury shall review 
                issues of administration and compliance related to the 
                present-law exemption provided for such fuel use, and
            (3) the Secretary of the Treasury shall--
                    (A) estimate the amount of taxable fuel consumed by 
                trucks and the emissions of various pollutants due to 
                the long-term idling of diesel engines, and
                    (B) determine the cost of reducing such long-term 
                idling through the use of plug-ins at truck stops, 
                auxiliary power units, or other technologies.

[[Page 119 STAT. 1966]]

    (b) Report.--Not later than January 1, 2007, the Secretary of the 
Treasury shall report the findings of the study required under 
subsection (a) to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.

the House of Representatives on--
            (1) the availability of new technologies, including forensic

        the Internal Revenue Service to employ such technologies,
            (2) the design of a test to place forensic or chemical 
        molecular markers in any excluded liquid (as defined in section 
        48.4081-1(b) of title 26, Code of Federal Regulations),
            (3) the design of a test, in consultation with the 
        Department of Defense, to place forensic or chemical molecular 
        markers in all nonstrategic bulk fuel deliveries of diesel fuel 
        to the military, and
            (4) the design of a test to place forensic or chemical 
        molecular markers in all diesel fuel bound for export utilizing 
        the Gulf of Mexico.

        which are an essential governmental function within the meaning 
        of section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, income 
        derived from such activities by the corporation shall be treated 
        as accruing to the State for purposes of section 115 of such 
        Code.

    (b) Gain or Loss not Recognized on Conversion.--Notwithstanding 
section 337(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986--

        337 of such Code, and
            (2) no change in basis of the property of such corporation
